General Hollister.

3
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,504
Come in.

4
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:09,281
You want a drink?
No. No, thank you, sir.
I don't have much time.

5
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,516
I would have called, but...
But what?

6
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,525
I didn't want to risk a wiretap.

7
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,295
A wiretap?

8
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,297
You sound paranoid, Colonel.

9
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,458
No, General.
Just being cautious.

10
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,197
And the reason
for this... caution?

11
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,205
The word just came down
this morning.

12
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,741
A special directive
to all section chiefs.

13
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:33,472
The Inspector General's
starting a full-scale investigation
of arms contracts.

14
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,539
I see.

15
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,878
You're sure?
Yes, sir.

16
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,124
That's unfortunate.

17
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,127
But I suppose it would have
happened sooner or later.

18
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,323
If they find out...
They won't find out.

19
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,866
General,
if anyone digs deep enough...

20
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,836
they're bound to discover that
I've let your construction company
charge us a fortune in cost overruns.

21
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,839
You'll offer
the standard explanation...

22
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,001
unforeseen difficulties
in developing the arms system.

23
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,446
It won't stand up, General.
When the I.G. Sees
your bargain-basement bids...

24
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,675
he'll know I let you
practically steal those contracts.

25
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,741
They'll indict both of us.

26
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,519
As you say, Colonel,
you're the one that accepted the bids.

27
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,581
You approved the overruns.

28
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,857
With that much money involved,
they'll know we had to be in it together.
I'm getting out.

29
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,455
Oh?

30
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,523
I'm leaving for Geneva tonight.

31
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:33,800
And if I may make a suggestion,
General, you might do the same.
I have a business to run.

32
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,133
Besides, I never believed
in a forced retreat.

33
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,238
<i>Well, maybe you can bluff them, sir,</i>
<i>but I don't have your reputation.</i>

34
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:46,581
You'll have less
of a reputation if you go AWOL.
It's an admission of guilt.

35
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,144
They won't know it for 30 days.
I just took my annual leave.

36
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,690
It's a small world, Colonel.
They'll find you.

37
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,158
No way, sir.
I'll manage to disappear.

38
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:02,026
And, uh, if they do,
just for the sake of argument?

39
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,870
Naturally, l-I'd keep your
involvement to myself.
I'd refuse to testify.

40
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,203
Not even to shorten a jail sentence
for giving evidence?

41
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,807
Believe me, sir,
there's nothing to worry about.
They won't know where I am.

42
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,388
How did you get here, Colonel?
Taxi?

43
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,395
<i>No, sir. I drove. Why?</i>

44
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,988
I've been thinking.

45
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,057
You present me with a problem.

46
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,103
Problem?

47
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:43,599
You assure me... that my name
will never come into this...

48
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,476
that, uh, you'll be my protector.

49
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,343
I'm afraid I can't take that risk.

No. No, we're going back.

00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,280
We're going what?
Which way is back?

60
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,581
Which way is...
What are you doing?
Ooh! Ooh!

61
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,751
I got it. It's all right.

What are you gonna do?

81

I mean, I can tell them apart,
but not what they're wearing,
you know. But...

96
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,257
Well, l-I'm sure
it was a military uniform.

Mm-mm.

Just because you were
looking in the other direction
doesn't mean that I didn't see it.

It just doesn't seem right

Stand by,

Yes, sir.

That's General Hollister's house
right there.

Did anyone come in or out
since you've been here?

133
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,431
Two young fellows in cadet uniforms
went in a little while ago.

134
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,338
That's their wagon over there.
Uh-huh.

135
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,899
Is there another way
out of this house?
By water.

136
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,036
The general's got a yacht
in a slip in back of the house.

137
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,877
I see. I'm gonna go in
and speak to the general.

138

While I'm doing that,
I want you to search the yacht.

But, Lieutenant,
I don't have a warrant.

140
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,012
Well, I'll ask the general
for permission.

141
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,115
If he doesn't give it,
then I'll get a warrant.

<i>In the meantime, check it out.</i>

00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,045
That's quite an opening line,
Lieutenant.

152
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,386
Sir, I'm sure it's just
a crackpot complaint, but I...

153
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,688
But it's your job to follow it up.

154
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,853
Yes, sir.

155
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:21,161
I understand. I've had to do
many unpleasant things myself
in the line of duty.

156
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:25,067
But may I ask, this alleged shooting...

157
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,469
Just who is supposed
to have shot whom?

158
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,065
Well, you see, sir,
we don't know exactly.

159
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,873
Only that the, uh, victim
was wearing some kind of a uniform.

160
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,471
A uniform.

161
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,674
Well, come in.

162
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:48,425
These young men are from
my alma mater, Lieutenant, M.M.I.

163
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,658
They're here to take away
my military souvenirs for, uh...

164
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:56,724
permanent enshrinement
at the Memorial Hall.

165
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:02,904
As a matter of fact, Lieutenant,
M.M.I. Is giving me
a testimonial dinner tonight.

166
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,173
<i>[Hammering]</i>
They're commemorating
the 20th anniversary of my retirement...

167
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,180
and the opening
of the Hollister Exhibit.

168
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:14,049
Yes. General, do you think
I could, uh, look inside?

169
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:19,490
Lieutenant,
wouldn't that be a little obvious?

170
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:24,359
I wanna be in a position, sir,
where I can tell my superiors
that I've checked everything out.

171
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,925
They've already started
nailing it shut.
Uh, it's just two nails, sir.

172
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:35,633
Very well. Gentlemen,
I have a friend here who would like
to inspect the contents of the crate.

173
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,700
Would you open it again, please?
Yes, sir.

174
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,518
Wow!

175
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,525
A lot of guns.
[Chuckles]

176
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,391
War trophies, Lieutenant.

177
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:01,866
Uh, AK-47 assault rifle.

178
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,096
<i>PPSH-41.</i> Drum.

179
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,973
PPSH-41clip.

180
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:20,216
All Soviet-made, and,
as you've observed,
all with their firing pins removed.

181
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:24,245
I see. They're very,
very interesting, General.
[Clicks]

182
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,355
War mementos, Lieutenant.

183
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,868
<i>Lively memories, empty uniforms...</i>

184
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:42,704
uh, all carefully packed,
Lieutenant, for the exhibit.

185
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:47,735
Oh. Oh, yes, of course.
I'm sorry, sir. Uh...

186
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:51,374
I'll just put these back in here.

187
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,318
There you are. I, uh...

188
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,584
I think that, uh, is fine.
Thank you very much.

189
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,648
Carry on, gentlemen.

190
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:06,259
Could I offer you something?
Oh, no. Thank you very much.

191
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,233
Say, you got a beautiful place here.
Thank you.

192
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,566
It's roomy, and it's homey, and...

193
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,572
That's a fireplace.

194
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,540
Wow!

195
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:20,169
You know, when I was a kid,
we used to have those
fake wooden kinds.

196
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,179
I don't know if you remember
them or not, General.

197
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,774
They had a fan in the back.
And it had a red light and ribbons.

198
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,218
You'd turn on the fan,
and the ribbons,
they would flutter there.

199
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,984
Yeah, they were terrific.

200
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,424
That's funny.
What's funny?

201
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,826
Don't you have those irons?

202
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,865
You know, like you put in a fireplace
to put the, uh...

203
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,424
Oh. Uh, andirons.
Andirons. Yeah.

204
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,630
No. I never build a fire there.
It's too much trouble.
Oh.

205
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,697
Easier to turn up the thermostat.
I see.

206
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,769
Uh...
Oh, uh, for show.

207
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,041
Oh, that's for show.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

208
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,050
Lieutenant, I've been thinking.

209
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,609
The person who turned in
that report was right.

210
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,121
There was someone here
in uniform.

211
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,180
Me.

212
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,693
While I was packing...

213
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:15,132
I couldn't resist, uh,
trying on the old harness, you know.

214
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,692
I'm glad to be able to tell you
that, uh, I can still get into it.

215
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:23,435
You know, the report said
there was another man here,
and he was dressed in a bathrobe.

216
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,501
Whoever filed that report
was seeing double.

217
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,514
Yes, I was wearing a bathrobe
while I was packing.

218
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,247
Got a match?
A match.

219
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,483
There you are.
Thank you.

220
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,229
Hey, that's quite a lighter.
<i>One of a kind.</i>

221
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,734
Yeah, that's something.
[Coughs]

222
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,863
Didn't you say that you
were gonna send all of your stuff
over to the exhibit?

223
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,237
Not quite everything, Lieutenant.

224
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,868
This has a very
personal meaning for me.

225
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,175
It's a gift from my staff
on the day that I retired from service.

226
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,307
Oh. Yeah.

227
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,251
General, uh,
do you mind if I look around?

228
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,447
No. By all means,
help yourself.

229
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,219
Not much to see here.

230
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,763
Just a basic B.O.Q.

231
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,391
I guess that's why I like it.

232
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:30,066
<i>Any servants?</i>
Just a housekeeper.
Comes in twice a week.

233
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,076
Good night, General.

234
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,305
Oh. Let me get the door.

235
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,977
Careful.

236
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,015
Good night.

237
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,399
Lieutenant,
the bedrooms are this way.

238
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,201
Guest bedroom, Lieutenant.

239
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,075
Master bedroom.

240
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,085
<i>General, have you</i>
<i>been here all day?</i>

241
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,054
No. I was out on my boat
till about 2:00.

242
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,750
You didn't go out after that, sir?
No.

243
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:24,159
I was here packing, getting ready
for the testimonial dinner.

244
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,789
Do you mind if I look in your closet?
No.

245
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,299
By all means,
be thorough, Lieutenant.

246
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,463
Extra uniforms.

247
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,974
General,
that's a lot of fruit salad.

248
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,780
Past history... all to be donated,
Lieutenant.

249
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,082
Well, you've had the tour.
Anything else I can do for you?

250
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,952
No, I guess that's it.

251
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,019
Unless...

252
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,028
Unless what?

253
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:01,623
Well, as long as I'm here, uh...

254
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,691
do you happen
to own a gun, General?

255
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:08,399
A handgun?
A hand... Oh. No, I...

256
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,933
Yes. Yes, I do.

257
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,741
A target pistol.
[Chuckles]

258
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:20,547
It's a funny thing.
I never think of it as a weapon.

259
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,883
.22 caliber Hi-Standard.

260
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,891
Supermatic Trophy model.
There you are. Hmm?

261
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,094
What's that medal for?

262
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,154
Oh,
[Chuckles]

263
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,099
That's a first with
the United States Marine Pistol Team.

264
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,834
You know, Lieutenant, uh...

265
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,142
I had this out earlier today.

266
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,272
I was thinking of giving
it over to the exhibition...

267
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,718
although it's never had anything to do
with my military career.

268
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,855
I was, uh...

269
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:02,451
I... Oh, yes!

270
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,923
Yes, I remember now.

271
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,525
I stumbled over the crate
as I was looking at the gun.

272
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:14,431
- That must've been what your witness saw.
- Of course.

273
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,134
Oh, well, there we are, huh?

274
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,375
There we are.

275
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,286
Oh.
[Laughs]

276
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,517
I doubt if I could...
if I could win any medals today.

277
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,083
I've been so busy for months,
I haven't had any chance to practice.

278
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,459
[Sniffs]
Here, see for yourself.

279
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,862
Well, I'm not
a ballistics expert, sir.

280
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:45,096
Well, take it along with you.
Have your people check it out.

281
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,936
No, I don't think
that'll be necessary, sir.

282
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,568
I think I'm on a wild-goose chase.
[Chuckles]

283
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:58,048
Matter of fact, uh,
I don't think there's much else
I can, uh, look for, General.

284
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,641
Uh, I think
I'll be running along.

285
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,415
Before you go, Lieutenant, uh...

286
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:08,892
just who, uh...
who reported <i>this... murder?</i>

287
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,894
No, I never said
it was a murder, sir.

288
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,955
Well, this alleged shooting.
Who turned in the report?

289
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,024
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that, sir.
Oh.

290
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,162
No, sir.
That's against regulations.
Oh, yes, of course.

291
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,730
Well, there's one thing for sure...

292
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,768
that whoever it was,
it had to be some...

293
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,007
some guy out here
in a boat in the marina.

294
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,983
General, I'd like to keep
the record straight on that.

295
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:36,418
Now, I never said
that it was a man.

296
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,855
Oh, you mean it was a woman?
Now, I never said that either, sir.

297
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,553
Well, it doesn't make any difference.

298
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,561
Mistakes have no gender.

299
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,223
Well, that's for sure.
[Chuckles]

300
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,167
Uh... Well, I want to apologize
for takir up your time.

301
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,170

Uh, your boat.
What about it?

305
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,844
I had the boat checked out,
sir, while we were talking.

306
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,187
I didn't think you had anything
to hide, sir, and I just thought
it would save some time.

307
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:20,129
I always preached initiative to my men,
so I don't see how I can object now.

And you're right.
You did save time.

Mr. Barnes, a couple of hours ago,
out on the marina,
somebody waved at me.

00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:38,406
I think it was an old friend.
You got any idea who it could have been?

I think it might have been, yeah.
You might have it there in the record.

- It was probably Mrs. Stewart

- Mrs. Stewart. That's it.

Do you know where she lives?
I'd like to have a few words with her.

Yeah, sure. I got it right here.
Good.

Hey, General, you're not gonna
go sailing with her, are you?
Why?

331
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,991
She's the worst...

332
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,797
She can't sail.
I couldn't take my eyes off her.
Really?

333
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,100
I thought that she was gonna
keel over any minute.

any evidence of any shooting
in that house that you pointed out.

00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:43,784
- Maybe you think you saw it.
- What does that mean?

391

The fella that owns that house
is a retired marine general.

saw him in the window...

393
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:54,096
one, he was alone,
and two, he was wearing a bathrobe.

395
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,294
<i>He says that later on,</i>
<i>he did try on an old uniform...</i>

396

and he was carrying
a target pistol at the time.

397
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,737
He says he happened to trip over
a crate that he was packing.

398
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:11,476
Now, to you, does, uh...
does that sound like
a reasonable explanation?

399
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:16,418
Oh, very reasonable,
but it's not what I saw.

400
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,855
Uh-huh. I see.

401
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,984
Uh, did you ever wear glasses?

402
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,030
No, I don't wear glasses.
I have perfect vision.

403
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,658
- No, I have better than perfect vision.
- Mm-hmm.

404
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:35,263

I'm just trying to reconcile
your story.

410

one in a bathrobe,
and the other one in a uniform.

411

shot the other man.

449
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:55,524
<i>If any man in recent memory</i>
<i>may be said to have had charisma...</i>

450
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,559
certainly that man
was General Martin J. Hollister.

451
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:04,939
Early on in the Korean War,
as a colonel commanding
a regiment of armored cavalry...

452
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,706
Hollister captured the imagination
of the American people.

453
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,580
His courage, his brilliance in improvising
in the heat of battle...

454
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:18,213
his colorful garb...
riding breeches, boots
and pearl-handled Colt.45...

455
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:22,487
soon earned him the nickname
'The Iron Horseman."

456
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,394
<i>Later as a brigadier general</i>
<i>with his own division...</i>

457
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,127
he distinguished himself
by a daring end-run in which...

458
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:35,969
out of ammunition
and using only his famous pistol
and a monumental bluff...

459
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,842
<i>he succeeded in capturing</i>
<i>the opposing enemy commander</i>
<i>and his entire headquarters.</i>

460
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:46,782
Finally, a land mine accomplished
what nothing else could...

461
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,548
put General Hollister out of action
with severe wounds...

462
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:55,422
wounds that necessitated
his untimely retirement
from active duty...

463
00:34:55,493 --> 00:35:01,022
as one of the youngest major generals
in this natiors military history.

464
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:07,396
On the foreign scene,
the Secretary of State again reiterated...

465
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:11,875
the United States's determination
to keep current troop levels
in Europe stable.

shoot someone for no reason at all?

468
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,685

to show up on our doorstep.

471

Why don't you just admit
that you're not sure?

You had him running around

475
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,830
No wonder
he asked for a divorce.

Those were not mirages, Mother!

477

Those were flesh-and-blood ladies
he was carrying on with.

478
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,840

00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:22,107
Tom... why, th-that's my ex...
he didn't want children.

598

one battle...

Mrs. Stewart.

601

602
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,552
Well, what about you?
Are you married?

603
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:41,689
No. Never could find the time.

604
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:44,962
First, there was my military career.

605
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:50,871
And then, my construction company.
I was married to the business, as they say.

606
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:55,207
Well, l-I can understand that.

607
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,372

608
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:00,712
Not really.

609
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:03,810
Oh, there are exceptions.
Like, uh...

610
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:07,687
last night, when the door opened
and I saw you.

611
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:12,457
[Chuckles]
Oh, come on, General.

612

not see through that remark, do you?

613
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,195
Now, what do you mean by that?

614
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:25,571
Well, yesterday I called the police...

615
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:29,840
and l-I reported that
I saw you shoot a man.

616
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,715
<i>And today, you're telling me that when</i>
<i>you saw me, music filled your ears...</i>

617
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,719

00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,431
I meant it, though.

622
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:55,960
And to prove that,
I want to take you to dinner.

623
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,873
<i>Agreed?</i>

624
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,741
I'll take that for a yes.

625
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:13,188
And if Helen had just closed her eyes
to some ofTom's... flirtations...

626
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:15,748
they might still be married!

627
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,795
Whatever happened
to your husband, Mrs. Walters?

628
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:21,922
Who knows! Sent him out
for Chinese food thirty years <i>ago...</i>

629
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,297
and I haven't
heard from him since.

630
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:29,567
You know that I have
raised that girl since she was
three years old, single-handed?

Hello, Lieutenant.

Well, I hope you don't
expect to eat now.

634
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,648
No.
I already had dinner.

635
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:44,016
At a lovely restaurant
overlooking the city.
It was just beautiful.

636
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,180
Well, you might have called.

637
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,190
Did you dine alone?

638
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:54,189
Why, no. Not this time.

639
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,324
As a matter of fact, I had
dinner with General Hollister.

640
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,995
<i>General Hollister!</i>

641
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,096
Well, what do you know about that?
Are you gonna see him again?

642
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:08,335
Well, he-he asked me
to come out on his yacht.
[Giggles]

643
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:12,041
Well, that calls for a drink.

644

You play your cards right...
bourbon today, champagne tomorrow.

645
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:23,983
Makes you kinda
wonder, doesn't it?
About the General.

646
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:29,124
What do you mean?
I didn't tell him your name, you know.
And I didn't tell him where you lived.

647
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,693
So, uh, he musta gone
to a lot of trouble to find you.

648
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,330
Curiosity about his accuser.

649
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:40,502
Yeah, could be that.
Course, it could be something else.

650
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,275
Oh, thanks a lot, Lieutenant.

651
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:49,683
Am I so uninteresting that he couldn't
be interested in me for myself?

652
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:53,086
Oh, no. No, no.
No, I didn't mean that at all.

653
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,351
You're a very individual person.

654
00:49:55,425 --> 00:50:00,829
No, what I was talking about
was the shooting. You see, I had
second thoughts about the shooting.

655
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:03,798
You see, our traffic people, they
picked up a couple of kids.

656
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,165
They were joyriding in a car
they hot-wired.

657
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:09,330
And it turned out this car belonged
to a Roger Dutton...

658
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,239
and he's a Marine colonel,
Mrs. Stewart.

659
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:16,575
And it could be that
he was the man that you saw
in the General's house.

660
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:20,850
You know, you did a lot of
investigating...

661
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:25,616
for a man who asked me if I wore
glasses, or if I had been drinking.

662
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,623
Well, that's just
part of the job. Anyway...

663
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,955
I found out this Colonel Dutton...

664
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,155
booked a passage on an 8:00 p.m.
Flight to Switzerland.

665
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,859
But then, he never showed up
to take the plane.

666
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,026
Well, l-I still don't
get the connection.

667
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,935
No, you see, this Colonel Dutton...

668
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:44,496
he was in the Marine
Matriel Command...

669
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,702
[Scoffs]
That's a, uh, he's
a procurement officer.

670
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:52,806
But he had a lotta dealings
with General Hollister.

671
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:57,217
And he suddenly took a leave
and then he just disappeared.

672
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:04,717
Now, if you could identify
the officer in this photograph...

673
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,696
as the man that
General Hollister shot...

674
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,928
Then, I think, a lot of
these pieces would fall into place.

675
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:21,167
L-I can't be sure.

676
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,077
Well, now that photograph
is three years old...
It all happened so quick.

to protect you.

745
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,300
Protect me?
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

746
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:13,213
You see, I know
that this is ridiculous...

747
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,911
but the fellas down there
at the department, they're sayir...

748
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,283
they've got some kind of
a pretty good case against you.

749
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,948
- Oh? [Chuckles]
- Yeah.

750
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:24,323
- Of course, they're way out
of line, I know that.
- Of course, of course.

751
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:28,330
<i>But you know, they have these ideas,</i>
<i>and it could be embarrassing.</i>

752
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,993
I tell ya, I, uh...
I kinda hate to get into it.

753
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:37,199
- I mean, a man of your stature...
- By all means, get into it, Lieutenant.

754
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:38,968
Yes, sir.

755
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:46,147
<i>[Columbo] Well, take motive.</i>

756
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:51,084
Your construction company got a lot
of contracts through Colonel Dutton.

757
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,122
So did hundreds of other companies.

758
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:57,785
Yeah, but it seems as though
he was being investigated
by the Inspector General.

759
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,920
And if he were killed, there
would be no way of proving...

760
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,965
a conspiracy
to defraud the government.

761
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,964
Well, if no one's around, perhaps
that means it doesn't exist!

762
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,198
<i>[Engine Rewing]</i>
Right.

763
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,741
Right, that's a good point.

764
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,778
Uh, there's one other thing.

765
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:19,303
Uh, the morning
after he disappeared...

766
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,873
you went out on your yacht.

767
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,181
Sheer coincidence.

768
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:28,917
Yeah, it probably is.
But we do know that the body
was disposed of at sea.

769
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:31,586
Now, I've been studying
the tides, General.

770
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:34,721
Now, the Coast and Geodetic
Survey's got a book on 'em...

771
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:39,166
and it shows that a body dumped
off the marina in the ocean...

772
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:41,703
might carry down
to Marago Cove.

773
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:45,935
Might, Lieutenant. Might.

774
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,739
Sheer speculation!

775
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:54,147
Lieutenant, you should tell
your... colleagues...

776
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:57,675
that they have yet to show any link
between Colonel Dutton and myself...

777
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:03,056
something that would prove
that we actually met on that day.

778
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,924
Yes, sir, uh, you're right there.

779
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:10,955
But now that you mention it,
it occurs to me that the night
that the colonel disappeared...

780
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:15,232
I did see a car like his
across the street from your house.

781
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,467
I don't know what kind
of a car the colonel drove...

782
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:22,534
but there must be thousands
of them in Southern California.

783
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:26,673
<i>You didn't, uh, by any chance...</i>
[Sighing Deeply]

784
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:29,650
<i>Check the registration at the time?</i>

785
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:33,655
Uh, no, sir. No, sir, I didn't.

786
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:39,585
- There's no reason to.
- Now, that was unfortunate, wasn't it?

787
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:41,653
<i>[Revs Engine]</i>

788
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:05,313
Uh, General, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go back now.

789
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:10,655
Yes, as you wish. I guess we're
about through with this test run.

790
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,093
<i>[Rewing Faster]</i>

791
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:26,000
You know, Lieutenant,
I don't see how a man...

792
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:30,378
with the name of' Columbo"...

793
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,971
Shouldn't he be
more at home on a boat?

794
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,981
Must have been another branch
of the family, sir.

795
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:43,025
How soon before we land?

796
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,451
Not long.

01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,405
[Groans]

798
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:13,186
You know, General, there is a link
between you and Colonel Dutton.

799
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,692
Really?
Mrs. Stewart.

800
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:20,695
An eyewitness to the murder
of a military man in your house.

801
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,723
Help the lady aboard.

802
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:43,843
Oh! Oh, Lieutenant, would you...
[Fussing]
Let me take the bag.

803
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,014
Well, no, maybe you better...
Could you just... Yeah. No, no. Yeah.

804
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:49,284
Should I take the bag? All right.
Yeah, yeah. [Grunts]
All right?

805
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,293
There we are.
Okay? Oh!
Thank you. Thank you.

806
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,692
Are you all right?
Me? Fine.

807
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:01,897
Just fine, yes. There's something
I wanted to talk to you about,
Mrs. Stewart.

808
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:05,202
Uh, we've just recovered a body.

809
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:08,801
A Colonel Dutton, the man
that I spoke to you about?

810
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,039
Somebody dumped him
in the ocean.

811
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,911
He thinks I shot him.
What I think is unimportant.

812
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:16,816
What counts is what you saw.

813
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,221
[Scoffs] I...
Well, l-I didn't see anything.

814
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,224
Well, now, Mrs. Stewart,
that's not what you said.

815
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:26,750
Well, no, it was the light,
some crazy reflection...

816
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,763
Yeah, but you told me
that you distinctly...

817
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:30,992
I don't care what I said.
I was wrong.

818
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:36,403
- Can't a person make a mistake?
- Look, maybe if I could talk
about this later on.

819
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:40,704
I'm gonna say the same thing later
that I'm saying now, so would ya...

820
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,971
Would you just
please leave me alone?

821
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:50,708
If you ever want to go out again,
I'll be happy to take you, Columbo.

01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:17,875
Hey, Lieutenant. How goes it?

So-so, huh?

825
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:25,883
How 'bout a bowl of chili?

826
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,384
- Bert, gimme some chili.
- Ah, there you go.

Here you go.
Help yourself.

01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,542
How do you like that coffee?
Is that black?
What's this?

835
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,608
What is this?
That's my helmet from the war.

836
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,154
- What war?
- What war. World War II!

837
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:01,280
My wife says I can never
throw anything out.

838
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:04,383
So the other day she put
her foot down. She says
either the junk goes or she goes.

839
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,894
You decided to keep her.

840
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:11,031
[Sighs]
It was a tough decision.

841
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,193
Anyway, I brought all
my war trophies over here.

842
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:15,635
Hey! Wait a minute.

843

appreciate this. I'll get you
another bowl of chili.

Here. Yeah, I got this, that...
Look at this.

845
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:25,141
Like, I saved a little...
It's a Japanese stirring spoon.

846
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:29,048
I got 'em at Okinawa,
the commissary. Yeah.
[Chuckles] Ah, well.

847
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:32,884
You know, I guess my wife is right.
I can't give anything away.

848
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:34,946
Especially when it means
something to ya.

849
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:41,087
<i>Yeah, that was</i>
<i>a long time ago, Lieutenant.</i>

Yeah.
Bert, gimme a dime.

851
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:49,795
<i>Okay, Lieutenant.</i>
<i>There you go.</i>

852
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,272

Mrs. Stewart?
Listen.

01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:46,193
I appreciate very much
your coming down here
and meeting me.

857
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:51,165
Just remember our agreement,
Lieutenant. No questions and no
trying to get me to change my mind.

858
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,396
Not one question.
Not even a half a question.

859
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,597
I only wanted you
to see the exhibit.

860
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,641
Why?
Look.

861
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:06,511
In order to understand a man,
you have to understand his past.

862
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,791
Quite a collection, huh?

863
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:34,865
You see that book?
That's a <i>Marine Military Manual.</i>

864
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:40,746
Do you know the story
behind that book?
No. Mm-mm.

865
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:45,310
Martin wanted to wait till the first
rush of tourists had passed, so he
could explain everything to me himself.

866
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:49,847
Oh. Gee, I guess he wants you
to know what kind of man he is too.

867
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:54,023
About this book.
There's a bullet in that book.

868
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,831
<i>A sniper tried to kill him.</i>

869
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:01,597
<i>And that book stopped a bullet.</i>
<i>And you know, he never batted an eye?</i>

870
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:05,902
I mean, that... that tells you something
about what kind of man he is.

871
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,342
Yes, that he's a man
filled with courage.

872
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:12,676
More than a great deal.
I think he has an unusual
amount of courage.

873
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,046
More than you and I,
and more than average people.

874
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,051
I mean, if was me,
I would faint.

875
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:20,555
<i>I mean, most people would</i>
<i>take time to recover.</i>

876
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:22,750
<i>But he didn't.</i>

877
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:27,956
You see, I think he's, uh...
He's a very a cool man under pressure.

878
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:38,071
Hey, that's nice, isn't it? Isn't that
beautifully cut? Custom tailored.

879
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,074
<i>You know, I think</i>
<i>it's almost too nice.</i>

880
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:44,705
I mean, all that concern about clothes,
it's kinda vain, don't you think?

881
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:48,011
[Clicks Tongue]
Some men, Lieutenant...

882
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:51,644
do not want to look like
an unmade bed.

883
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,762
Just look at this stuff.
[Clicks Tongue]

884
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,234
Look at that!

885
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:16,308
I mean, this man just had
a natural flair for attracting
attention to himself.

886
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:21,145
Sometimes undesirable
attention, Lieutenant.

887
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,151
You don't seem
surprised to see me.

888
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:27,349
Oh, I was kind of expecting you.
I mean, when I spoke to Mrs. Stewart...

889
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,448
I had a hunch that she'd tell you.

890
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:31,857
<i>I'd like to know what this is all about.</i>

891
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:35,294
All right, sir.
I'll get right to the point.

892
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:38,900
It's has to do with
that duplicate of your gun.

893
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,959
What about it?

894
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,701
Well, I find it hard to believe...

895
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:47,207
Mrs. Stewart, see if you
agree with me on this...

896
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,906
lfind it hard to believe
that a man like General Hollister...

897
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:54,677
who saved and cherished
every war souvenir...

898
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,150
even the smallest photograph...

899
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:02,813
I just think it's strange
that he was so careless as
to allow his gun to be stolen.

900
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:08,386
<i>I mean, that pistol was the most famous</i>
<i>single symbol ofhis whole legend.</i>

901
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,799
You agree with me, don't you?

902
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,434
Well... [Sighs]

903
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,500
I don't know what
you want me to say.

904
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:25,706
Well, if it was me...
if it was my gun...

905
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:28,113
I would take very good care
of that gun.

906
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:30,981
I'd have it in my apartment
where people could see it...

907
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:34,614
and I would keep it polished,
and I would keep it oiled...

908
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,090
and I would keep it loaded.

909
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:42,061
And when a certain Colonel Dutton
came to see me...

910
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,599
and threatened to expose me,

911
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:47,261
that's the gun that I would use.

912
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:52,704
Well, if what you say is true,
I mean, you searched!

913
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:56,711
- Where <i>is</i> that gun?
- That's what I asked myself.

914
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:59,714
Where is the gun?

915
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:04,981
Why not on public display?
Why not in a glass case?

916
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:07,284
Why not in front of
thousands of people?

917
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,602
And after we found Colonel
Duttors body, anybody else...

918
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:25,538
<i>you, me, anybody else...</i>

919
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:27,973
We'd have gotten rid of that gun.

920
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:31,476
<i>We found the bullet in the victim...</i>

921
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:35,813
<i>and the ballistics check will</i>
<i>match up the bullet with the gun.</i>

922
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:41,516
But somehow, General,
something told me...

923
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,150
that you could never
get rid of that gun.

924
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:46,922
It meant too much to you.

925
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:49,429
You couldn't even
part with a cigarette lighter.

926
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:53,992
<i>No, that pearl-handled pistol</i>
<i>was just too tied up in your pride.</i>

927
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:58,768
Because of your tremendous
belief in yourself, you figured
everyone would accept your story...

928
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:00,832
about having a duplicate made.

929
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:07,509
But there never was a duplicate made,
was there?

930
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:16,451
This, in fact, is the murder weapon,
isn't it, General?

931
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:29,631
I assume Ballistics has
checked out the gun.

932
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:43,409
<i>That won't be necessary.</i>
All right, Lieutenant.

933
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:57,290
[Softly]
I'm sorry.

934
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,562
What is it with me, Lieutenant, huh?

935
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:31,224
I seem to have a special talent, you know?
I mean, with...

936
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,098
With all the men in the world,

937
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:37,138
I always seem to pick Mr. Wrong.

938
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,870
I'm seriously considering locking myself
in a closet for the rest of my life.

939
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,243
No. That's wrong.

940
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,909
That's just the way my niece,
Marilyn, felt after her divorce.

941
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:52,681
Now she's got a new husband.
As a matter of fact, he's a cop.

942
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:54,688
And they got six kids.

943
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:58,658
Lieutenant... I mean, just between us,
would you tell me the truth?

944
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:02,720
Do you really have a niece?
What kind of a question is that?
'Do I really have a niece?"

945
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:07,565
Well, do you?
Of course I've got a niece!
My wife's sister's girl, Cynthia.
