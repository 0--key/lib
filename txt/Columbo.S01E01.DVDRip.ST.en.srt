Oh, you're not

00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,700
Oh, come on, Ken.

6
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:23,037
You're forgetting that
I'm one half of the world's
greatest mystery writing team.

00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,670
You, uh, don't have gloves on,
your finger's not on the trigger,

You're right.
I'm a lousy practical joker.

What are you doing here
with that thing, anyway?

11
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,754
I was on my way down
to the cabin. I thought maybe
I could use it for protection.

12
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,317
Also came by to apologize.

- For blowing my cork the other day.
I got out of line.

Forget it.
You know, that happens.

15
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,598
Nah. Shouldn't happen.
Not between you and me.

16
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,699
So, believe it or not, sir,

Well, it's not really
a divorce.

Come on, Ken.

36
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:06,104
You're making me feel guilty.
All I want to do is write on my own.

37
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,813
You're right.
I am being selfish.

Okay, my boy.

I appreciate it.

After all, friendship is more important
than partnership. Right?

Here's to our friendship.

43
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,269
Right.

And now, sir,

45
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,036
I'm gonna kidnap you.

46
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,308
What?
The aforementioned cabin...

47
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,373
which has been finished
for over six months now...

48
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,509
You haven't seen it.
You're gonna be
my first male guest.

49
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,953
Oh, I can't, Ken. Not now.
Well, why can't you?

50
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,958
It's all the way down
in San Diego.
Oh, it's a couple of hours' drive.

51
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,960
I'll have you home
before midnight.

52
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,929

I'd take her to dinner
and a show.

53

Aw, that's easy. You pick up that phone,
you say, ' Honey, I'm gonna be working
late at the office tonight." Come on.

54

Soon as we get down there,
we uncork another bottle,

to unwind even for a day.
Oh, no, I'm not.

57
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,708
Well, then, prove it.
Come on. If you want
some justification,

you're doing it
as a favor for me.

59

At least give me a chance
to bury the hatchet
with some style, huh?

60

then turn down his invitation
all in one week, now do you?

You know, we ought to send
that broad some flowers.

64

Listen, I made a list of things
I'd like to take from the office.

65

You want to take
a look at it?

66
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,933
I don't get it.
It's a list of names.
Oh, I'm losing my mind.

67

Exactly.
That's why she'll believe you.

151
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,087
Yeah, well, I...
I just hate lying
to her. You know.

152
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,324
You're not lying to her.
You're saving her
a little anguish.

153
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,856
Now, will you pick up the phone
and call her so we can
start enjoying ourselves?

154
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,926
Okay.

155
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,278
- Oh, Operator, I'd like to
make a collect...
- Hold it.

156
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,741
It's a cinch you have never
cheated on Joanna before.

157
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,342
If you want your wife to believe
you're calling from the office,

158
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,252
you don't have the operator
place the call... you dial it direct.

159
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,882
The area code is 213.

160
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,841
Hi, honey.

161
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,606
How are ya?

162
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,614
Well, that's what
I'm calling about.

163
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,412
<i>Um, I'm at the office, and...</i>

164
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,509
<i>I'm pretty well into</i>
<i>this last chapter.</i>

165
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,681
I'd like to work straight through.
Yeah, I know.

166
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,054
<i>L... I know.</i>

167
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,925
This'll be the last time.
That I can...

168
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,521
<i>[Shot Fires]</i>
Jimmy?

169
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,533
Jimmy!

170
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:43,103
Operator, get me the police.

171
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,200
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

172
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,351
Hello. Joanna?

173
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,418
What?

174
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,629
Joanna...

175
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,828
Will you take it easy?
Now, say it again once more.

176
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,362
Are you sure?

177
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,566
Did you call the police?

178
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:49,580
Yes, yes, of course.
I'll leave right away.

179
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,412
Uh, Joanna, please.

180
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,475
Take it easy.

181
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,852
And don't worry.

182
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,723
I'm sure it's nothing
but a practical joke.

183
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,086
Good-bye.

184
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,187
No, I know it's insane.

185
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:35,158
And l-l-I just... I keep
thinking of the clichés and-and...

186
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,094
Jim and Ken
wrote this scene...

187
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,427
in their books a hundred times.

188
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,059
Look at it this way, Mrs. Ferris.
Maybe he isn't dead.

189
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,069
Now, there's no body,
no blood...

190
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,129
No! He was shot!
L-I know it!

191
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,266
L-l-I heard...
I heard it on the phone.

192
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,401
Are you sure
it was a gunshot?
This place was searched.

193
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,505
- Papers on the floor.
Have you any idea why?
- <i>No, I have no idea why.</i>

194
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,346
<i>Did you notice</i>
<i>anything special missing?</i>

195
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,581
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Are you sure it was his voice?</i>

196
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:06,420
<i>[Joanna]</i>
<i>Yes, I know it was his voice,</i>
<i>and maybe somebody...</i>

197
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,892
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Was he under any kind</i>
<i>of extra pressure?</i>

198
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,054
<i>[Joanna]</i>
<i>No. Maybe somebody was...</i>

199
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,655
- Did he say where he was calling from?
- Yes.

200
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,758
He said he was calling
from the office. He said... He said...

201
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,735
<i>"I'm calling from the office."</i>

202
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,295
<i>I really don't care</i>
<i>if anything was missing.</i>

203
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,501
<i>I just really want to find out</i>
<i>what happened to my husband.</i>

204
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,669
We'll do our best.
<i>You sure it was his voice?</i>

205
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,771
<i>I know it was his voice.</i>
Are you sure it was a gunshot?

206
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,476
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>
<i>[Man] Would you like to sit down</i>
<i>and get a glass of water?</i>

207
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,610
Yes, I would like...
Really, please.

208
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,779
'Cause I really feel stupid,

209
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,380
and I just really
want to clear my head.
<i>Get the water.</i>

210
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,449
Okay.

211
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,977
<i>[Columbo]</i>
<i>I think that's out of order, ma'am.</i>

212
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,412
Uh, you see, that's the trouble
with these buildings.
The fountains never work.

213
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,508
Then you have to use
the coffee machine.

214
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,452
And then you lose your dime
and the coffee's lousy.

215
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,183
Who are you?
Uh, I'm just another cop.

216
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,226
My name's Columbo.
I'm a lieutenant.

217
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,455
Were you in there...
I got the proof right here.

218
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:23,564
You didn't see me in there
because I left before you got in there.

219
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:28,368
And you know why?
Because it's so smoky in there
and so noisy in there...

220
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,567
that I just had to come outside
and get a breath.

221
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,008
Oh, I think I'd better get back.
Now, look.
Wait a minute.

222
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,808
Let me tell you something.
You look very tired to me,

223
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,282
and I think you had
a terrible experience in there.

224
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:43,014
And I think
I ought to drive you home.
Let's call it a night.

225
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,682
Well, don't you think
they want to ask me questions?

226
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:49,386
Oh, I don't think they'll mind.
I think you've answered
enough questions,

227
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,021
and I'll call them
and I'll tell them you're with me.

228
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,962
Okay?
Well, what about Ken?

229
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,193
Why isn't Ken here?

230
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,202
I don't know why he isn't here.

231
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,706
Is that Mr. Franklin,
the other half of the writing team?

232
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,968
[Chuckles]

233
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,442
Yeah, the other half
of the team.

234
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,338
You know, that's what I like
about these buttons.

235
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:14,078
You don't have to push 'em.
They go off with the heat
of your hand.

236
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,055
I bet you haven't had
anything to eat.

237
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:29,124
You're a very nice man, Lieutenant,
but I'm not really hungry.

238
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,160
I'll tell you, Mrs. Ferris,
I'm the worst cook in the world.

239
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,173
But there's one thing I do terrific,
and that's an omelet.

240
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,870
Even my wife admits it.
Uh, I need something for the eggshells.

241
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:43,176
- Over there in that cabinet.
- Right.

242
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,716
I'm really not hungry.
<i>Listen.</i>

243
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,412
You take a taste.
You don't like it,

244
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,421
you throw it away.

245
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,548
I'll tell you what the secret is
to a good omelet.

246
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:56,116
- No eggs. Just milk.
- [Stifled Chuckle]

247
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,358
- Uh, skillet.
- Over there.

248
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,097
You're a very persuasive man,
Lieutenant.

249
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,467
Maybe I should hold up my end
and make the coffee.

250
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:20,151
I need cheese and onions
and, uh, butter.

251
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:24,087
Cheese... Uh, I need something
to grate the cheese.

252
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,351
Over there in the cupboard.

253
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,416
Right.

254
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,068
What did they do with him,
Lieutenant?

255
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,696
I don't know, ma'am.

256
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:46,073
<i>Well, there was no body in the office.</i>
<i>Couldn't that mean that he isn't dead?</i>

257
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,443
Well, that's hard to say.
Uh, it's bothering me too.

258
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,108
I tell ya, the whole thing
doesn't make sense
unless it's a kidnapping.

259
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,642
Well, you don't shoot
a victim first, do you?

260
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,349
Why'd you laugh before?
When?

261
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,086
When I asked you if Mr. Franklin was
the other half of the writing team.

262
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,822
Did I laugh?
Yep.

263
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,887
Maybe it was the way you put it.

264
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,160
'Writing team."

265
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,293
Maybe I shouldn't say it,

266
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,204
but Ken hasn't written a word
of a Mrs. Melville novel in years.

267
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,674
Mrs. Melville?
Who's Mrs. Melville?

268
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,303
The character
thatJim and Ken created.

269
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,212
The one who solves
all the crimes brilliantly.

270
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,376
Well, uh, why did your husband
put up with it?

271
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,477
What I mean is, uh,
him doing all the work.

272
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,216
Well, there were compensations.

273
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,852
Ken did the publicity,
went on all the talk shows,

274
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:40,557
and he did interviews
and cultivated the film people.

275
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,123
He contributed.

276
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,135
He just didn't do
any of the writing.

277
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,330
Boy, I'll tell ya,
I'd love to be a writer.

278
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,340
That's a terrific talent.

279
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,569
Where did he get
all the ideas?

280
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,770
Oh, from almost anything.

281
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,678
People. Magazines.

282
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,376
Conversations.

283
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:03,410
I'm constantly finding
scraps of paper
and old matchbook covers...

284
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,548
just all over the house
with notes and ideas.

285
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,253
And those were mysteries, too,
werert they, huh?

286
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,558
Mm-hmm.
They're tricky.
I'll tell you that.

287
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,689
I could never
figure those things out.

288
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,165
Well, it got harder.

289
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,794
Maybe that's why he decided
to go out on his own.

290
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,499
Oh, really? I didn't know that.
I guess he wanted to do
some serious work.

291
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,701
No kidding?

292
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:28,371
How did Mr. Franklin take that?

293
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,439
Not very well.

294
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,076
But he'll get over it.

295
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,985
Gee, I'd hate to be in his shoes.
Why?

296
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,991
Well, you got a writing team, and they're
very famous, and now they break up,
and what happens?

297
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,426
One fella continues writing books,
and the other fella just stops.

298
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,624
Yeah. That's what
I keep telling Jim...

299
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,191
that sooner or later,
people are bound to find out.

300
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,737
What, that your husband
did all the writing?
Mmm.

301
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,603
Yeah.

302
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,303
Kind of tough
on Mr. Franklirs ego.

Jo.

305
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,109
I know, I know.
Just take it easy.

306
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,613
I drove up here

No, not yet.

308

Jo, it's incredible.

309
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,913
I just saw him
this morning at the office.

310
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,117
Oh, I'm sorry, Ken.
Uh,

311
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,093
Lieutenant Columbo,
Mr. Franklin.

312
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,529
How you doir?
No, the question is,
how you doing, Lieutenant?

313
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,998
Well, I'm afraid
we just got started.

314
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,436
Has Jim been found yet?

315
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,802
Has he been found yet?
Uh...

316
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,864
Why? Did somebody tell you
he was gone?

317
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,343
Lieutenant, I just spent several hours
driving up here from San Diego.

318
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,812
You must know that this story
is on every news station.

319
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,873
Oh, right. Yeah.
Gee, I should have thought of that.

320
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,182
Well, has he been found?
Gee, I'm afraid not.

321
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,848
No. Were you visiting friends
in San Diego?

322
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,724
He has a place there... a cabin.
Oh, away for the weekend.
Gee, that's nice.

323
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,024
Mmm. Could we get back
to my question?

324
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,030
Have you come up with
any leads, any clues?

325
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,534
Uh, it's a little early for that.
<i>Early?</i>

326
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:34,038
Seems to me your men are
standing around just marking time.

327
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,039
Could I have a drink, love?

328
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,667
I could use one myself.
Thanks.

329
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,980
I'll tell you something,
Lieutenant.

330
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,484
<i>See, if Mrs. Melville</i>
<i>were on this case,</i>

331
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,985
oh, she'd be leaps and bounds
ahead of you by now.

332
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,852
Is that the lady in the books?
<i>That's right.</i>

333
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,425
You see, she would have
figured out that this is not
just someone missing.

334
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,727
This is a professional killing.

335
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,438
Aha. Here it is.

336
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,571
Take a look at that.
Uh, put it on the desk.

337
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,378
Just drop it. 'Cause of
the fingerprints, you know.

338
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,249
Jim's fingerprints
are all over that.
So are mine.

339
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:29,086
What is it?
What's it look like?
It's a list of names.

340
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,824
Look at that. Mustel,
Delgado, Hathaway, Westlake...

341
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,062
Sound familiar?
Uh, yeah, kinda.

342
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:41,629
Well, they should. That's a list
of some of the top men
in organized crime on the West Coast...

343
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,005
L.A., Vegas, Frisco...
I don't understand.

344
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,374
Well, it's painfully obvious.

345
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,743
One of these men
had Jim killed.

346
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,544
Really? Why?

347
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:56,178
Tell me something.
How long have you been
a lieutenant, Lieutenant?

348
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,848
Mrs. Melville would have
put that together like that.
[Snaps Fingers]

349
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:02,553
Look, I... I'm willing to take
all the help I can get.

350
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,562
All right. Let me see
if I can explain it to you.

351
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,656
See, my partner and I
decided to split,
go our separate ways.

352
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,667
I'm sureJoanna must have
mentioned that to you.

353
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,828
Yeah, she said
something about that.

354
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:17,568
Did she also mention the fact
thatJim wanted to do
some serious writing?

355
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,974
Hey.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

356
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,605
Wait a minute. Yeah!
Dawning on you now?
I knew you'd get it.

357
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,115
But that's only
the tip of the iceberg.

358
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:28,619
You see, Jim was researching
a complete and factual exposé...

359
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,655
of all West Coast organized crime.

360
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,748
I mean, he was going around asking
some pretty embarrassing questions.

361
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,293
<i>Probing.</i>
<i>Compiling dossiers.</i>

362
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,295
<i>That's why</i>
<i>they searched this office.</i>

363
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,127
Apparently, they got everything
but that list.

364
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,259
And you think one of these fellas
put out a contract on him.

365
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,737
Of course. Word must have gotten around
thatJim was compiling all this information.

366
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,366
They knew they couldn't buy him off,
so what do they do?

367
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,502
<i>They chose the usual</i>
<i>alternative.</i>

368
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:57,947
Professional killing, huh?
But if that's true,
why did they get rid of the body?

369
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:03,380
Well, who knows?
But remember one thing...
Without a corpus delicti,

370
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,685
you can't prove a murder
was committed in the first place.

371
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,191
But why would
a professional killer care?

372
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,955
I mean, he's already on a plane
back from where he came.

373
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:15,489
Lieutenant, I can't answer
all your questions. I've given you
a list of the most likely suspects.

374
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,297
A clear motive.
Isn't that enough to start with?

375
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,830
Oh, that's plenty.
And believe me, I'm very grateful
for all the help you've given me.

376
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,338
Gee, that's funny.
What?

377
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:33,748
Well, this thing is folded lengthwise,
like someone was carrying it
in their pocket.

378
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,809
So?

379
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,889
Well, if he typed that
on that typewriter...

380
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,084
and I'll run a check on that...

381
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,684
why would he fold it up
before he put it in that drawer?

382
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,724
[Chuckling]
I'm beginning to like you.

383
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,997
Why is that?
Because you're finally beginning
to think like Mrs. Melville.

384
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,331
Unfortunately, Jim used to
fold up a piece of paper,

385
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,501
and he'd use it
as a bookmark, you know.
Ah.

386
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,840
Now, however interesting
your observation is,

387
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,540
it only leads us far astray.

388
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:08,518
However,
since you are beginning to learn
how to emulate our dear lady,

389
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,054
I'm gonna give you something
that you richly deserve...

390
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,249
a chance to read
some of our books.

391
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,989
Well, that's very nice of you.
Didn't expect gifts tonight, huh?

392
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,895
Thank you. Maybe I can
pick up a few pointers.

393
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,898
Oh, I'm sure you can.

394
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,264
Uh, could you handle
some more?
Oh, all right.

395
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,736
Here you go.
Oh, and an extra.
Oh, that's very nice.

396
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,468
That ought to keep you busy
for a while, huh?
Yeah, it sure will.

397
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,534
Well, anything else, Lieutenant?
Uh, no, I don't think so.

398
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,375
I think I'd better let you
get some sleep.
Oh, that's very nice of you.

399
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,315
I just only hope
I was of some help.
Oh, you certainly were.

400
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,217
Well, good night, Lieutenant.
Good night, sir.
Good night.

401
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,222
Oh, Mr. Franklin. Uh...

402
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,918
Actually, uh, there is one thing,

403
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,222
not that it makes
that much difference.

404
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,229
What is it?

405
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,697
When Mrs. Ferris called you
and told you her husband got shot,

406
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,961
you jumped in a car and drove
right back to L.A.

407
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,731
Is that right?
That's right.

408
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,398
You know, me,
I'd have taken a plane.

409
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:06,069
I mean, it's a big airport,
and they run every half hour.
It'd been a lot faster.

410
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:12,344
Well, I... That's true,
but in a situation like that,
who thinks clearly?

411
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:17,184
And look at it this way.
You add up all the time it takes
to drive to and from an airport,

412
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,189
how much time
do you really save?

413
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,461
Hmm.

00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:23,238
What? No comment.

446
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,641
Aw, you've gotta be kidding.
You want an interview now?

447
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:33,749
A gentleman of the press.
<i>Afraid you're gonna get</i>
<i>a lot of that.</i>

448
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:39,114
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I'm forgetting my manners.
Would you like a drink?

449
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,284
<i>Yeah. Mmm.</i>
<i>Maybe a drop ofbourbon.</i>

450
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,351
Bourbon.

451
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,960
Boy, this is quite a place.

452
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,160
This a copy?

453
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,226
<i>Hardly.</i>
<i>It's an original.</i>

454
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,635
Gee, I thought they only
hung this stuff on museums.

455
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,642
<i>You own this?</i>

456
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,076
Mrs. Melville has been very kind.

457
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,247
Boy. Quite a place.

458
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:09,878
Gee whiz. And you got
that other place in San Diego.

459
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:13,321
Gee, the upkeep alone must be...

460
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,621
I manage to scrape by.
Your drink.

461
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,787
Thank you. You know,
there's one thing about writers
that I don't understand.

462
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,797
Maybe you can help me
clear it up.

463
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,992
If a fella's partner dies,

464
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:27,436
uh, does he own the other
fella's half of the books,
half of the, uh, um...

465
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,439
Royalties?
Yeah.

466
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,738
No. They go
into the deceased's estate.

467
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,177
Mmm. That leaves you
out in the cold, doesn't it?

468
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,909
Unless, of course,
you insured each other.

469
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:42,214
Lieutenant, aren't we going
a bit far astray?

470
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,550
You're right. We shouldn't
be talking about this now.

471
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,556
It's not the time.

472
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,092
Uh... Uh...

473
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,288
So, Mr. Franklin, tell me, uh,

474
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:56,857
why do you think that they left
your partner's body out there
on the lawn like that?

475
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,664
Do you mean to tell me
you haven't figured that out?

476
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,069
Lieutenant,
you disappoint me.

477
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,801
It was left as a warning.
A warning?

478
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,243
Of course.

479
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:12,646
It also proves my theory about
it being a professional killing.

480
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:17,120
See, the moment they dropped
Jim's body in the middle
of that lawn...

481
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,816
<i>Please, sit down.</i>

482
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,950
<i>You know</i>
<i>what they were saying?</i>

483
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:24,494
That this could happen to you...

484
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,757
unless you stop
in your partner's research.

485
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,823
- They're trying to scare you.
- Exactly.

486
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,892
Right.

487
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:35,063
So what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna continue
writing the book anyway?

488
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:40,133
No, that's the irony of it.
You see, that was Jim's
pet project, not mine.

489
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,805
[Chuckles]
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

490
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,748
Say, I guess they didn't have
any way of knowing
you two were gonna split up.

491
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:51,448
Nah. Even if they did,
it wouldn't have doneJim any good.

492
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,923
<i>I must say, Lieutenant,</i>
<i>you're up against a dead end.</i>

493
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,586
Look at this.
You got a body,

494
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,789
you got a motive,

495
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,355
but you're never
gonna find that killer.

496
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,901
It's not gonna be easy.

497
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,938
I'll lay you 5 to <i>1
it was someone
in Las Vegas or Miami.

498
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:12,772
Picked up a phone and...
pfft! ...put out a contract.
Right. Right.

499
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,940
How you're gonna make a case,
much less solve one,
is beyond me.

500
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:21,474
I know. I guess the only thing
I can do is... just check out
every name on that list.

501
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:25,750
Sure. You know what's gonna
happen? Every one of those guys
is gonna deny thatJim even existed.

502
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,757
Right.

503
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,692
I must say
I don't envy you.
I don't envy myself.

504
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:33,889
Now, look. I got a lot
of phone calls to make.
I'd better get on it, huh?

505
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:38,061
All the luck.
Thanks. Thanks a lot,
Mr. Franklin.

506
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,536
And listen. I'm very sorry
about what happened tonight.

507
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,596
Thank you.
Right.

508
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,845
You, uh...

509
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:52,576
<i>You will keep me posted,</i>
<i>Lieutenant?</i>
Oh, yes, I will. Yeah.

510
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,948
You know, there's only one thing
that I'm not clear about.

511
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,078
But that can wait.
You want to go to bed.

512
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:02,385
Lieutenant, I'm not gonna
get any sleep anyway.
What is it?

513
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,122
Would you go over for me
once again... I know you did it...

514
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,165
exactly what happened
when you came home tonight?

515
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,497
Sure. L...
I've already told you, but...

516
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,936
[Sighs]
The moment I saw Jim's body
in the middle of the lawn,

517
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,668
I came running in here
and I picked up the phone
and I called you.

518
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,939
I mean, it's a purely
reflexive action.

519
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,071
Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh.

520
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:26,514
Uh-huh. That's fine.
Now, wait a minute.
You look like you're troubled.

521
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,018
Is there some reason
for your question?

522
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,919
Uh, it's your mail.

523
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,787
My mail?
Isn't it funny
how people are different?

524
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:39,057
Now, me, if I found my partner dead,
I'd never think of opening my letters.

525
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,797
But I-I... I just did it
to distract myself.

526
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:48,202
I mean, you got to remember
one thing, that's a great shock.

527
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:51,435
Yeah.
Oh, that's understandable.

528
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,945
And bills are distracting.
Listen, if anything comes up,

529
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,037
I'll call you right away.

530
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,776
Good night.
Good night.

531
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,990
I'm gonna have a hot dog.
I guess I will too.

532
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,141
No, no, Mr. Tucker.
You put that away.

533
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,200
This one's on me.

534
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,406
May I have a receipt, please?

535
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,648
All right, Lieutenant.
You're bribing me
with a handsome lunch.

536
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,122
What can I do for you?
Uh, this is about
an insurance policy.

537
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,751
Oh, excellent.
It's about time you came to me.

538
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,227
I can give you
a package within your...
Yeah, this is, uh,

539
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,423
an insurance policy
that was already written.

540
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:53,093
Oh, this is official business.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, there are two mystery writers...

541
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,333
Ken Franklin and James Ferris.

542
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,069
Your company
wrote a policy on them?
Now, wait a minute, Lieutenant.

543
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,771
We like to cooperate
with the police, but...

544
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:05,043
if you want confidential information,
I'm afraid that you...
Oh, well, look, uh,

545
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,050
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

546
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,552
Maybe it'll be more helpful
if I got a court order?

547
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,586

[Chattering Continues]

549
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:33,973
Oh, Ken, it was simply marvelous.
I was terrified.

550
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:38,709
Oh, really?
I had the whole thing figured out
by the end of the first act.

551
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,343
Oh, you did?
I was completely fooled.

552
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:45,446
You must have a devious mind.
No, dear,
it's because you're young.

553
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:48,083
Always remember
one thing, my love.

554
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,423
The moment
a man mentions a long-lost twin,

555
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:54,555
you can inevitably know that it's
going to be some impersonation.

556
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,362
It's an old plot trick.

557
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:01,371
Mr. Franklin! Yoo-hoo!

558
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:06,604
- Over here!
- Who's that?

559
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,475
Someone
that should be somewhere else.

560
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,913
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>No, we go this way.</i>
Excuse me a moment.

561
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:18,446
Miss La Sanka,
what a pleasant surprise.
Hi. [Giggling]

562
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:22,652
What brings you to the big city?
Oh, I came in to do
a little shopping.

563
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,786
You... You like my dress?
Oh, it's lovely.

564
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,729
See a play.
[Laughs]

565
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,164
She's a beauty,
Mr. Franklin.

566
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,361
<i>Yes, she is.</i>
<i>Uh, thank you.</i>

567
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,631
I haven't seen her before
have I?

568
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,832
No, I don't believe you have.

569
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,808
Well, it's...
it's lovely to see you.
I, uh,

570
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,345
hope you won't think
I'm being forward,
[Chuckles]

571
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:46,349
But is there any chance of, uh,
our having a drink together?

572
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,351
Oh, I'd... I'd love to, really.
But, uh...

573
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,785
See, the young lady and I
are going to have a late supper.

574
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,120
I think you might want to cancel it.

575
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,193
- Just why would I want to do that?
- Because...

576
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:03,961
we really should have a discussion.
[Chuckles]

577
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,564
Perhaps some other time.
All right. L...

578
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,666
I suppose I'll have to find
someone else to tell my story to.
[Chuckles]

579
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,337
It's a mystery story.

580
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,608
Very interesting.
Really.

581
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:22,482
It's all about this witness.
[Chuckles]

582
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,989
Just wait here.
I'll be right back.

583
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:30,424

592
00:40:56,754 --> 00:41:00,656
That's quite a stare.
I'm sorry.
L-I can't help it.

593
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,885
You know,
I've never seen you outside
that store before.

594
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,588
You're very lovely.

595
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:10,293
May I call you Lili?
Yes, please do.
[Giggles]

596
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:17,634
How did you enjoy
the play tonight?
Oh, I thought
it was predictable. You?

597
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:22,304
Oh, I like your books
much more.
That's very flattering.

598
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,813
But you said something before
about, uh,

599
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,373
about your story
or something about a...
a witness.

600
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:31,444
Oh, yes. Well, actually,

601
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:35,083
it's a, uh,
true-to-life story.

602
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,457
Oh, the best kind.
[Giggles]

603
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,895
It concerns your partner.
Jim?

604
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,490
Uh-huh.
What about him?

605
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:47,025
Well, I read in the papers
about his death,

606
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,130
and I felt just terrible.
Thank you.

607
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:55,543
I felt just terrible, because they said
he was killed in his office.

608
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,377
So they did.
Well,

609
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,009
in my story, you see,

610
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,645
he couldn't have actually
been killed in an office,

611
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:07,122
because he was, uh,

612
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,182
somewhere else.

613
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,628
Just for a moment,
let's forget about your story,

614
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,028
and let's, uh...
let's talk about real life.

615
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:20,628
[Chuckles]
It is simpler, isn't it?
Much.

616
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,070
I'll tell you honestly, Ken.

617
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,634
I was very confused
when I saw the papers,
because,

618
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:32,148
when you were in my store
making a phone call the other day,
Uh-huh.

619
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,549
I wandered over
to the side window to see...

620
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,486
if you had brought a lady with you.
[Giggles]

621
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:42,322
You didn't believe me when I said
that I was alone.
Oh, I believed you.
It's just that...

622
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,888
I'm very interested in you, Ken.

623
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:52,165
[Giggles]
Well, anyway,

624
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,205
you can imagine my surprise
when I saw your partner.

625
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,797
There he was, big as life,

626
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,242
sitting there
in the front seat of your car.

627
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:05,248
And that disturbed you, huh?
Oh, not at that time.

628
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,474
Only later.

629
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,747
And then I debated
with myself for days...

630
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:13,585
whether to come
and see you or not.

631
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:19,422
Why didn't you go to the police?
Oh, Ken.

632
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:22,488
I wouldn't want
to get you into trouble.
[Giggling]

633
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:26,263
Of course not.
[Snorting Chuckle]
All right, Lili. How much?

634
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,431
[Laughs]
I hope you don't think that
that's the on...

635
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:31,633
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't think anything.

636
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:36,078
I'll tell you something.
I'm most grateful you came to me first.

637
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:41,914
Know why?
Because I think we can reach
an equitable agreement.

638
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,648
I do so admire your candor.

639
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:49,587
This isn't easy for me...
a widow running a...

640
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,494
small country store,
trying to make ends meet.
Oh, I can understand that.

641
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:57,466
And I also recognize in you
a woman of... of some breeding.

642
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:01,470
I mean, you're not just
a common... blackmailer.

643
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,336
I'm so glad you're understanding.

644
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,968
Very well, Lili.

645
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,478
How much for your silence?

646
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,215
$15,000? L...
<i>[Plate Clattering]</i>

647
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,687
Oh! L-I know it's a lot,
but that's all I'll ever ask for.
Honestly.

648
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:23,625
- And I'm a woman of my word!
- I know you are, and I respect you for that.

649
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,628
And you know what?

650
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:30,156
In that spirit, I accept your terms.
Agreed?

651
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:33,533
[Relieved Chuckle]
Agreed.

652
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:37,438
[Chuckles]
And I know you won't take offense
when I say,

653
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,499
'It's a pleasure
doing business with you."

654
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:44,673
No, no. My pleasure.

00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,956
He's occupied at the moment.
Who shall I say is calling?

659
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,695
Uh, Lt. Columbo.
Oh. Well, won't you

<i>Fire away.</i>

664
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,963
After all, your magazine
was very kind to Franklin and Ferris
during our lean years.

665
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:39,799
That's, uh, the second reason
I granted the interview.
Oh? What was the first?

00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:44,398
- Why, the charm
of the interviewer, of course.

Yes, Lieutenant.
Is there something I can do for you?

Oh, yeah. If-lf you...

<i>Uh, just one last question.</i>

674
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:14,070
I think our readers will want to know
how the death of your partner will affect
the Mrs. Melville books.

675
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,630
I'm afraid when I buried Jim
I buried Mrs. Melville with him.

676
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,108
Mmm, I understand.

677
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:23,305
But everyone will miss her so.
Can't you write another one?

678
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,076
Oh, I could, naturally,
but what's the point?

679
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,813
With Jim gone, there...
[Smacks Lips]
Wouldn't be much reason.

680
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:34,551
No, I'm afraid, uh,
Mrs. Melville has solved
her last case.

681
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:39,426
Actually, I've been...
seriously debating as to whether
I would ever want to write again.

682
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:43,023
Oh, well, I hope you do.
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.

Now, if you don't mind, huh?
Of course.
Let's go Harvey.

684
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:52,134
Perhaps,
under better circumstances,
I, uh...

685
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:56,578
less harassed circumstances...
I could give you a more detailed interview.

686
00:46:57,714 --> 00:47:00,945
- Even in more depth.
- <i>Mmm, that'll be nice.</i>

687
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:05,216
Shall I call you?
Yes. Please do.
Next week, huh?

688
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,591
Good-bye.

689
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:14,196
Oh, sorry, Harvey.
Thanks, very much.
Thank you.

690
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,733
All right, Lieutenant.
What can I do for you?

691
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,836
Well, I brought back your books.

692
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:32,780
<i>Well, that's fine.</i>
<i>Just put 'em over there</i>
<i>on the table.</i>

00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,479
Yeah. Uh, sure.
I wanted to tell ya how much
I enjoyed 'em.

What a character, what a brain.

697
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,266
<i>And what logic!</i>
<i>The way she figures it out!</i>
Lieutenant.

698
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:54,236
I'd love to sit down
and discuss literature with you,
but I was on my way out.

699
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,772
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

700
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,468
I didn't mean to bother ya.
Uh, you goir someplace special?

701
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,842
Yes, as a matter of fact.
I'm on my way down to my cabin
for a rest.

702
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:06,144
- Would you like an itinerary?
- Hey, I'm sorry.

703
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,276
- I'm makir a pest of myself.
- No.

704
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:12,948
Yes, yes, I am.
I know, it's because I keep
askir these questions.

705
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:16,083
But I'll tell ya.
I can't help myself.

706
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,094
It's a habit.
I take it you're not goir alone.

707
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,661
- Whatever gave that idea?
- I noticed the two bottles of champagne.

708
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,368
Oh, those. Oh, I'm quite capable
of drinking those two bottles...

709
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,497
and a good deal more
without any help.

710
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,907
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Lieutenant.

711
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,946
Yeah. Uh, listen.
Unless you just wanna take a second...

712
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:40,211
to know how we're progressir
on your partner's list.

713
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,914
Oh?
Anything concrete?

714
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:47,445
No, not a thing.
Just like you predicted.

715
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:49,958
Everyone said
they never even heard ofJames Ferris.

716
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:52,461
[Smacks Lips]
That's just as I expected.

717
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:56,397
Well, it was lovely to chat with you,
Lieutenant.

718
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,901
Oh, Mr. Franklin?
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.

719
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,743
Is it important?
Well, it could be.
You see, I was checking the, uh,

720
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:13,374
the phone company records
in San Diego.

721
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:18,113
Now, why would you want
to do that, Lieutenant?

722
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:22,318
Oh, well, I have to do that.
You know, that's part of my job.
I got to tie up all those loose ends.

723
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,451
Anyway,
on the day of the murder...

724
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:27,395
there was a record
of a call from the cabin.

725
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:31,195
It was a call to the Ferris house
in Los Angeles.

726
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:35,068
I see.
And now you're wondering whether
I can explain that. Is that right?

727
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,107
Oh, I'm sure you can.
Oh, you're right. I can.

728
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,541
But, you see, you would've saved
both you and me a great deal of trouble...

729
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,942
if you'd checked
with Joanna Ferris first.

730
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,504
She would've explained to you
that I'd spoken with her from my cabin,

731
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:49,109
telling her thatJim and I had
patched up our differences.

732
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,120
Oh, what do you mean
by ' differences"? Uh...

733

- It means that he knew her.

It means that he knew her
not casually, the way he said.

It means that he knew her

By itself,
it doesn't prove anything.

that Franklin committed these crimes,

Ken has an alibi.

932
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,346
What's his motive?

01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,685
I told ya how he could've
worked the phone.

934
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:05,022
Now, his motive
is the insurance money.
He needed cash.

935
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:07,892
He spent money like a drunken sailor.
He had two houses.

936
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:11,092
He's got paintings.
He's got women.

937
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,101
He's got...

938
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:16,367
What?

939
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,799

Oh.

944
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:46,131
Lieutenant,
if Ken killed my husband,

945
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:49,569
then why did he murder
Miss La Sanka?

946
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:51,629
Well, it's my hunch
that she knew something.

947
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:54,540
Maybe she saw them together,
and she tried to blackmail him.

948
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:58,444
But that's pure guesswork, isn't it?
No, ma'am, it's not.
Not quite.

949
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:02,177
I checked the bank.
Yesterday, he took out $15,000.

950
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:05,448
Today, he put it back in again.

951
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,921
Now, why in the world
would he do that?

952
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:14,088
All right.
I'm still not convinced, but...

953
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,757
let's say I'll go along.

954
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,060
What happens now?
I don't know.

955
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:24,732
But I've got a pretty strong
circumstantial case.
It's just not enough.

956
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:28,641
If I had one piece of hard evidence,
I could nail this fella.

957
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:34,478
But you don't.
That's right, ma'am. I don't.
That's why I'm here.

958
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,519
Maybe
you can give it to me.
Me?

959
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:41,249
You knew both of these fellas very well.
I want you to tell me about 'em.

960
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:45,419
Anything. Just talk...
whatever comes into your mind.

961
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:49,021

01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:37,153
Not with the witness,
'cause you killed the witness.
But I got another way to prove it.

1019
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:42,528
Well, you enlighten me.
I must say, I enjoy watching a man raise
without any cards in his hand.

1020
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:45,795
You know what, Ken?
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

1021
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,632
For a while there,
I never thought I was gonna get you.

1022
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:51,673
Believe me,
you had me goir in such circles.

1023
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:55,471
I couldn't figure it out.
Suddenly, I thought of something...

1024
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,944
how clever that first murder was...

1025
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:00,846
the phone gimmick,
working late in the office.

1026
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,578
<i>Brilliant.</i>
Oh, are you awarding gold medals today?

1027
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:08,487
Yes! For the first one,
not for the second one.
That was sloppy.

1028
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,855
Mrs. Melville,
she'd have been very disappointed.

1029
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:13,053
<i>Oh, come on, get</i>
<i>to the climax, Lieutenant.</i>

1030
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:16,791
You're talking to a writer.
<i>Am I?</i>
<i>That's not what I heard.</i>

1031
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:20,266
And that's the key:
That you're not a writer.

1032
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:23,737
When Mrs. Ferris told me
that you didn't contribute to the writing,

1033
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,797
that her husband did all the work,

1034
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:29,742
That's a lie.
I had to say to myself,

1035
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:33,908
'How could a man
with no talent for mysteries
make up such a clever murder?"

1036
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:37,440
<i>If you were that ingenious,</i>
<i>you'd be able to write your own books.</i>

1037
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:42,323
Go ahead. I'm fascinated,
as boring as it may be.

1038
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:44,416
Then I got it.

1039
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:48,452
The first one... the clever one...
that wasn't yours.

1040
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:52,899
The second one...
the sloppy one... that was yours.

1041
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:56,369
- But not the first.
- Oh?

1042
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:59,566
And whose idea was that, then?

1043
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:02,576
Your partner's. Had to be.

1044
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:05,044
And his wife told me
how conscientious he was.

1045
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:09,847
You know, the way he used to write down
his ideas on every odd scrap of paper,
backs of matches, whatever...

1046
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:12,910
Ahh, ah. So that's why
you wouldn't let the movers in.

1047
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:16,719
Well, I had to rummage around here
before they emptied everything out.

1048
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,717
Is this
your partner's handwriting?

1049
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:24,789
Well, I think I can prove it is.
Maybe I ought to read this to ya.

1050
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:28,564
'Idea for a Melville book...
perfect alibi.

1051
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:32,539
"A ' wants to kill 'B.'
Drives 'B ' to a remote house...

1052
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,633
'and has him call his wife in city.

1053
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:39,147
Tells her he's working late
at the office. Bang, bang."

1054
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:45,019
Sound familiar?
That's the part you used,

1055
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,715
practically word-for-word.

1056
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,781
Should I read some more?

1057
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:53,885
No.
<i>[Door Opening, Closing]</i>
Officer.

1058
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:57,420
With this, I think I got
a conviction, don't you?

1059
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:04,837
You got to admit I had you goir
for awhile though, didn't I?

1060
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:07,341
Yes, you did.

1061
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:11,641
[Snickers]
You wanna know the irony
of all of this?

1062
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:15,080
That <i>is</i> my idea,

1063
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,641
the only really good one
I ever had.

1064
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:20,688
I must've told it toJim
over five years ago.

1065
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:22,690
[Chuckles]

1066
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:26,889
Whoever thought that idiot
would write it down?
