It's a clean bill of health.

- You sure?
- Well, I'm not in the habit

Yes. I'm sorry, of course.

But lately it's been like
waiting for a biopsy report...

38

Well, in this case, benign.

I don't know which I feel most,
relief or anger.

But I suppose when one marries

one tends to become
a little paranoid.

Well, that's correct,
Mrs. Kennicutt.

62

I even went so far
as to falsify the report.

A stupid mistake.

In your case,
10 years of marriage...

and one brief indiscretion.

80
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:55,080
So, why not bend the truth
a little bit?

Uh, then you're
not going to tell him?

For example,
at the moment I'm working on case...

to have certain information
about a federal judge

230
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:36,185
Well, don't bother.
Lenore was faithful to me in every way.

did she play?

239
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,616
Oh, tennis. She was also
very fond of skin diving.

240
00:22:06,688 --> 00:22:11,318
Yes. Uh, did she do this with you, sir?
Did she do it with friends?

With friends, Lieutenant.

Good morning, sir.

258
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:45,945
Would you like some coffee,
some juice?
Uh, nothing for me.

259
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,079
No. Thank you very much.
Any progress?

260
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:52,422
Uh, no, sir.
I hate to admit this,
but, uh, nothing.

261
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:55,428
Not a single lead?
No, sir. Nothing.

262
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:58,431
Well, uh... Well,
some of my associates think...

All right. Be right in.

271
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,025
Why?
Well, her behavior seems
a little strange, sir.

272
00:24:29,097 --> 00:24:33,397
Uh, she went out to the beach house
in the middle of the week,
which is unusual.

273
00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:38,201
And, uh, she said to the caretaker
she had some thinking to do...

274
00:24:38,272 --> 00:24:40,570
and then she went for a walk.

275
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:43,804
And then the next morning her body
was found on the other side of town.

276
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:48,038
What are you getting at?

277
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:50,050
I wish I knew.
I don't know.

278
00:24:50,118 --> 00:24:54,020
It's just that it sounds to me
like a woman that has a problem.

279
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:58,650
Now, did your wife
have any personal problems?
My wife was a very happy woman.

280
00:24:58,726 --> 00:25:01,194
Uh-huh. Yeah, well,

281
00:25:01,262 --> 00:25:03,196
it's just that
if she did have a problem,

282
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:05,926
I thought that maybe it would be
connected with the murder.

283
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,594
But you've no proof of that.
Oh, no, sir. No.

284

Lieutenant, I call the City Room
every half hour to find out
what you people are doing.

So far, not a word.

No arrest...
not even a promise of one.

287
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:23,445
Now you tell me
you haven't a lead.

288
00:25:23,518 --> 00:25:27,318
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Kennicutt.
Uh, looks like it's gonna be slow.

289
00:25:27,388 --> 00:25:29,322
It doesn't have to be.

00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:51,175
You've heard of
Brimmer Associates?
Uh, no, I haven't.

294
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:54,009
Well, it's security
and investigations,
Lieutenant.

295
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:56,242
You might say you and I
are in the same business.

296
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:58,751
Oh, really?
Matter of fact,
I was talking about you just last night.

297
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:01,185
I ran into the commissioner
at a party.

298
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:03,189
He speaks
very highly of you.

299
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:06,852
Naturally, you're wondering
why Mr. Brimmer's here.

300
00:26:06,928 --> 00:26:09,863
Now, please don't take this
as a reflection on you,

301
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:12,195
but I've engaged his firm
to work on the case.

302
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:17,135
Well, now, Arthur,
I'm here in an advisory capacity...
a supplemental capacity only.

303
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:19,696
I don't want
the lieutenant to get the idea
that I'm competing with him.

304
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:23,767
Uh, but there's no reason
why a private agency
and a public one...

305
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:27,371
can't cooperate,
is there?
No.

306
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:30,713
You see,
I want as much coverage
in this case as possible.

307
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:33,276
And when Mr. Brimmer called
and offered his services,

308
00:26:33,354 --> 00:26:35,379
I thought it was an excellent idea.

309
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:38,050
Sure, uh,
I can understand that.

310
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,821
Uh, you two know
each other?

311
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:42,886
Well, Mr. Brimmer's done
some work for me.

312
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:44,989
I see. I see.
[Clears Throat]

313
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:47,466
Some kind of security work?
Guards for the paper?

314
00:26:47,535 --> 00:26:50,561
Oh, it was a personal matter.
The point is, Lieutenant,

315
00:26:50,638 --> 00:26:54,233
I told Arthur on the phone
I couldn't imagine you wouldn't
accept a helping hand...

316
00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:57,072
considering the manpower shortage
in your department.

317
00:26:57,144 --> 00:27:00,079
<i>You see, Mr. Brimmer</i>
<i>used to be a police officer himself.</i>

318
00:27:00,147 --> 00:27:02,809
[Brimmer]
Well, it was a long time ago.

319
00:27:02,883 --> 00:27:05,909
But at least I can understand
your problems, Lieutenant.

320
00:27:05,987 --> 00:27:11,357
Well, now, listen,
I said to Mr. Kennicutt I'm grateful
for all the help I can get.

321
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:14,019
I'm just not sure
how my superior's gonna take this.

322
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:15,960
That's already been taken care of.

323
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:20,797
<i>It's just that Mr. Kennicutt is anxious</i>
<i>for a quick resolution to the case.</i>
<i>You can understand that.</i>

324
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:22,927
Well, naturally.
<i>[Brimmer]</i>
<i>Well, good.</i>

325
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:26,098
I hope the association
will be beneficial to you.

326
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:28,835
Oh, I'm sure it will. Yeah.

327
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:34,170
You know, I suddenly feel
very much more optimistic
about this whole thing.

328
00:27:34,248 --> 00:27:38,810
<i>Uh, it's not based on anything,</i>
<i>no facts, but,</i>

329
00:27:38,886 --> 00:27:41,218
you know,
I'm a superstitious guy.

330
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:46,727
<i>You know, I believe in signs.</i>
<i>I believe in palmistry and astrology</i>
<i>and all that kinda thing.</i>

331
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:49,160
You don't, I know that.
<i>Oh, definitely not.</i>

332
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,289
Let me see your hand.

333
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:57,727
<i>You see, Mr. Kennicutt,</i>
<i>that's your fate line</i>
<i>and it breaks there.</i>

334
00:27:57,805 --> 00:27:59,739
That was your bad fortune.

335
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:02,799
But it picks up again,
and that's interesting.

336
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:05,038
That's a very good omen.

337
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:07,546
May I?

338
00:28:07,615 --> 00:28:09,549
<i>Mmm.</i>

339
00:28:09,617 --> 00:28:11,983
Deep line of Apollo.

340
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:14,521
That's a man devoted to his work.

341
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:20,358
Your Apollo line
crosses the mound of the Moon.
You know, that's very rare.

342
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:22,919
And very impressive.

343
00:28:22,997 --> 00:28:27,593
That's the sign of a man
who's destined to attain
a very particular kind of distinction.

344
00:28:27,668 --> 00:28:29,659
That's a very good sign.

345
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:32,662
I know you think it's silly,

346
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,208
but I'm gonna make a believer
out of you before I'm done.

347
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:37,210
It was very nice meeting you.
Nice to have met you.

348
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:39,269
Bye-bye.

349
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:45,051
Oh, Mr. Brimmer.
Large thumb, low mound of Venus.

350
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,054
That means ambition,
purposefulness.

351
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:50,590
<i>That's a closet, Lieutenant.</i>

352
00:28:50,658 --> 00:28:53,218
[Chuckles]
Oh, gee. I'm sorry.

353
00:28:53,294 --> 00:28:55,091
A lot of people
make the same mistake.

354
00:28:56,163 --> 00:28:59,894
Say, that's a terrific-looking
set of clubs. Do you mind?

355
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,901
Go ahead.

356
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:07,166
These seem light.
Are these ladies' clubs?

357
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:10,938
- They were Lenore's.
- You didn't say she played golf,
did you?

358
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:12,945
You mentioned tennis
and skin diving.

359
00:29:13,013 --> 00:29:16,949
- That's because she just started.
- Ahh. I see. Where'd she play?

360
00:29:17,017 --> 00:29:20,043
At the country club.
<i>I see. At the club.</i>

361
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:24,455
<i>Well, I was just wondering</i>
<i>why shejust didn't keep her clubs</i>
<i>in the locker room?</i>

362
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:28,154
<i>She did.</i>
<i>That's an extra set</i>
<i>she used to take lessons with.</i>

363
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:31,357
Oh, I see.
Well, that explains it. Right.

364
00:29:31,432 --> 00:29:36,165
Uh, you mean
she didn't take lessons at her own club?
She took them someplace else?

365
00:29:36,237 --> 00:29:38,762
Sky Lane.
Why, is it important?

366
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,708
It's not important. It's just I like to
get that background information
very precise if I can.

367
00:29:46,914 --> 00:29:49,382
Bye.

368
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,918
- Is this the right door?
- [Chuckles] Yes.

369
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,116
Well, what was that
all about?

370
00:30:00,194 --> 00:30:04,654
Well, I think, uh, police techniques
have changed a little over the years.

371
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:33,593
Here, try it again.

372
00:30:33,661 --> 00:30:36,994
And remember, keep the back
of your left hand straight.

373
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:41,694
None of this.
Just stroke it easy, all right?

374
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:53,269
Oh, that was good.
You're getting better.

375
00:30:53,347 --> 00:30:56,111
Well, I still don't think
I'm ever gonna learn this game.

376
00:30:56,183 --> 00:31:00,279
Oh, you just have to
keep your eye on the ball,
watch your concentration.

377
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:02,288
You're coming along fine.

378
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:04,381
Do we have time
for another bucket?

379
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,392
Sorry, Jenny. Time's up.
Tomorrow, 3:00.

380
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,451
Tomorrow then.

381
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:29,079
You a member of the club?

382
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:34,018
Uh, no. No, I'm,
uh, Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm from the police.

383
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:40,283
[Mumbles]

384
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:45,765
What's the problem?
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about a Lenore Kennicutt.

385
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:48,427
Uh, you knew her?

386
00:31:48,502 --> 00:31:50,470
Not very well.

387
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:52,597
I gave her a few lessons.

388
00:31:52,673 --> 00:31:56,609
I see. Uh, well, this is
your appointment book, isn't it?

389
00:31:56,677 --> 00:31:58,770
Well, you should know.
You've been looking at it.

390
00:31:58,846 --> 00:32:00,780
Well, no offense.
I was just killing time.

391
00:32:00,848 --> 00:32:02,873
But, uh, you know,
now that you mention it,

392
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,384
I see that you gave her
a lot of lessons.

393
00:32:05,452 --> 00:32:08,888
She liked the game.
I see.

394
00:32:08,956 --> 00:32:13,325
Well, look here's the thing.
Um, since you spent a lot of time
with her,

395
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:16,227
I was wondering if you could
give me some help.

396
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:18,231
How?
Was she the type of woman...

397
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,063
now this is just between
you and me...

398
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:24,070
was she the type of woman
who was on the lookout?

399
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:27,733
I mean, did you ever notice her
give her eye to any of the men
around here?

400
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:31,744
Uh, look, Lieutenant.
We better get one thing straight.

401
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:34,645
I teach them golf
and I play in their tournaments,

402
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:37,081
but I don't get involved
in their personal lives.

403
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:39,642
If they wanna pair off,
that's none of my business.

404
00:32:42,323 --> 00:32:45,759
Okay. All right.
Uh, well, thanks a lot.

405
00:32:45,826 --> 00:32:49,091
It's quite all right.
Take it easy.

406
00:32:49,163 --> 00:32:51,757
Uh, say, uh,

407
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:53,993
what kind of club is this?

408
00:32:56,136 --> 00:32:58,730
<i>Oh, that's a number one wood.</i>

409
00:32:58,806 --> 00:33:00,774
Number one wood.

410
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:04,333
Listen, uh, could you
give me a lesson?

411
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:06,140
What?

412
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:08,943
No, I'm serious.
You know what my trouble is?

413
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:11,541
I work too hard.
Never out of the office.

414
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:14,417
<i>I figure this:</i>
<i>If I could take up a sport,</i>

415
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:16,683
get out in the fresh air
and get some exercise,

416
00:33:16,757 --> 00:33:18,691
that'd do me some good.

417
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,886
- What do you say?
- Well, I...

418
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:25,557
<i>Just for a few minutes.</i>
<i>Just to, you know, start to swing.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

419
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,246
Say, you know what was a funny thing
about your appointments
with Mrs. Kennicutt?

420
00:33:41,348 --> 00:33:43,942
Uh, the first two
were in the morning...

421
00:33:44,018 --> 00:33:47,181
and all the rest,
and I counted 13 of them,

422
00:33:47,254 --> 00:33:49,916
uh, they were always in the middle
or the late afternoon.

423
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:53,517
So?
Uh, well,
I guess it's not important.

424
00:33:53,594 --> 00:33:57,428
I guess it's nothing.
Uh, wait a minute.
I'll take off my coat.

425
00:33:57,498 --> 00:33:59,762
Except that, uh,

426
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:02,734
now, every time
you had an appointment
with Mrs. Kennicutt,

427
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:05,067
it was always
the last lesson of the day.

428
00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:09,198
I like to finish
at a reasonable hour.
Doesn't everyone?

429
00:34:09,276 --> 00:34:12,609
Oh, I see.
So those days, you left the club.

430
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,275
I thought maybe you'd hang around to
see if you could pick up an odd lesson.

431
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,580
Well, I didn't always go home.

432
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:20,779
Oh, who said anything
about going home?

433
00:34:21,855 --> 00:34:25,120
Oh. What I mean is I didn't always
leave the club. Sometimes...

434
00:34:25,192 --> 00:34:27,717
Hey, listen.
Can I help you out?

435
00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:31,196
Don't say anything else.
You don't have an attorney.

436
00:34:31,265 --> 00:34:35,133
<i>Wait until you get an attorney.</i>
<i>This way you can hurt your case.</i>

437
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:38,399
Believe me,
I know something about my business.

438
00:34:38,472 --> 00:34:41,908
<i>I don't know nothing about golf,</i>
<i>you know. See that's your business.</i>

439
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:44,500
I know something about my business.

440
00:34:44,578 --> 00:34:47,240
And believe me, you know,
down through the years, uh,

441
00:34:47,314 --> 00:34:52,183
you get so that you develop
a nose for things, you see?

442
00:34:52,252 --> 00:34:54,618
<i>And,</i> uh...

443
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:09,896
After a while, the old nose
just tells you when someone's
not giving you the truth.

444
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:16,204
<i>Now, uh,</i>
<i>I'm gonna forget about the lesson,</i>
<i>'cause I could never learn this game,</i>

445
00:35:16,276 --> 00:35:18,210
but I'll be back to talk to you.

446
00:35:23,517 --> 00:35:25,985
<i>Ground covered by the police</i>
<i>is not our concern.</i>

447
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:30,882
One thing to bear in mind,
money was taken.

448
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,892
Granted, it could have
been a smoke screen,

449
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,556
but sometimes the obvious answer
is the correct one.

450
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:39,565
Now, Brooks...
Yes, sir?

451
00:35:39,633 --> 00:35:43,069
Check into her banking account
with particular attention to withdrawals.

452
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:47,938
See if you can find out how much cash
she was carrying that day.
Mr. Kennicutt will be glad to cooperate.

453
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:52,638
Now, my theory, gentlemen,
and you will gear your efforts
in this direction,

454
00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:55,648
Mrs. Kennicutt was walking
along the Pacific Coast Highway.

455
00:35:55,716 --> 00:35:58,651
She was forced into a car...

456
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:00,914
by someone.

457
00:36:00,988 --> 00:36:03,047
The motive was robbery.

458
00:36:03,123 --> 00:36:06,524
She probably fought back.
In any case, she was killed.

459
00:36:06,593 --> 00:36:08,527
The murderer drove around
in a panic...

460
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:11,530
and finally all the way out to here,
where he got rid of the body.

461
00:36:11,598 --> 00:36:13,532
<i>[Intercom Buzzer]</i>
Yes?

462
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,864
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Lieutenant Columbo to see you.</i>
Who?

463
00:36:15,936 --> 00:36:18,598
Oh, yes.
Yes, send him in.

464
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,103
Gentlemen, we'll finish this later.
I'll call you. Thank you.

465
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:48,397
Lieutenant!

466
00:36:48,468 --> 00:36:50,459
<i>Come in!</i>

467
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:56,572
Whew! Boy.
This is quite a building.

468
00:36:56,643 --> 00:36:58,941
<i>This all yours?</i>
'Fraid so.

469
00:36:59,012 --> 00:37:04,006
Must be a lot of business
for your kinda company these days.
Well, we can't handle it all.

470
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:06,678
Sit down.
Uh, listen, your secretary called.

471
00:37:06,753 --> 00:37:11,019
She said you wanted to see the files
on the case, so I thought it'd be a lot
safer if I brought 'em over myself.

472
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:14,492
Oh. That's very nice of you.
It wasn't necessary,
but I appreciate it very much.

473
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:16,495
Uh, want some coffee?
No. No, thanks.

474
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:18,531
Thank you.
Uh, those are the duplicates.

475
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,533
Okay.

476
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:22,865
Yes, this will help.

477
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:28,867
A lot of it. I wonder if you can
give me a little rundown.

478
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:31,433
Well, it's just what I told
Mr. Kennicutt.

479
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:36,073
No leads. Except, you know,
I was looking through that stuff
last night.

480
00:37:36,149 --> 00:37:38,083
Mm-hmm.

481
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:41,450
And, uh, drives my wife crazy,
you know.

482
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:45,924
<i>Because we have the lamp</i>
<i>right next to the bed,</i>
<i>and the poor thing, she can't sleep.</i>

483
00:37:45,993 --> 00:37:48,154
Did you find anything?

484
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:51,595
No, not really. Well, uh,

485
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:54,998
<i>take the autopsy report.</i>

486
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:58,003
Yes. Here it is.

487
00:37:58,071 --> 00:38:01,598
You see now,
that jibed with something
that I noticed about the body...

488
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:05,338
the first time I saw it,
and that bothered me.

489
00:38:05,412 --> 00:38:07,880
Mrs. Kennicutt
was struck on the left cheek,
and she had a bruise.

490
00:38:07,948 --> 00:38:10,280
And she had a weird kinda cut.

491
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,251
<i>Um...</i>

492
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,084
Do you see what I mean?

493
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:18,488
Um, no. I don't think so.

494
00:38:18,558 --> 00:38:21,652
Well, let's start with the cut,
because that's what bothered me.

495
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:26,961
I said to myself,
'Now what in the world
could have caused that kind of cut?"

496
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:29,798
Uh, does this lighter work?

497
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,498
Yeah, I think so.

498
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:34,506
Uh...

499
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:44,473
Uh, wh... where was I?
About the cut.

500
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:47,611
Oh, yes.
What could have caused the cut?

501
00:38:47,688 --> 00:38:51,556
I said to myself, ' It could be a ring."

502
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:56,221
A ring of... You mean a finger ring.
This kind of ring.

503
00:38:56,296 --> 00:39:00,460
Yeah, something like that.
Now here's the way I figured it.

504
00:39:00,534 --> 00:39:02,934
Suppose you were gonna
strike somebody.

505
00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:04,937
Suppose it was a woman.

506
00:39:05,005 --> 00:39:07,997
Now, do you punch her?
Well, maybe.

507
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:11,476
But more than likely,
you hit with your open hand.

508
00:39:11,545 --> 00:39:13,479
Either this way or this way.
Mm-hmm.

509
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:17,415
Now, if you hit this way,
then the ring is not gonna
cause any cut.

510
00:39:17,484 --> 00:39:21,978
So I figured it was
a backhand blow like this.
All right?

511
00:39:23,857 --> 00:39:27,258
I still don't follow you too well,
because that would, uh,
that would put it over on...

512
00:39:27,327 --> 00:39:29,261
But I used my right hand,
you see?
Yeah.

513
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:33,425
And if the ring was on the right hand,
then the bruise would be
on the right cheek.

514
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,836
But it was on the left cheek,
so the murderer was left-handed.

515
00:39:38,905 --> 00:39:41,305
Struck her like this.

516
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:45,778
Which means
the murderer is left-handed.
Well, that's interesting.

517
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:50,283
That's provided, of course,
all these, uh, speculations are valid.

518
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,114
Yeah, I would say that
we have a left-handed murderer,

519
00:39:53,186 --> 00:39:56,781
and, uh,
and an unpremeditated crime.

520
00:39:56,857 --> 00:39:59,587
We have?
<i>Oh, I think so, yes.</i>

521
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:03,527
I mean, I don't think
a man kills with his hands
unless he's angry.

522
00:40:03,597 --> 00:40:07,863
<i>As a matter of fact, you know,</i>
<i>maybe he didn't mean to do it.</i>

523
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:09,868
<i>Could be.</i>

524
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:12,632
<i>You know,</i>
<i>maybe it was an accident.</i>

525
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:15,903
You know, I got a feeling
that when we find our friend,

526
00:40:15,976 --> 00:40:19,104
it's gonna turn out
that he has a terrible temper.

527
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:21,147
Hmm.
[Chuckles]

528
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:25,343
<i>Well, maybe you're right.</i>

529
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:28,411
I certainly wish I had your crystal ball,
Lieutenant.

530
00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:39,392
Why don't you let me
digest this material,
and then we'll talk again.

531
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:42,492
Okay. All right. Fine.

532
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:45,504
Sure. Listen.
I want to thank you
for the time.

533
00:40:45,572 --> 00:40:47,506
Listen. Thank you.
Right.

534
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:49,508
Oh, listen,
before I forget, uh...

535
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:52,568
Gee whiz.

536
00:40:52,646 --> 00:40:54,637
I didn't wanna forget that.

537
00:40:54,714 --> 00:40:57,342
But, uh, let's see.

538
00:40:57,417 --> 00:41:00,079
I had a receipt here
that I wanted you to sign.

539
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:02,087
Well, listen,
let's just make one up.

540
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:04,123
<i>It's a receipt</i>
<i>for the files.</i>

541
00:41:09,896 --> 00:41:12,421
Isn't that weird?

542
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:15,059
- What a coincidence.
- What's that?

543
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:20,198
<i>Here, a moment ago, we were</i>
<i>talking about left-handed people,</i>
<i>and you're left-handed.</i>

544
00:41:25,278 --> 00:41:27,439
And right-handed.

545
00:41:27,514 --> 00:41:30,039
<i>I'm ambidextrous.</i>

546
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:33,143
That means I don't favor
either hand particularly.

547
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,384
It's a character trait shared
by about 10% of the world's population.

548
00:41:37,457 --> 00:41:39,482
Ten percent?
No kidding?

549
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:41,891
Anything else?
Uh, no.

550
00:41:41,962 --> 00:41:46,092
No, I don't think so. Uh, oh, listen.
This is a little bit off the subject.

551
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:50,865
My sister-in-law, she wants to
buy a place out at the beach.
How do you like it out there?

552
00:41:50,937 --> 00:41:53,303
Who told you I was living
out at the beach?
Well, no one.

553
00:41:53,373 --> 00:41:55,534
L... I noticed your car
out in front of Mr. Kennicutt's.

554
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:58,169
You know, you parked it there
in the driveway.

555
00:41:58,245 --> 00:42:00,236
<i>As I was walking by,</i>
<i>I saw the chrome was tarnished.</i>

556
00:42:00,313 --> 00:42:03,840
You know what the salt air does to it.
It just eats the life out of it.

557
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:05,851
Yeah, that part's a problem, all right.

558
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:08,683
Uh, you're a very observant man,
Lieutenant.

559
00:42:08,755 --> 00:42:11,485
That's not what my wife says.
<i>[Laughs]</i>

560
00:42:11,558 --> 00:42:15,756
Well, you tell your sister-in-law
that she will love it at the beach...

561
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:19,492
if she doesn't mind that problem
with the salt air on the chrome.

562
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:21,830
I'll give her that message.
And thanks again.

563
00:42:21,902 --> 00:42:24,268
Thank you.

564
00:42:24,337 --> 00:42:26,601
Oh, uh, say.

565
00:42:26,673 --> 00:42:29,107
Have you ever been
in Mr. Kennicutt's house?

566
00:42:29,176 --> 00:42:32,441
Yes, I met you there.

567
00:42:32,512 --> 00:42:34,605
No, I didn't mean the big house.
I meant out at the beach.

568
00:42:34,681 --> 00:42:39,209
<i>I was just wondering, because</i>
<i>your beach house and his beach house,</i>
<i>they're fairly close, aren't they?</i>

569
00:42:39,286 --> 00:42:41,584
No. It's a couple miles.

570
00:42:41,655 --> 00:42:45,785
That close?
Tsk. Isn't that a coincidence?

571
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:46,917
[Chuckles]

572
00:42:46,993 --> 00:42:49,325
<i>I'll tell you,</i>
<i>this case is just full of'em.</i>

573
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:55,126
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

574
00:43:55,662 --> 00:43:58,893
[Sighs]
Why don't you and I take a walk?

575
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,453
When you showed up today,
I... I kinda panicked.

576
00:44:23,523 --> 00:44:26,754
Then you did have
an affair with her?

577
00:44:26,826 --> 00:44:29,761
Turning on the ladies
is about the only thing
I do well.

578
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:32,992
I'm not a very good golfer.
Yeah, go on.

579
00:44:33,066 --> 00:44:35,500
Well, it was pretty good
for a while...

580
00:44:35,568 --> 00:44:37,559
at least for me.

581
00:44:37,637 --> 00:44:40,071
She got the guilts.

582
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,042
Funny thing, I think
she really loved her husband.

583
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:49,480
One day she said,
'Ken, this is bad for both of us.
Let's call it off." So we did.

584
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,777
Must have shook you up
when we found her dead.

585
00:44:52,852 --> 00:44:55,412
I couldn't believe it.

586
00:44:55,488 --> 00:44:59,652
Then I got to thinking,
sooner or later, you guys
would find out about me.

587
00:44:59,726 --> 00:45:01,660
<i>Maybe even think</i>
<i>I killed her.</i>

588
00:45:01,728 --> 00:45:05,789
<i>The night she died, I was...</i>
<i>I was home watching the tube.</i>

589
00:45:05,865 --> 00:45:08,732
No calls. No company.

590
00:45:08,802 --> 00:45:12,135
<i>No alibi. That's...</i>
<i>That's why I started to run.</i>

591
00:45:12,205 --> 00:45:15,663
Uh-huh.
I can understand that.

592
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:20,679
You didn't kill her.

593
00:45:20,747 --> 00:45:25,047
<i>No, no.</i>
I know that, but this afternoon,
you gave me the impression...

594
00:45:25,118 --> 00:45:30,055
No. You're in the clear.
You got nothing to worry about.

595
00:45:30,123 --> 00:45:34,355
<i>You see, whoever did this,</i>
<i>he had to wear a ring.</i>

596
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:36,987
<i>Now, you don't wear a ring.</i>

597
00:45:38,331 --> 00:45:40,390
Well, I could have taken it off.

598
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:43,868
No, not with that tan,
because that would show.

599
00:45:45,805 --> 00:45:48,205
<i>Now listen.</i>
<i>Tell me something.</i>

600
00:45:48,274 --> 00:45:50,333
Mrs. Kennicutt...

601
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:53,573
Did Mrs. Kennicutt
ever indicate to you...

602
00:45:53,646 --> 00:45:57,047
that she was concerned
that her husband knew
about you two?

603
00:45:57,117 --> 00:45:59,278
No.

604
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:01,286
That's funny that you
mention it though,

605
00:46:01,354 --> 00:46:03,447
because, well,
I was concerned.

606
00:46:03,523 --> 00:46:05,184
Why?

607
00:46:05,258 --> 00:46:09,695
Well, Lenore never saw anyone,
but I'm sure we were being followed.

608
00:46:09,763 --> 00:46:11,697
By who?

609
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:14,165
Well, there was
this one guy in particular.

610
00:46:14,234 --> 00:46:18,261
Sharp, well-dressed.
I only caught him in flashes, but...

611
00:46:18,338 --> 00:46:23,173
Well, he... he had a crew cut.
Kind of an ex-marine type.

612
00:46:25,845 --> 00:46:28,507
<i>[Telephone Ringing]</i>

613
00:46:28,581 --> 00:46:31,516
- Yes?
- Wilcox, Mr. Brimmer.

614
00:46:31,584 --> 00:46:34,917
The subject is meeting with Archer,
and they've engaged in conversation.

615
00:46:34,988 --> 00:46:37,320
Did you overhear anything?

616
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:41,656
No, sir. But Archer seems to
be doing most of the talking.

617
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:44,788
Maintain the surveillance
and report to me in the morning.

618
00:46:44,864 --> 00:46:46,889
Yes, sir.

619

<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
Why, you little bum, you.

620
00:47:02,515 --> 00:47:04,745
Hello?

621
00:47:04,818 --> 00:47:08,117
Oh, yes, he is. Leo.

622
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:10,122
<i>Mr. Brimmer.</i>

623
00:47:18,531 --> 00:47:21,329
- Yes, sir?
- I'm sorry to trouble you at home, Leo.

624
00:47:21,401 --> 00:47:24,529
No sweat.
Just playing with Teddy.

625
00:47:24,604 --> 00:47:29,132
Well, I've got a little something
I want you to do for me. It may
complicate your life a little bit.

626
00:47:29,209 --> 00:47:31,200
- When?
- Immediately.

627
00:47:31,277 --> 00:47:35,236
- Set it up through my secretary.
- Yes, sir. I'll be in touch.

628
00:47:45,925 --> 00:47:48,621
Every one of our operatives
is a skilled marksman.

629
00:47:48,695 --> 00:47:51,528
Actually, our policy
is to avoid the use of the weapon.

630
00:47:51,598 --> 00:47:53,691
<i>This is our memory bank,</i>
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

631
00:47:53,766 --> 00:47:55,893
<i>Millions ofbits</i>

632
00:47:55,969 --> 00:47:59,405
all cross-filed and on tape,
immediately available.

633
00:47:59,472 --> 00:48:04,341
There are more electrical impulses
in this room than in your brain.

634
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,344
Hard to believe.
[Chuckles]

635
00:48:06,412 --> 00:48:08,676
We here at Brimmer Associates
use the most up-to-date equipment.

636
00:48:08,748 --> 00:48:11,376
<i>Years ahead of what you use</i>
<i>at police headquarters.</i>

637
00:48:11,451 --> 00:48:14,079
Company cars...
custom designed for us.

638
00:48:14,153 --> 00:48:17,645
Most of them with telephonic
or radio communication.

639
00:48:17,724 --> 00:48:21,057
Phew! It's very impressive.

640
00:48:21,127 --> 00:48:23,095
Oh, uh, just one moment,
Lieutenant.

641
00:48:23,162 --> 00:48:25,289
One other thing
that might interest you.

642
00:48:25,365 --> 00:48:27,560
If you'll just move
past this gate.

643
00:48:32,372 --> 00:48:35,432
- It's not working.
- Well, it has to be.

644
00:48:35,508 --> 00:48:37,442
You're carrying a gun,
aren't you, Lieutenant?

645
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,410
No.
No? Oh.

646
00:48:39,479 --> 00:48:42,039
<i>Well, that explains</i>
<i>the malfunction.</i>

647
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:45,778
Look here. A special system
is built into the gate.

648
00:48:45,852 --> 00:48:49,481
Now, if you had a gun,
it would have registered.

649
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:54,116
It's just like out at the airport.

650
00:48:54,193 --> 00:48:56,127
<i>It's a security precaution.</i>

651
00:48:56,195 --> 00:48:58,857
Not that we expect our clients
to be carrying concealed weapons,
but, uh,

652
00:48:58,932 --> 00:49:00,900
well, there have been
a few exceptions.

653
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:03,595
Really?
Well, a guy came in here
just about a month ago.

654
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,605
Harmless looking.
An accountant
for Mid-Century Oil.

655
00:49:06,673 --> 00:49:09,164
We were doing
a company audit.
<i>[Brimmer] Mr. Denning?</i>

656
00:49:10,243 --> 00:49:12,768
I asked you to show
the lieutenant around.

657
00:49:12,845 --> 00:49:17,748
<i>I did not suggest that you discuss</i>
<i>our confidential matters...</i>

658
00:49:17,817 --> 00:49:20,411
<i>with anyone at anytime!</i>

659
00:49:20,486 --> 00:49:23,649
Our clients pay us to be discreet.

660
00:49:24,724 --> 00:49:26,658
Yes, sir.

661
00:49:29,429 --> 00:49:31,363
Won't you come in, Lieutenant?

662
00:49:40,907 --> 00:49:44,104
Sorry about the outburst,
but my people have got to learn.

663
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:48,511
This is a business of trust.
I can't have them gossiping
about the clients.

664
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:50,515
Thank you, Henry.

665
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:52,608
Hope you'll have lunch with me.
Like quenelle of sole?

666
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:56,086
Uh, well, if it's fish,
I like fish. I love fish.

667
00:49:56,155 --> 00:49:59,249
Yeah, it's fish.
Drop your coat and dig in.

668
00:50:00,827 --> 00:50:04,661
On the Kennicutt case,
my men have come up
with an interesting lead.

669
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:07,325
There were two derelicts
seen in the area.

670
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,133
I have their description.
I sent them over to your office,
copies.

671
00:50:12,205 --> 00:50:14,833
Right.
Uh, I'll have that checked out.

672
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:17,034
Anything new on your end?

673
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:21,046
Uh, oh, yeah.
Yeah, we got a couple of things.

674
00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:26,084
<i>It seems as though Mrs. Kennicutt</i>
<i>was having an affair, you see?</i>

675
00:50:26,152 --> 00:50:29,781
Uh...

676
00:50:29,856 --> 00:50:33,758
Boy, this is delicious.
How do you make this stuff?

677
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:39,093
I'll have a recipe sent over to you.
You were saying?

678
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:41,224
Oh, yeah.
Uh, it seems as though...

679
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,236
Mrs. Kennicutt, uh,
she was having an affair.

680
00:50:45,304 --> 00:50:48,603
<i>And,</i> uh...
Oh?

681
00:50:48,675 --> 00:50:51,701
And, uh...
Oh, listen, when you send the recipe,
would you send it to the house?

682
00:50:51,778 --> 00:50:56,181
- Don't send it to the office.
- Yes, I'll send it to your house.

683
00:50:56,249 --> 00:50:59,707
Yeah, she was having an affair
with some golf pro at some country club.

684
00:50:59,786 --> 00:51:02,584
And, uh, here's
the interesting thing.

685
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:04,714
Not only
were they having an affair,

686
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:07,589
but it seems as though
they were being watched.

687
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,891
Now I got this nutty notion.

688
00:51:10,963 --> 00:51:14,194
Suppose Mr. Kennicutt, uh...

689
00:51:14,267 --> 00:51:17,134
I'll tell you, it's too far-fetched.

690
00:51:17,203 --> 00:51:19,728
Sometimes it helps to test it out.
Try me.

691
00:51:19,806 --> 00:51:24,743
It's really crazy. Well, listen.
It doesn't cost anything.

692
00:51:24,811 --> 00:51:27,746
Suppose...
Suppose Mr. Kennicutt...

693
00:51:27,814 --> 00:51:30,977
<i>hired somebody</i>
<i>to check up on his wife.</i>

694
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:34,213
<i>And this somebody</i>
<i>lied to him.</i>

695
00:51:35,288 --> 00:51:37,222
He said to Mr. Kennicutt, ' Look.

696
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:40,487
Your wife,
she's got a clean bill of health."

697
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,324
<i>Now this somebody,</i>
<i>whoever it is,</i>

698
00:51:43,396 --> 00:51:46,888
<i>he's in a perfect position</i>
<i>to blackmail Mrs. Kennicutt.</i>

699
00:51:46,966 --> 00:51:49,799
<i>Now suppose she refuses.</i>

700
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:54,238
See? She says,
'No, I'm gonna go tell my husband."

701
00:51:54,307 --> 00:51:58,505
Hmm.
I think it's a terrific motive,
don't you?

702
00:51:58,578 --> 00:52:02,446
Lieutenant, you have
a marvelously convoluted mind.

703
00:52:02,515 --> 00:52:04,983
I do?
I like it.

704
00:52:05,051 --> 00:52:09,044
The trouble with your theory is,
not only is it very tenuous,

705
00:52:09,122 --> 00:52:13,320
but it's impossible to prove,
isn't it?

706
00:52:13,392 --> 00:52:18,329
I, uh... Oh.
Got a little tomato on that there.

707
00:52:18,397 --> 00:52:20,922
<i>Well, I said it was nutty.</i>

708
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,560
<i>What do you think?</i>
<i>You think I oughta drop it, hmm?</i>

709
00:52:23,636 --> 00:52:25,968
[Clears Throat]
If you believe in it, stick to it.

710
00:52:26,038 --> 00:52:28,905
Run it on down.

711
00:52:28,975 --> 00:52:32,138
One other thing
you should keep in mind.

712
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:34,543
Nothing at all to do with the case.

713
00:52:34,614 --> 00:52:38,106
- What's that?
- Your future.

714
00:52:39,652 --> 00:52:42,815
<i>I'd like you to work</i>
<i>for Brimmer Associates.</i>

715
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:46,891

<i>That's why I had you taken</i>
<i>on a V.I.P. Tour.</i>

716
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:48,927
We're a growing organization.
You can see that.

717
00:52:48,995 --> 00:52:51,225
You'll be a valuable piece
of manpower for us.

718
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:55,495
Oh, boy. You really know
how to toss a curve.

719
00:52:55,568 --> 00:52:58,332
No, no, I don't mean it that way.
I'm quite serious.

720
00:52:59,405 --> 00:53:01,805
You're a good man, Columbo...
up here.

721
00:53:01,874 --> 00:53:04,274
<i>It's time you were thinking</i>
<i>about advancement.</i>

722
00:53:04,343 --> 00:53:06,368
<i>What does</i>
<i>a lieutenant make?</i>

723
00:53:06,445 --> 00:53:08,572
If you come with us,

724
00:53:08,648 --> 00:53:11,776
I'm almost positive
I can triple your yearly income.

725
00:53:11,851 --> 00:53:15,981
Whew! Boy.
I'll tell you, it's all so sudden.

726
00:53:16,055 --> 00:53:20,651
Uh, let me talk it over with my wife.

727
00:53:20,726 --> 00:53:23,388
Of course talk it over with your wife.
Think about it carefully.

728
00:53:23,462 --> 00:53:25,623
But remember,
we want you here.

729
00:53:25,698 --> 00:53:29,190
Listen. I'm very flattered.
I mean that.

730
00:53:29,268 --> 00:53:31,202
Just let me mull it over a little bit.

731
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:33,204
Well, while you're mulling,

732
00:53:33,272 --> 00:53:36,935
consider my career.

733
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:39,477
If I'd stayed with the force,

734
00:53:40,947 --> 00:53:43,211
by now,
probably with luck,

735
00:53:43,282 --> 00:53:46,445
I could have been
a captain of detectives.

736
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:50,216
Hmm?
With one eye on the promotion list,
and the other eye on my car payments.

737
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:52,223
No house by the ocean.

738

886
01:03:12,885 --> 01:03:17,447
Apparently, she was wearing
her contact lenses when she was killed.

887
01:03:17,523 --> 01:03:19,582
How's that significant?

888
01:03:19,658 --> 01:03:22,718
Well, there's a chance that
she might have lost one of them...

889
01:03:22,795 --> 01:03:25,855
maybe both of them
at the scene of the crime.

890
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:32,034
<i>Well, Arthur,</i>
<i>I don't like to be critical,</i>

891
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:35,198
<i>but that's more</i>
<i>than a long shot.</i>

892
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:37,333
You might as well buy
a lottery ticket.

893
01:03:37,409 --> 01:03:39,343
<i>Maybe not.</i>
<i>Listen to me.</i>

894
01:03:39,411 --> 01:03:43,040
My nephew wears those things,
and half of the time they're falling out.

895
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:46,141
<i>Now, the other morning at breakfast,</i>
<i>one of them ended up in the cereal.</i>

896
01:03:46,218 --> 01:03:49,085
<i>[Brimmer] Mrs. Kennicutt</i>
<i>is not your nephew, Lieutenant.</i>

897
01:03:49,154 --> 01:03:54,182
Listen. Mrs. Kennicutt was struck forcibly.
Now let's bear that in mind.

898
01:03:54,259 --> 01:03:56,625
Why isn't it possible
that they were knocked loose?

899
01:03:56,695 --> 01:03:58,629
Anything's possible.

900
01:03:58,697 --> 01:04:01,860
The autopsy report
said nothing about
any of this at all.

901
01:04:01,934 --> 01:04:05,700
Listen. Forget about
the autopsy report. I checked with
the medical examiner about that.

902
01:04:05,771 --> 01:04:08,331
They snuffed it off.
They didn't even bother to look.

903
01:04:08,407 --> 01:04:11,035
All they were concerned about
was the cause of death.

904
01:04:11,109 --> 01:04:13,043
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

905
01:04:20,686 --> 01:04:23,883
<i>Well, I hope it's not a waste.</i>

906
01:04:23,956 --> 01:04:25,890
What else can I do?

907
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:28,324
I've got to pursue
every possibility.

908
01:04:28,393 --> 01:04:31,851
Arthur, it's almost
a criminal breach...

909
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:35,764
to disappoint you now
after what you've been through.

910
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:49,140
Move over.

911
01:04:49,214 --> 01:04:53,947
Listen. We're in luck.
The right contact lens is missing,
and it's not in the coffin.

912
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:57,455
Well, it might have fallen out
in the morgue, I guess.

913
01:04:57,523 --> 01:04:59,787
Or in the ambulance. Or in the street.

914
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:03,259
<i>She might have lost it</i>
<i>before she was killed.</i>

915
01:05:03,328 --> 01:05:07,560
Could be a hundred places.
<i>That's true, but maybe...</i>

916
01:05:07,633 --> 01:05:09,567
and this is what
we gotta hope for...

917
01:05:09,635 --> 01:05:11,865
maybe it's at the place
where she was murdered.

918
01:05:11,937 --> 01:05:14,167
<i>[Kennicutt]</i>
<i>But we don't know</i>
<i>where that place is.</i>

<i>No, sir, we don't.</i>
<i>We don't know for sure.</i>

920

921

<i>Unless you can be specific,</i>
<i>I can't help.</i>

922
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,005
I think the lieutenant
deserves some room.
Don't you?

923
01:05:24,082 --> 01:05:26,642
As you wish.
You go your own way,
Lieutenant.

924
01:05:26,718 --> 01:05:29,050
Thank you, sir. I will.
But keep us posted.

925

I'll keep you posted.

I only wish one thing.

928
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:44,632
I wish the murderer
knew about this.
Why?

929

<i>There'd be a piece of conclusive evidence</i>
<i>that might be lying around in his premises,</i>

<i>and he'd have to find it</i>
<i>before we did.</i>

934
01:06:29,982 --> 01:06:33,816
Listen. I'm sorry
to bother you at this hour,
but, uh... May I come in?

935
01:06:33,885 --> 01:06:37,150
Yes, sure. Come on in.
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

936
01:06:37,222 --> 01:06:40,589
Okay. Fine,
if you can make it a little brief.
It's been a late day.

937
01:06:40,659 --> 01:06:45,221
Oh, sure. Say, this is
some terrific place you got here.

938
01:06:45,297 --> 01:06:47,925
And you got the sound
of the ocean all the time, huh?
Yeah.

939
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,230
Well, me, I love the beach.
I love it.

940
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:53,567
Except when the water gets cold,
then I don't like to go in.
Then I like a pool.

941
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:56,073
Lieutenant, did you say you
had something on your mind?

942
01:06:57,142 --> 01:07:02,011
Oh, yeah.
It's about that job you offered me.

943
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,048
I've been giving it a lot of thought.

944
01:07:04,116 --> 01:07:07,574
Uh, as a matter of fact,
uh, I haven't been able to sleep.

945
01:07:07,653 --> 01:07:11,714
And, uh...

946
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:16,227
Boy, this is a fantastic rug.
My wife would love this rug.

947
01:07:16,294 --> 01:07:20,390
We gotta get a new rug,
and this is just the kind she wants.

948
01:07:20,465 --> 01:07:22,797
Fantastic piling, huh?

949
01:07:22,868 --> 01:07:24,802
Very soft.

950
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:28,033
Bet you could lose a shoe in here
for a week, you wouldn't find it.
It's late.

951
01:07:28,106 --> 01:07:30,597
I still got a lot of work to do.
You were talking about my job offer.

952
01:07:31,677 --> 01:07:34,840
I really don't think I'd be very happy
making a change, you know.

953
01:07:34,913 --> 01:07:37,780
I like it where I am.
It's not a bad life.

954
01:07:37,849 --> 01:07:41,376
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Uh, is that final?

955
01:07:41,453 --> 01:07:45,082
I think so, yes.
No hard feelings?

956
01:07:45,157 --> 01:07:47,887
No, no, certainly not.
I just, uh...

957
01:07:47,959 --> 01:07:50,223
Well, I think you're
making a mistake.
That's all.

958
01:07:50,295 --> 01:07:52,422
You're probably right.
You know, my wife,

959
01:07:52,497 --> 01:07:55,398
she's always said
I don't have enough ambition.

960
01:07:55,467 --> 01:07:59,426
You know what it was
that really made up my mind?

961
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:02,200
What was that?
The Kennicutt case.

962
01:08:02,274 --> 01:08:05,107
I don't wanna give up
working on it just now.

963
01:08:05,177 --> 01:08:07,839
Not when I'm so close
to a solution.

964
01:08:07,913 --> 01:08:11,576
Well, uh, are you gonna
let me in on it?

Oh, certainly.

It's an emergency.

984

You were searching the trunk,

more comfortable downtown.

992
01:12:24,803 --> 01:12:29,968
It wasn't... premeditated.

993
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:32,509
I hardly knew your wife.

995
01:12:48,059 --> 01:12:49,993
It happened.

996
01:12:56,301 --> 01:12:58,963
How'd you get it?

997
01:12:59,037 --> 01:13:03,167
I got it from
the cut on her cheek
and your ring.

998
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:05,869
You never should have
let me read your palm.

999
01:13:05,944 --> 01:13:09,311
'Cause then I felt the ring
and I felt the two diamonds
sticking out...

1000
01:13:09,381 --> 01:13:11,906
and that raised
rectangular border.

1001
01:13:11,983 --> 01:13:15,043
That matched up
with the cut on her cheek.

1002
01:13:16,121 --> 01:13:19,887
You should have
taken that job.

1003
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:38,070
You know,
we're lucky Lenore lost this.

1004
01:13:38,143 --> 01:13:41,135
Uh, she didn't lose it.
What?

1005
01:13:41,212 --> 01:13:44,579
When I spoke
to the medical examiner
at the cemetery,

1006
01:13:44,649 --> 01:13:48,585
he told me
that both contact lenses
were on the body.

1007
01:13:48,653 --> 01:13:51,884
But that's impossible.
If it isn't hers, whose was it?

1008
01:13:51,956 --> 01:13:55,084
Who knows?
Anyway, it doesn't make any difference.

1009
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,152
The fact that it's not
the real contact lens,
that doesn't count.

1010
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:00,789
What does count
is Mr. Brimmer's actions...

1011
01:14:00,865 --> 01:14:03,993
coming here tonight,
trying to get rid of that thing...

1012
01:14:04,069 --> 01:14:06,629
and doing it all
in front of witnesses.

1013
01:14:08,173 --> 01:14:10,641
What would you have done
if the car hadrt broken down?

1014
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:13,006
You couldn't set up
this trap.

1015
01:14:13,078 --> 01:14:18,277
Well, I guess we would have
found some other way.

1016
01:14:18,349 --> 01:14:21,147
You know what this place
reminds me of?

1017
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:25,613
Just seeing all these cars...

1018
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:28,158
<i>You know, in our neighborhood,</i>
<i>we had a bunch ofjokers.</i>

1019
01:14:28,226 --> 01:14:30,922
I mean, we were
a real wild bunch of guys.

1020
01:14:30,995 --> 01:14:34,021
And we figured out a perfect way
to put a car out of commission.

1021
01:14:34,099 --> 01:14:37,626
You take a potato,
you stick it in the exhaust pipe.

1022
01:14:37,702 --> 01:14:42,002
<i>It doesn't cause any damage,</i>
<i>but the car won't start.</i>

1023
01:14:42,073 --> 01:14:46,100
It was a terrible thing to do.
And I got a feeling...

1024
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:51,342
that the reason I became a cop
was to make up for all those jokes
I played when I was a kid.
