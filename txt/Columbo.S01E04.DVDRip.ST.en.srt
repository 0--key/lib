Haven't you ever seen people

Oh, yes.
But, uh,

108
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,969
you see, it's this
crazy signature that bothers me...

109
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,873
DeGrote. George DeGrote.
Quite famous.

110
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:20,435
I thought so.
Isn't that funny?

00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,347
'Cause I noticed the signatures

Yes, it does.

has anybody tried to
rob this place before?

120
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,779
Certainly. This place is
a magnet for art thieves.

121
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,584
It's one of the finest collections

Is that so?

122
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:08,650
Yes.
Really? Very impressive.

If you came in here
to grab some paintings,
wouldn't you grab a DeGrote first...

00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:27,806
instead of a Birnbaum?
Perhaps.
But then, I'm an art critic.

00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,475
You're the detective.
You're the art critic.
That's right.

128
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,544
And I'm gonna need
a lot of your help.
I suppose you noticed that already.

129
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:41,616
Uh, like in there,
there's two little frames
and they're empty,

Oh, no.

Now, Mr. Evans
wasn't quite sure either.

00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,794
He thought that one of'em
had some dancing girls.

00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:56,307
But I don't think
he knows much about art either.

135
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,606
He also said that
a lot of these things
had just been rehung.

136
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,874

some kind of a traveling exhibit?

00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:06,111

out in the hall there. I unpacked
most of them myself.

138
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,677

a piece of that wrapping paper
had been torn loose.

the kids use in school?

145
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,769
Nobody ever used pastels
like Degas, Lieutenant.

146
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,873
These two alone together
happen to be won'th
over a half million dollars.

[Whistles]

148
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,421

150
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:51,787
No, I mean that out there,
somebody picked a Birnbaum first.

151
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:56,597
Then when your uncle interfered,
then when he went to his desk
and took out a gun,

152
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,662
<i>then when he was killed...</i>
<i>in the middle of all that, then...</i>

153
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,231
the thief suddenly got smart,

154
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,142
and he took two of
the most valuable paintings
in the house and he ran.

155
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,107
Guess that does seem
a bit inconsistent, doesn't it?

156

its own inconsistencies.

Oh, Sally,
nice of you to come.

I wanna try something.

159

Uh, Mr. Kingston,
you might be interested in this.

160
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,665
Uh, you were here?
Yeah, that's right.

161
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,000
Wait there.
I'll holler.
All right.

162
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,269
Hi.
Hi. Hi, Charlie.
How are you?

163
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,834
What's all this?

164
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,972
Well, you see,
they have private patrolmen here
to make checks at every hour.

165
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,539
At 11:00...
No, no, no.
I mean this, this, this.

166
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,176
What? Oh, the lock?
Yes.

167
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:52,088
Well, you see, he found that open.
The lock was scarred like
it'd been forced from the outside.

168
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:56,322
Of course, what I don't understand
is why the burglar alarm didn't go off.

169
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,228
A professional thief could
manage that pretty well, couldn't he?
No, no, no.

170
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,630
You see, professionals,
they always pick windows.

171
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,863
They're just easier to crack.
Sally, are you ready?
Whenever you are.

172
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,930
Okay. When I holler inside,
you run just the way
I told you to run.

173
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay! Here she goes!

174
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:31,186
Well?
<i>[Guard] That's it.</i>
<i>That's what I heard.</i>

175
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,926
<i>I couldn't be sure before.</i>
<i>I was running myself.</i>

176
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,833
Now you heard high heels
on those stone steps?
Yes, sir.

177
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,564
Thank you very much.
You bet.

178
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,629
Charlie, will you get Sally?
Wait a minute.

179
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,676
You mean, you think
the thief was a woman?
One of'em.

180
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:49,373
- One of them?
- Well, there were too many pictures for
one person to carry, don't you think?

181
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:54,249
<i>And besides, the burglar alarm thing.</i>
<i>You know, there's only one way</i>
<i>to really beat that...</i>

182
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,448
is if you have somebody else
from the inside open the door.

183
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:02,859
- I don't think I understand.
- You know what?
That's the trouble. Neither do I.

184
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:09,023
Well, if you ever want to know
any more about art, Lieutenant.

185
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,935
Oh. Thank you very much.
Well, listen, now that you mention it,
tell me this.

186
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,667
How does a thief get rid of
a painting like that?

187
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,404
I mean, if they're that famous,
how can anybody sell it?

188
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:23,471
Well, someone in
a foreign country maybe.

189
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:29,385
Although, art thieves usually try to
make a deal of some kind with the owner,
the gallery, the insurance company.

190
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,618
You see, that's what I thought.
It's just like a kidnapping.

191
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,182
Yes.
In other words, what they want really
is the ransom.

192
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,752
Exactly.
Right.

193
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,824
So, you know in this case,
somebody must be pretty scared
right now, don't you think?

194
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,063
Might be anxious to settle quick.

195
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,799
Possibly.
Sure.

196
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:51,365
You know, and since
you're the first person
they might try to contact...

197
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:56,070
I'll tell you what.
You give me your telephone number...

198
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,141
and I'll put a tap on your phone
and we'll monitor all your calls.

199
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,551
You wouldn't mind that, would you?

200
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,121
Of course not.
Why should I?

201
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:14,259
Gee, thank you very much.

That's just free-floating anxiety, dear.
Now, relax. Everything's going just...

285
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:26,901
I'm terribly sorry.
No, I simply don't have time.

286
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:33,208
Well, Lieutenant.
Gee, I wish you wouldn't hang up
like that, Mr. Kingston.

287
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,610
I mean, somebody you don't know
tries to call...
Lieutenant,

288
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:39,674
I get a dozen calls a day
just like that from would-be artists,

289
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:44,085
from ladies who want to evaluate some
stupid, little print their maiden aunts
left them in their attic.

290
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,647
If I paid attention to
every one of'em...
You mean, that was a woman?

291
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,718
Yes, and it wasn't any ransom call
if that's what you're thinking.

292
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:55,961
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a museum to go to,
then a dinner, then a lecture.

293
00:28:56,034 --> 00:29:00,528
Well, I was hoping that
we could have a little time to talk.
We can get together later if you'd like.

294
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,733
[Loud Exhale]
No, I've gotta
take my makeup off anyway.

295
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:09,303
May as well do it now.
Follow me.
Fine. Thank you very much.

296
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:13,044
Uh, so this is
a television studio, huh?
Yes.

297
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,348
Quite a place.
Well, it's a barn, really.

298
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,856
I'm sure it's not as glamorous
as you'd thought it'd be.
That's right. It isn't.

299
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:22,087
But things aren't really
what they seem to be, are they?

300
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,323
My, how observant you are.

301
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:29,424
Hildy, my beauty,
how fast do you think
we can get this paint off me?

302
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,436
I'll use high-speed turpentine.

303
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:36,497
Well, anyway, uh,
I'm sorry to bother you here,
but you haven't been home much.

304
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:41,069
Now that's too bad in a way.
That tap on your phone,
it's not helping us any.

305
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,478
I'm not
your only possibility, Lieutenant.

306
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,711
I don't know whether
you know this,
but my uncle was married once.

307
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,380
In fact, his ex-wife still lists
herself in the phone book
under her married name.

308
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,289
So, you see, whoever took
those paintings could very well be
trying to contact her.

309
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,695
You know, somebody mentioned that.
So I saw Mrs. Mathews this morning.
We're watching her phone too.

310
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:02,097
[Chuckling]
Oh, that must have been
some interview.

311
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,398
Aunt Edna can be
a bit trying.
I thought she was kind of nice.

312
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,462
Oh, she's very nice,
but, uh, trying.

313
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:13,375
Well, you said you had
some questions you wanted to ask me?

314
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:16,903
Yeah. Nothing important,
just a few details.

315
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,145
Like that backdoor thing.
That really bothers me.
What about it?

316
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:24,382
Um, does that coffee machine work?
Yes, of course it does.
What about it?

317
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:30,122
Well, you know, the lab says that
there was just no way for that lock
to be forced from the outside.

318
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,686
Thank you, Hildy. So?

319
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,426
Would you like a coffee?
No, thanks.

320
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,333
Well, how did anyone get in?

321
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:43,238
You see, Evans is positive that
all the doors were locked
when he left the house earlier.

322
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:47,472
And I don't see your uncle
letting anyone in, unless he knew 'em.

323
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:55,650
Did you come all this way
just to tell <i>me</i> that?

324
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,054
Well, I thought you'd be interested.
Like, I did clear up one routine thing.

325
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:04,289
<i>You know that gallery</i>
<i>you went to? Checked out.</i>
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

326
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,455
Well, that's your job. And?

327
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,023
The parking lot boy, he remembered
when you got there all right.

328
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,764
So that if Mr. Mathews
was killed at 11:00,
then you sure didn't do it.

329
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:18,466
Now isn't that a shame, Lieutenant?

330
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,479
And here I am your best
and most obvious suspect too.
[Tsking]

331
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,574
Aw, don't say things like that.
Really, you've got me all wrong.

332
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:30,849
Oh, yeah.
<i>It's just that I get bugged by</i>
<i>those little things.</i>

333
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,856
Like, no connection.

334
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:37,190
But why would a person look in
the trunk of a car
for a missing cuff link?

<i>[Brush Clatters On Vanity]</i>
'Cause I happened to toss
my topcoat in there...

336
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,693
in order to
keep it from getting stolen.

337
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:47,101
- Then I noticed that the link
was missing.
- Of course.

338
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,333
See, I could've guessed that.

339
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,400
A little while later I found the link
caught in the lining of my sleeve.

340
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,207
I'm gonna tell you somethir.

341
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:00,047
Do you know that there is
a reasonable explanation for everything
if you just put your mind to it?

she don't even remember
what time she went to bed last night.

Well, being sober
might help, I suppose.

349
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,775
Now, with you, Mr. Kingston,
it's just the opposite. Very unusual.

350
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:32,010
With you, we know exactly
where you were and when.

Not only that,
we know your whole car was empty.

353
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:45,560
Well, if you'll excuse me.
Mm. Oh, listen, by the way,
can I show you something?

354

It's only gonna take a second.
Uh, you can rent paintings,
did you know that?

00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,868
Yes, I know.
And my father-in-law,
he loves Western movies,

But you know, then I say,

go there last night
if this guy's stuff is so bad?

when I write hostile reviews
about hacks like Sam Franklin.

No. Just to ask you something
about art.

You said you had some books
and things there that I could see.

anything about...

to my apartment? You may simply
leave it under the mat when you leave.

423
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,861
So if you'll excuse me.
Oh, of course.

424
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,261
I'll get out of your hair.
I'm-I'm awfully sorry about this.

425
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,164
Did you pick up something interesting?

426
00:38:56,234 --> 00:39:01,570
Uh, no, just some, um,
insipid watercolors that
these people want me to evaluate.

427
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,901
Watercolors?
Yes.

428
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:06,603
I was just looking at watercolors.
Matisse? Wonderful.

429
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,908
I'd love to hear
what you had to say about him.

430
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,813
Could we take just a moment...
No... Lieutenant, please!

431
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:14,477
If you don't mind, I...
Oh.

432
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:17,020
It's quite late.
I'm-I'm quite exhausted.
Some other time, please.

433
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,716
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course.
I should've realized.
<i>[Telephone Ringing]</i>

434
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,225
I just got so caught up
in this art thing...
My phone. My phone, Lieutenant.

435
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,921
Your phone?
My phone.

436
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:28,557
Oh.
It, uh, just might be
people about the ransom.

437
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,625
Oh. By all means.

438
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:37,965
Hello? Yes.

439
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,443
Yes, he is. Just a moment.
It's for you.

440
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,912
I told 'em at the office
that I might stop by.

441
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:46,974
Thank you very much.
It's all right.

442
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,680
Yeah? What?

443
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,656
Well, where was it?

444
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,661
Yes, I understand,
but why are you calling me for?

445
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,892
Oh. Okay, I'll be right down.

446
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,024
<i>Mmm.</i>

447
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,264
Listen, I'm sorry.
I gotta run.

448
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,430
<i>Gee, it's always somethir.</i>

449
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:13,136
This highway patrolman,
he found a girl in a car.

450
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,771
Ran over a cliff to Malibu Canyon.

451
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:18,782
Dead.

452
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,978
You get all sorts of cases,
don't you?
Yeah, listen.

453
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,817
They won't let me live.
What are you gonna do?

454
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,881
Uh, I'm sorry.
L-I didn't mean to fall asleep here.

455
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,950
I hope I didn't bother you too much.
It's all right.

456
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,019
Get some rest.

457
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,023
<i>[Columbo]</i>
<i>Mrs. Mathews?</i>

458
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,459
Oh, Lieutenant Columbo!
How are ya?

459
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,463
I'm fine.
Good. Listen,

460
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:09,091
Mr. Kingston and the attorney
said it was all right
if I dropped by.

461
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,728
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no! Of course not.

462
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,864
The more, the merrier.
But it...

463
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,468
it does seem such a shame
to hear poor Rudy this way.

464
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,706
All those ' whereases."

465
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,873
It won't sound like him at all.

466
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:28,146
You know, lawyers
always have a way of makir...
It's like an old movie...

467
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,518
with all the barristers
and the butlers
and the discarded wives...

468
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:35,582
all gathering together
in the library to hear the will read.

469
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,651
Oh! Perhaps we'd better go.

470
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,390
<i>It's never bothered me</i>
<i>till just about two months ago.</i>

471
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:44,799
Really? You know, I have a friend...
He wasn't always
a very nice man, you know.

472
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,269
Just business, business, business.

473
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,363
And then collecting.
Oh!

474
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,874
Collecting like some old pack rat.

475
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:55,709
But how anyone
could want to kill Rudy, I...

476
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,248
Oh, hello, Dale.
Edna, darling.

477
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,341
How are you?
Hello, Lieutenant.

478
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:03,444
Mr. Kingston.
What have you got there this time,
a pink rabbit?

479
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,422
Oh, this? No, no, not really.
But it is something
that I wanted to show you.

480
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:08,721
Oh, show me too.
Edna, my dear.

481
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,385
Frank.
Dale.

482
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,362
And Lt. Columbo.
We can begin now.

483
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,365
Mr. Evans and his wife
are here already.

484
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:18,163
But Lieutenant was just going
to show us...
Never mind. He'll show me.

485
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:20,466
We'll join you in a little while.
Thank you, Frank.

486
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,530
I hope you're feeling better, Edna.

487
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,876
What do you think?

488
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,248
It's frightful.
That's what I figured.

489
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:37,879
But you know what?
I thought maybe you just might
recognize the style or the signature.

490
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,621
No.
Who on earth is Tracy?

491
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:46,424
Well, do you remember the other night
when I had to leave your place in a hurry?

492
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:50,194
Oh, yes, that highway patrol thing.
Some kind of an accident, wasn't it?

493
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,702
That's what it looked like.
But you see, I told...

494
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:57,230
I said whenever a case comes up
that has anything to do
with art or painting, you call me.

495
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,242
Now, wait a minute.
You mean it wasn't an accident?

496
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,337
Oh, yeah, it's an accident.
I mean, that's what it's listed as.

497
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:07,009
But, anyway, you see, the dead girl,
she was some kind of an art student.

498
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,645
And I thought, well, who knows,
maybe you knew something about her.

499
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,655
Tracy O'Connor?

500
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,283
[Laughing]

501
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,558
Lieutenant, there must be
over 100,000 art students
in Southern California.

502
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:25,466
Well, you see,
I remember seeir one of those
lecture schedules in your apartment.

503
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:29,939
And a couple of months ago,
you gave several lectures
in the school where this girl was enrolled.

504
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,942
This is what she looks like.
Be realistic, Lieutenant.

505
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,912
You think I can remember
everyone who ever sat in
on one of my lectures?

506
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:43,280
I've never seen that girl before
in my life. Why don't you stop
wasting everybody's time?

507
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,720
<i>These are all minor details.</i>

508
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,588
Sit down, Dale, won't you?
Thank you, Frank.

509
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,957
'For their devoted service to me...

510

511
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,991
Uh, Lieutenant, why don't you
make yourself comfortable.

512
00:43:57,068 --> 00:44:01,630
We've uh, skimmed over the preliminaries.
We're now down to the salient points.

513
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,901
Proceed as you wish, Counselor.
Mmm.

514
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,944
'For their devoted service to me

L-I'm really sorry.

<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>Don't be silly, Aunt Edna.</i>

534

All it means is that I'll now
be able to criticize your collection
like I used to criticize his.

00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:21,884
Thank you, Frank.
Mm-hmm.

536
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:24,250
Lieutenant.

537
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:29,089
Mrs. Mathews, I hope...
This is just such a surprise.
We are... I'm happy for you.

538
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,527
<i>I know you'll be pleased with it.</i>
<i>I'm sure you will.</i>

539
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,689
I wasn't prepared for that.
Nope. Really is a shock.

540
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:38,531
File those, would you, please?
I tried to talk Rudy out of it, naturally.

541
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:43,238
He always intended to leave
that collection to Dale.

542
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:46,299
Then, give it to her.

543
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:48,811
That's why I thought
you'd like to be here.

544
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,677
Legally, I couldn't say anything until...
Oh, sure. I understand that.

545
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,217
It's just that
that was a new will?

546
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:57,743
<i>Only last month?</i>
That's correct.
He wrote most of it himself.

547
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:02,816
<i>Oh, he promised to let me</i>
<i>draw up something more detailed</i>
<i>and complete later on, but...</i>

548
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,691
Boy, I can't figure it. L...

549
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,129
You'd think the nephew
would get the paintings.

550
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,463
<i>I agree. I agree.</i>

551
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,264
<i>Mr. Mathews had</i>
<i>disagreements with Dale,</i>

552
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:16,602
<i>but an art collection like that</i>
<i>is big business.</i>

553
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:22,476
To manage that requires
specialized skill, taste.

554
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:28,451
<i>Why he'd simply leave the whole thing</i>
<i>to a poor, unstable creature like</i> Ed...

555
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,721
Those comments are hardly
professional of me, are they?

556
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,723
One thing, though.

557
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:38,558
If Mr. Kingston doesn't get the collection,
he at least gets the rest of the estate.
<i>It's meaningless.</i>

558
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,063
He rented that big house.

559
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,430
Rudy disposed of all his business interests.

560
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:46,629
<i>There really isn't any</i>
<i>remaining estate to speak of.</i>

561
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:49,969
Oh.

562
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,770
Well, listen, uh,
thanks for lettir me come down.

563
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:56,108
I gotta get back to work.
<i>Uh, Lieutenant?</i>

564
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:59,649
Your painting.
Oh, thank you very much.

565
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:02,345
Uh, Lieutenant?
My lighter.

566
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,354
Oh.

567
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:06,583
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

568
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,325
[Sighs]
Miss Henderson,
I'll make my calls now, please.

569
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,833
<i>[Kingston]</i>
<i>Looking for me, Lieutenant?</i>

570
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:25,308
Oh. Yeah, I thought
I'd kind of catch you
out in the parking lot.

571
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:29,904
Expect you'd find me there
kicking my tires in frustration,
I suppose?

572
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,883
Well, I thought there'd be
the normal amount of disappointment.
You are so transparent, Columbo.

573
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:38,479
You had this thing all figured out
right from the start, haven't you?

574
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:42,822
Dale Kingston hired someone
to fake the theft and kill his uncle.

575
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:46,090
Maybe even some
poor little art student, perhaps.

576
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:50,964
Mr. Kingston, I never said that.
And even though I had
an ain'tight alibi by total accident,

577
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:54,163
at the time of my uncle's murder,
that still didn't stop you, did it?

578
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,263
Mr. Kingston, really, I...
Well, at this point,

579
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,071
I'm sure that even a compulsively
suspicious bureaucrat like you...

580
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:03,238
<i>must have his doubts</i>
<i>about my guilt.</i>

581
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:05,248
<i>Because you heard it up there,</i>
<i>Mr. Columbo.</i>

582
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:10,344
You heard it in plain English.
I do not inerit.

583
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:13,356
<i>Edna does.</i>
That's very true, Mr. Kingston.

584
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:17,986
That's very true, except...
<i>Except what?</i>

585
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:22,158
Well, maybe you didn't know that
your uncle changed his will.

586
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:26,533
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that,

587
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:28,697
because, you see,
I've known for more than 10 days...

588
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,208
<i>that I couldn't possibly inerit</i>
<i>any part of that collection.</i>

589
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:35,939
But since you won't believe me,
maybe you'll believe my uncle.

590
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,208
Go on. I'm sure
somebody in your department...

591
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,685
is capable of verifying
that signature.

592
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,052
Go on, read it.

593
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:49,581
He sent me that letter 10 days ago
telling me about the new will.

594
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,685
<i>Look at the postmark.</i>

595
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:58,831
- So you did know?
- Of course I knew.

596
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:02,202
Now, would you please
do me a favor
and stop pestering me...

597
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:06,334
and go on out and do what you
should've done in the first place, huh?

598
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,776
Find the real killer!

599
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:31,399
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Lieutenant, I'm not a busybody.</i>
<i>I never said that.</i>

600
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:36,303
Yeah, well, some landlords
like to pry into the lives
of their tenants, but not me.

601
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,568
My policy is live and let live.

602
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:43,341
Come on. What's bothering Walter?
He won't eat?
Well, maybe he's not hungry.

603
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:47,578
Listen, it's not that you're a busybody.
You live here and you see things.

604
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,246
I mean, how can you live here
and not see things?
Such as?

605
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,382
Well, who goes out with who
and who's doing what.
All those things.

606
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,517
Oh.
This girl, Tracy O'Connor,
who did she go out with?

607
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:59,825
Come on. Tell me.
She dated, didn't she?
Oh, of course she dated.

608
00:49:59,897 --> 00:50:02,593
Oh, you know, that was
a terrible shame about that accident.

609
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,191
That was a very talented girl.
Very.

610
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,703
Well, you oughta know.
You took one of her paintings
the last time you were here.

611
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,035
She was a very gifted girl.
You're darn right.

612
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,837
And it was a shame about the accident.
Right.

613
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,606
You know why I hated
to give up the painting?
Well, why did you give it up?

614
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,613
I had to.
What for?

615
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:21,447
Well, that was evidence.
Evidence for what?

616
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,715
Listen, I don't wanna get into that.
That's too complicated.
Walter, come here.

617
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,382
Come here, boy.
Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't do that!

618
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,449
Why not?
Walter doesn't like strangers.
He'll bite.

619
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,962
Will he? Oh.
It was an accident, wasn't it?

620
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,999
Listen, are you gonna tell me
about the men in her life or not?

621
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:40,765
All right, the men.
Now, remember,

622
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,238
I wasn't particularly trying
to find out about her,

623
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:46,276
but I do remember one or two.

624
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:50,712
There was an actor fella.
There were a couple
of those beach types.

625
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,215
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
And there was a kid that played...

626
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,410
You want me to tell you the truth?
Yeah.

627
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:58,284
I'm interested in one guy in particular.
Who?

628
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:02,223
Forty years old, well dressed,
distinguished.

629
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,226
Wait a minute.
Now, wait a minute.

630
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:07,559
Come to think of it,
there was one older gentleman
she was seeing.

631
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,498
Really? Can you describe him?

632
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,501
Would a picture help?

633
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,265
A picture?
Are ya kidding?
Mm-mmm.

634
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:18,172
You have a picture of this fella?
Yeah, it's around here someplace
if I haven't thrown it away.

635
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,176
It's probably in my album.

636
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,178
Where did you get a photograph of him?

637
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:25,647
Well, I was taking
some snapshots of my nephew
out at the pool.

638
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:29,482
And Tracy and her friend
were out there,
so I took one of them too.

639
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,249
I'm sure it's in one of these.
You're a lifesaver.

640
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,654
Well, let's see.

641
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:40,021
Oh! Here was one.
That's when my cousins
were out here from Milwaukee.

642
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,225
We stopped at one of those
roadside stands, you know,
for date malts.

643
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,167
Oh, I got so sick,
but they're awful good.
Have you ever had one?

644
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,295
Think you'd like 'em.

645
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,567
Oh, there's Cindy Lou.
That's my cousirs kid.

646
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:53,633
She's named for me. Look at her.
That's at Graumars Chinese.

647
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:57,169
She's trying to fit her feet into the...
you know, the things in the concrete.

648
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,272
That's awful cute.
I made her that dress.

649
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:02,011
Doesn't that look nice?
Um...

650
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,213
Can you see...
Well, let's see, now.

651
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:08,122
Oh! Here's a whole bunch of us
that went out to the family plot
and had a picnic.

652
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:10,990
We did some weeding and planting.
We had the best time.
[Clears Throat]

653
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,859
We had more laughs...
Look, isn't that cute?
That's my Uncle Henry there.

654
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:15,865
Oh.
Now, wait a minute.
We must...

655
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:18,333
Do you have any...
That's a nice one too. Look at that.
That was taken at the zoo.

656
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:21,337
Isn't that a good one of a lion?
Wonderful. Do you have any idea...

657
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:25,603
Now, wait a minute.
Oh-oh, here it is. Here you go.
There. Well, there he is.

658
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:33,475
That's the one.
Any help? No kidding?

659
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,848
That's not him.
Oh, I'm sorry.

660
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,415
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>You guys still guarding this place?</i>

661
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,652
<i>[Gardener]</i>
<i>Just me. I keep the tourists away.</i>

662
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:47,060
Say, uh, you know anything
about aphids?

663
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:49,895
Aphids?
Yeah, they're destroying my roses.

664
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:53,562
My wife doesn't want me
to use any pesticides.
Hmm.

665
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:57,596
Hard spray from your garden hose
around 4:00 or 5:00 p.m.

666
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,541
Uh, the surs still hot enough
to dry,

667
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,705
and it won't burn your flowers.

668
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:06,306
Just water, huh?

669
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,511
Thanks. I'll try it.
Okay.

670
00:53:15,459 --> 00:53:18,792
Hey! Come here!

671
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,227
Look at this!

672
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:42,251
Your ex-husband lived
right up there, didn't he?

673
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,152
Uh, y-yes, right up there on the hill,

674
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,453
brooding down on me like Zeus.

675
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:52,222
When we were married,
I always used to like this house.

676
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:54,764
As soon as we got divorced,
I moved in.

677
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:59,735
But for years, Rudy and I couldn't
have been farther away from each other...

678
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,397
if I'd bought a house on the Moon.

679
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,440
Are you sure
you wouldn't like a drink?
Oh, no.

680
00:54:04,508 --> 00:54:06,669
Thank you very much.
Are they real?

681
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,335
Yes.
May I?

682
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,744
Oh, of course.
Help yourself.
Thank you.

683
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,839
So, uh, what changed all that?

684
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,680
I mean, how did you and Rudy
get to seeing one another again?

685
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:20,086
Well, we just bumped into each other
a couple of months ago.

686
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:24,651
<i>And, well, we were older...</i>

687
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,925
<i>and he wasn't</i>
<i>quite so stuffy anymore.</i>

688
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:31,456
And maybe I don't throw things...

689
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:34,561
like parties and handsome Italians
quite so much.

690
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:37,471
Ma'am, I know you're in a hurry.
You wanna go shopping.

691
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,634
But I wondered first
if we could talk about...

692
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,373
<i>But you want to know</i>
<i>about that will thing.</i>

693
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:46,644
Of course.
L-I don't blame you.

694
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:49,811
Uh, but don't misunderstand.

695
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:52,685
<i>Rudy and I werert starting...</i>

696
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,919
<i>to sing September songs</i>
<i>or anything like that.</i>

697
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:57,927
But...

698
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:00,828
Well, you see, years ago...

699
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:03,526
I used to think I was artistic,

700
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,728
and I literally dragged him
into his first museum.

701
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:10,569
<i>And that's how</i>
<i>his whole collection all began.</i>

702
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:15,908
Because naturally, Rudy started
sensing a good investment area.

703
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:20,313
And some of the paintings
I liked werert too bad.

704
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:24,445
But it was my understanding that
it was his nephew
who picked out all his paintings.

705
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,422
Oh, yes, later on.

706
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,051
But Dale was just in college then.

707
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:35,190
Uh, that was just about the time when...

708
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:39,099
when I started misbehaving.

709
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:43,970
And then, of course,
after our divorce, the collection
became an obsession with Rudy...

710
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:46,202
and a whole career for Dale.

711
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:50,269
So since you were in at the beginning,
Mr. Mathews last month decided
to leave the whole collection to you?

712
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,838
But he didn't want me to keep them.

713
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,885
<i>You don't think that, do you?</i>
Well...

714
00:55:55,953 --> 00:56:01,118
Oh, dear.
I guess nobody's going to understand.

715
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,887
[Stammering]
No. You see,

716
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:08,455
poor Rudy was finally tired of it,
that's all...

717
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:12,468
all the greedy buying
and bidding and hoarding.

718
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:15,505
He finally...
He finally agreed with me...

719
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:20,635
that the people should own
those lovely things
instead of just collectors.

720
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:24,807
<i>He decided to give them all away...</i>

721
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,815
<i>to schools, museums.</i>

722
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:30,114
Oh! But, oh, dear,

723
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:33,850
it takes so much time to work that out...

724
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:37,257
to decide which places
get which.

725
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:40,592
And in the meantime, he didn't want
Dale Kingston to get his hands on it.
Is that it?

726
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:42,655
<i>I don't like to say that.</i>

727
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:48,171
I was just so happy that
Rudy was finally turning human.

728
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,729
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

729
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,105
Who on Earth...

730
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:01,647
Hello, Aunt Edna. May I come in?
How are you, dear?

731
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:05,677
<i>I didn't think you'd even remember</i>
<i>where I lived.</i>

732
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,556
Of course I do.
Got a message from a Lt. Col...

733
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:12,686
Oh, there you are.
What's this all about?

734
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,856
Is it about the gun?
What?

735
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,832
Wait a minute.
What gun? What is all this?

736
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,461
Well, I thought you'd be interested.
About a half hour ago,

737
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:23,005
a gardener up on that hill there,

738
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:25,371
he found a.38 revolver,

739
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:29,538
and it's the same kind as the one
that was missing from your uncle's desk.

740
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,945
Uh, may I use your phone?

741
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,381
Oh, yes, of course.

742
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,978
Isn't that silly?
Right up above my house.

743
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:41,684
L-I've walked on that hill myself.

744
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,463
Ballistics.

745
00:57:48,532 --> 00:57:51,660
Is this Charlie?
Lt. Columbo.

746
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:55,671
Charlie, I sent that stuff over there
over a half hour ago...

747
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:59,334
Oh. Thank you.

748
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:05,245
- It's the murder gun, all right.
- Oh.

749
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,715
Oh, there's nothing to be upset about.

750
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:10,753
<i>[Edna]</i>
<i>But I was just telling Dale,</i>

751
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:14,257
l-I go up there myself
when I want a breath of air.

752
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,191
I even walked over to see Rudy
just the night before he was killed.

753
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,194
Aunt Edna, I don't think
you oughta say another word.

754
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:22,459
<i>The lieutenant may get</i>
<i>the wrong idea.</i>
<i>What?</i>

755
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:27,964
Oh, but-but surely
no one would think that I...

756
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:31,667
Threw that gun there?
Oh, no, Mrs. Mathews.
No, no, no, no, no.

757
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,266
<i>No, you see,</i>
<i>I finally figured out what happened.</i>

758
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:38,804
Whoever was in that house that night,
they ran out the back.
They just kept on going.

759
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,783
Well, naturally, they were anxious
to get rid of your ex-husband's gun.

760
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,843
<i>It could've been anybody.</i>

761
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,684
It could?
<i>Yes. Absolutely, it could.</i>

762
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:50,385
You have nothing to worry about.
Now, did you wanna go shopping?

763
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:56,888
Well, I was planning to meet
some friends at the fashion center,
but I can do that some other time.

764
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:58,992
No, I want you to go right ahead,

765
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:01,037
and I want you
to forget about all this.

766
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:04,267
Just do what my wife does,
'cause when she hits
a department store,

767
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:09,005
she can forget anything,
even the fact that
I'm sittir outside waiting.

768
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,343
Have a good time, Edna.
Bye.

769
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:19,149
What are you trying to do to her?

770
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,622
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
Well, you know perfectly well...

771
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:24,159
that it was a woman that ran out
of that place that night.

772
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,754
You said so yourself.
Yeah, sure, but not her.

773
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:30,265
Oh, I hope
you really mean that, Lieutenant...

774
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,927
that you're not just playing
some kind of a game with her.

775
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:34,937
A game?
Yes. You know what I mean.

776
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:38,634
Lulling her into
a sense of false security.
Edna's a very vulnerable woman.

777
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:42,405
Mr. Kingston,
you've got me all wrong, really.
I wouldn't think of a thing like that.

778
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:46,438
That lady wouldn't hurt a fly.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Lieutenant?</i>

779
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:49,314
Can you come around here for a minute?

780
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,246
You told me not to bother you
until she'd gone.

781
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,554
What is it?
Well, we found something else.

782
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:59,561
She's got some trash cans back here.

783
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:05,798
'Rudy Mathews,
417 Pine View."

784
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:10,533
<i>Looks like that piece of wrapping paper</i>
<i>that was torn from the rest of it</i>
<i>in his house. Remember?</i>

785
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,041
<i>We figured the thief used it.</i>

786
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:17,136
All right, you'd better
get that down for fingerprinting
and comparison with the other paper.

787
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:19,148
<i>Is there anything else?</i>

788
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:22,208
No, we've covered
every inch of the grounds.

789
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:25,118
Be careful with that.

790
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:33,060
Now what?
I don't know.

791
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,927
I know what you're thinking, Lieutenant.

792
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:39,400
The gun,
and now this new evidence.

793
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,438
Looks pretty bad for her.
Yes, it does. Yes.

794
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:46,669
I'm still convinced that Edna
had absolutely nothing to do with this.

795
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,610
You know,
I think I agree with ya.

796
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,341
Look at it this way.
If she's really guilty,

797
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:55,543
she's not gonna put that paper
in a garbage can, is she?

798
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:58,417
I mean, she's probably gonna
burn it in the fireplace or somethir.

799
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:01,788
Yes, exactly.
That's the point.

800
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:06,295
And you know something else,
Mr. Kingston?
You're absolutely right about her.

801
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:08,354
She's a...
What did you call it before?

802
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:11,628
Vulnerable.
Vulnerable, yes.
She's a vulnerable woman.

803
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:14,295
And I'm afraid that
if I press her too hard,

804
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,669
she'll fall apart.
Oh, yes.

805
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,766
And I sure don't wanna make
the same mistake
that I made with you.

806
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:23,745
No, sir.
What I'm gonna do is this.

807
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:28,648
I'm gonna sit on everything
until those stolen paintings show up.
I see.

808
01:01:31,588 --> 01:01:35,490
- I mean, that's the best way
to handle it, don't you think?
- Yes, yes, of course.

809
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:43,231
I mean, I don't wanna go around
pointing my finger at anyone
until I have an ain'tight case.

810
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,929
- Right?
- Right.

811
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,299
Uh, Lieutenant,

812
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:55,970
your man said that you'd, uh...
you'd covered every...
every inch of the place here.

813
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:59,345
<i>Did that include the inside of the house?</i>
Well, she gave us permission,
but I don't wanna bother.

814
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,384
Well, don't you think you should?

815
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:03,510
I mean, for her protection.

816
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:06,953
And when you fail to find the paintings,
you can cross her name off the list entirely.

817
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:10,151
Well, it hardly seems won'th the trouble.
Neither of us thinks she's guilty.
Why bother?

818
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:14,560
Well, for her sake so she can be certain.
Search the house, Lieutenant.

819
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:17,327
No, really,
I think it's a waste of time.

820
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,029
<i>But if anything new comes up,</i>
<i>I'll let you know.</i>
<i>[Starts Engine]</i>

821
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:32,210
Edna? She's utterly harmless.

822
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:35,251
Exactly.
That's why we've got to help her.

823
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,582
But is there really
any danger of her arrest?

824
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:39,884
You told me yourself
the lieutenant doesn't think she's guilty.

825
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:42,789
That's today, Frank.
Who knows what he'll think tomorrow?

826
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:46,761
In case you haven't noticed,
he is a very haphazard individual.

827
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:51,062
Hmm. And if he doesn't
break the case soon?
Exactly.

828
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:55,571
He starts looking for a scapegoat
because the pressure's
building up on him,

829
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:58,698
and Edna's the most
obvious candidate.

830
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:03,007
Well, what should we do?

831
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:08,449
Protect her.
I'm sure Rudy would've wanted
both of us to look out for her interests.

832
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,078
She trusts you, Frank.

833
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:15,523
Get her in here.
Talk to her like a Dutch uncle.
Fill her in on the situation.

834
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:19,187
You're sure we should
allow her house to be searched?

835
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:22,720
Absolutely. In fact,
I think you ought to recommend
that we insist on it.

836
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,326
And that way, we get it on the record
that nothing has been found
to incriminate her.

837
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:33,099
All right. Miss Henderson,
get me Mrs. Mathews.

838
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:36,771
Oh, uh, she's shopping
at the fashion center in Beverly Hills.

839
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,838
You could bring her in here right now
and clarify this whole thing.

840
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:46,945
Miss Henderson, have her paged
at the fashion center.
We'll clear it up today.

841
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:52,552
Well, there may be
one small hitch to that.

842
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:55,496
Unfortunately, Lt. Columbo
refuses to search the house.

843
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:59,057
He claims it to be a waste of time.
<i>Oh?</i>

844
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:02,730
Which merely perpetuates
Edna's anxiety.

845
01:04:02,806 --> 01:04:05,639
I really wish there was something
we could do about that man, Frank.

846
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:10,641
Well, perhaps there's, um,
some way around him.

847
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,874
You really think so?

848
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:16,385
I have a few friends at city hall.
Let me look into it.

849
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:18,751
Fine. Thank you.

850
01:04:18,822 --> 01:04:21,916
I'll just run one little errand,
and I'll be right back.

851
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,357
<i>Fine. Fine.</i>
<i>Uh, Miss Henderson,</i>

852
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:27,828
<i>after I talk to Mrs. Mathews,</i>
<i>I want the police department.</i>

853
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,831
<i>Dale?</i>

854
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,833
Edna does have an excellent motive.

855
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:37,066
You, uh... You don't think
there's any chance...

856
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,473
Of course not.

857
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,636
You oughta be ashamed of yourself, Frank.

858
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,711
Yeah. Sorry.

859
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,817
I just don't understand any of this.

860
01:06:30,887 --> 01:06:34,118
It's just a precautionary measure,
Aunt Edna, nothing more.

861
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,557
But what do you want them
to search my house for?

862
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:41,495
What will they find?
Absolutely nothing.
That's just the point.

863
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:43,498
Now, come on.

864
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:47,929
Frank.
Mm-hmm.

865
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,938
Where, uh...
Where do you want me to put these?

866
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,338
Oh, uh, in there.

867
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:55,377
Anywhere.
Oh, I need a drink.

868
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:58,778
Of course you do, darling.
So do I. Let me fix it for you.

869
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,873
Here are your keys.

870
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,145
<i>Still scotch?</i>
Yes.

871
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:06,552
<i>How about you, Frank?</i>
<i>A drink?</i>
Yes, on the rocks, please.

872
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:10,684
I'm sorry we have to
put you through this now.
But believe me,

873
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,694
<i>it'll all be over soon, huh?</i>

874
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:17,722
Why would anyone think that
I'd want to kill Rudy?
<i>Nobody does.</i>

875
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,065
We just wanna make sure
that it stays that way, that's all.

876
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:24,163
That's why Frank is having the police
come in and search the house.

877
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,606
<i>Believe me, it's all for the best.</i>

878
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:30,407
Dale, I don't even remember
what happened...

879
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,744
the night Rudy was killed.

880
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:36,581
I get so nervous,
l-I take sleeping pills sometimes.

881
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:38,917
- That's one thing you should...
[Yells]
- Oh!

882
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:41,752
Oh! Excuse me.
Oh!

883
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,951
Let me just dry off.
I'll be right back.

884
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:46,222
Oh!

885
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,524
<i>[Edna]</i>
<i>Oh, isn't that a shame?</i>

886
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,864
<i>Uh, Frank...</i>

887
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:32,875
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

888
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:38,575
Frank, must we go through this?

889
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:40,912
Edna, you will be
so much better off...

890
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,246
- <i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>
- Come on. Come on.

891
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,216
Nothing to be nervous about now.

892
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,351
Go ahead.

893
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:58,466
Miss Mathews?
Captain Wyler, police department.

894
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,230
<i>[Edna]</i>
<i>Yes. Please, come in.</i>

895
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,329
<i>[Wyler]</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

896
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,682
Sorry. You can't go in there.

897
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,054
<i>[Columbo]</i>
<i>I'm a lieutenant,</i>
<i>so, do you mind?</i>

898
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,252
It's okay, Ferguson.
Let him in.

899
01:10:00,096 --> 01:10:02,792
Hi, Captain.
Columbo.

900
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:06,028
Uh... Oh, hi, Mr. Kingston.
Hello, Lieutenant.

901
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:10,436
Listen, I just heard about this.
Word came down from above
to have the place searched.

902
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:14,602
Is that so?
Yeah. And I can't
understand why.

903
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:19,011
The fact is,
I was kind of bypassed
when I came over here.

904
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:21,208
Well, apparently you're
just not needed here then, Lieutenant.

905
01:10:21,284 --> 01:10:23,479
Why don't you just go home
and have your dinner?

906
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,783
Oh, no, I'd better hang around,
because, you know,

907
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:28,949
if I leave now,
it looks bad upstairs, you know.

908
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:31,016
Mmm.

909
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,855
Oh, hello, Mrs. Mathews.
Mr. Simpson.
<i>Hi.</i>

910
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:40,630
Gee, I hope this is not
upsetting you too much.

911
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:43,501
Well, I'm not very happy...

912
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,803
<i>about my house</i>
<i>being torn apart.</i>

913
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:49,174
- <i>But they advised me to do it.</i>
- They?

914
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:53,511
- <i>Who is "they"?</i>
- Mr. Kingston and I
thought it was necessary, Lieutenant.

915
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,881
Oh, I see.
Oh.

916
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:59,115
It's really very confusing.

917
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:04,592
You said you didn't suspect me
of anything, didn't you?

918
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,821
Yes, I did, ma'am,
and I meant that.

919
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,887
And, actually,
I was opposed to...
Captain Wyler.

920
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:16,161
Clear this table.

921
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:27,107
Where'd you find those?

922
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:29,242
Linen closet in the hallway.

923
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:33,653
<i>Edna, how could you?</i>

924
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:37,921
<i>[Gasps]</i>
<i>Dale, believe me,</i>

925
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:40,622
I have no idea how they got there!

926
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:44,997
- You'd better not say another word.
- But...

927
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,900
Edna, he's right.

928
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,165
Do you intend
to charge her formally, Captain?

929
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,764
It's up to Lt. Columbo.
It's his case.

930
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:54,776
<i>What do you mean it's his case?</i>
<i>I thought it was...</i>

931
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:57,074
<i>We know what you thought,</i>
<i>Mr. Kingston.</i>

932
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:00,548
Lieutenant?

933
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:04,609
Well, I think we can
get started with the fingerprinting.
Let's get the kit.

934
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:11,390
Careful, there.
Be very careful.

935
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,086
Gee, they're something,
aren't they?

936
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,325
Pastels, you know.

937
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,164
May I ask
what this is all about, Lieutenant?

938
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:22,329
Both of'em.
<i>Lieutenant?</i>

939
01:12:22,405 --> 01:12:26,466
Oh, Mr. Kingston.
Uh, yes, just give us a moment, please.
Do you mind?

940
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,204
We're getting a few.
Good.

941
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:32,270
I'd like an answer, if you don't mind.

942
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:37,285
Uh, well, I'd have to start
with your uncle's will.

943
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,719
What about it?

944
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:43,281
Well, you see, he pulled a rug
out from under you when
he left his collection to Mrs. Mathews.

945
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,953
So you only had
one thing that you could do...

946
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:49,464
murder him and blame it on her.

947
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:58,172
I hope you realize the full import
of what you're saying, Lieutenant.
There are witnesses here.

948
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,367
You see, under the law,

949
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:04,379
anyone who criminally causes
the death of someone else
can't inerit from that person.

950
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:06,381
<i>Is that right, Mr. Simpson?</i>
That's correct.

951
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:12,585
So if Mrs. Mathews is convicted,
you're next in line.

952
01:13:12,655 --> 01:13:16,147
<i>Everything goes to you.</i>
<i>That's why you planted the gun,</i>

953
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,819
and that's why
you planted the wrapping paper,

954
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,828
and that's why
you planted these paintings.

955
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:25,595
<i>Dale! I can't believe it!</i>

956
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:28,000
But you'd like to, wouldn't you?

957
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,630
Get you right off the hook.

958
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:35,837
All right, Lieutenant.
You claimed that I planted these paintings?
Suppose you prove it.

959
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,778
- Can we?
- Yeah.

960
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:41,681
Yeah... with fingerprints.

961
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:46,381
Sorry to disappoint you, Lieutenant.
Fingerprints won't help you at all.

962
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:49,083
My fingerprints are all over
those paintings.

963
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:52,218
My uncle and I unwrapped them
when they came back from the exhibit.
I told you, didn't I?

964
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:55,127
I told you myself.
They're covered with my prints.

965
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:58,030
No, we're not looking for your prints.

966
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,396
What?

967
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:06,874
Do you remember the time
that I was in your apartment,
and you came in with some paintings?

968
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,378
<i>And you said that they were watercolors,</i>
<i>and you wanted to evaluate 'em.</i>

969
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:14,610
And remember I wanted to see 'em,
and you wouldn't let me?
And I even touched 'em.

970
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:20,747
- You touched...
- Yes, my fingerprints
are on those paintings.

971
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:25,494
Now, if Mrs. Mathews is guilty,

972
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:28,496
how could my fingerprints
get on paintings that she stole?

973
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:38,572
Uh, this is entrapment.

974
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:42,110
It's a setup, that's all.

975
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:46,638
You-You-You-You touched
those paintings just now
while I wasn't looking.

976
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:49,513
You saw him do it, didn't you?
You put your prints on those paintings...

977
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,678
while you were bent over watching them
while they were working on it!

978
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:54,484
<i>He touched them!</i>
<i>You touched... You...</i>
