python server test

question 1
naming convention in english  dividend รท divisor = quotient
the following is an api for division 
http://server:port/divide/divisor/?dividend=dividend
returns json
{
 "quotient" :  quotient ,
 "result" : int(quotient) ,
 "modulus": modulus
}
for example  http://server:port/divide/4/?dividend=10 will return
{
 "quotient" :  2.5 ,
 "result" : 2 ,
 "modulus": 2
}
build a tests that will test this api and assert on bugs. the test must be complete enough that running them will give us high certainty that the api is working properly. 

question 2.
Build said api with GAE and test it with test built in question no 1.

question 3
keep results in memcache and take the result from memcache if available

question 4 (continue with the code from question 3)
keep results in datastore and take the result from datastore if available.
