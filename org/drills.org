* Site Reliability Engineering
** >->-> Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)                           :drill:
   is a [discipline] that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to
   [infrastructure] and [operations] problems.
** >->-> The main goals are                                           :drill:
   to create [ultra-scalable] and highly [reliable] software systems.
** >->-> According to Ben Treynor, founder of Google's Site Reliability Team :drill:
   SRE is "what happens when a software engineer is [tasked]
   with [what used to be called] operations."
** >->-> The team was tasked                                          :drill:
   to make Google's sites run [smoothly], efficiently, and more
   [reliably].
** >->-> A site reliability engineer (SRE)                            :drill:
   will [spend up] to 50% of their time doing "ops" related work such
   as [issues], on-call, and manual [intervention].
