A [rolling] stone [gathers no moss]

/This proverb refers to what is well known about mosses and lichens -

/The 'stitch in time' is simply the prompt sewing up of a small hole

The smart way to keep people [passive and obedient] is to strictly limit
the spectrum of [acceptable opinion], but allow very lively debate

system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the
debate.
