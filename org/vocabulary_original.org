   This first one is shamelessly stolen from a presentation I saw at
   Microsoft a few years ago:

   1 Complex solutions to simple problems.
   2 Complex solutions to complex problems.
   3 Simple solutions to complex problems.
   4 Complex problems disappear

   Or, on another axis:

   1 You suck.
   2 You seek the advice of your teammates.
   3 Your teammates seek advice from you.
   4 People on other teams come to you for advice.

   (Never forget that despite 3 and 4, item 1 is still true and item 2 is
   still a good idea.)
   Or, on another axis:

   1 Your can write code.
   2 You can understand your code.
   3 You can fix your code.
   4 You can understand other peoples' code.
   5 You can fix other peoples' code.
   6 You can understand and fix your own code even when you wrote it so
   long ago that it might as well have been written by someone else.

   [Edited to add one more section...] 
   The following is all from a Wikipedia page about Four stages of
   competence. It is actually not about programming specifically, but it
   is a way to look at one's competence in any endeavor. I've found it
   interesting to look at all sorts of skills in these terms:

   1 Unconscious incompetence - The individual does not understand or
   know how to do something and does not necessarily recognize the
   deficit. They may deny the usefulness of the skill. The
   individual must recognize their own incompetence, and the value
   of the new skill, before moving on to the next stage. The length
   of time an individual spends in this stage depends on the
   strength of the stimulus to learn.
   2 Conscious incompetence - Though the individual does not
   understand or know how to do something, he or she does recognize
   the deficit, as well as the value of a new skill in addressing
   the deficit. The making of mistakes can be integral to the
   learning process at this stage.
   3 Conscious competence - The individual understands or knows how
   to do something. However, demonstrating the skill or knowledge
   requires concentration. It may be broken down into steps, and
   there is heavy conscious involvement in executing the new skill.
   4 Unconscious competence - The individual has had so much practice
   with a skill that it has become "second nature" and can be
   performed easily. As a result, the skill can be performed while
   executing another task. The individual may be able to teach it
   to others, depending upon how and when it was learned.

  [2016-06-26 Sun 17:05]

  shirk
  
** увиливать

   verb
   1. уклоняться (dodge, skew, avoid, shrink, evade, shirk)
   2. увиливать (shirk, prevaricate, equivocate, dodge, evade, wriggle out of)
   3. увиливать от работы (shirk, soldier)
   4. саботировать (sabotage, ratten, shirk)

   DEFINITION

   verb
   1. avoid or neglect (a duty or responsibility).
      "their sole motive is to shirk responsibility and rip off the
      company"

   noun
   1. a person who shirks.
      "His status as a shirk would normally render him somewhat of a
      pariah."


   To shirk your responsibilities is to avoid dealing with them — like
   when you watch four consecutive hours of infomercials instead of
   facing your homework.

   A verb is an action word, so it's ironic that the verb shirk
   suggests inaction in the avoidance of work. To shirk carries with it
   a negative connotation of laziness. When Eleanor Roosevelt was asked
   how she conquered her shyness to become a powerful public figure,
   she responded, "I faced each problem as it came along. . . . I never
   tried to shirk. I tried never to evade an issue. When I found I had
   something to do — I just did it." Ah, Eleanor, why can't we all be a
   bit more like you?

  consecutive
  
** последовательный

   adjective
   1. последовательный (consistent, serial, consecutive, successive, sequential, coherent)
   2. следственный (consecutive, inquisitional)

   DEFINITION

   adjective
   1. following continuously.
      "five consecutive months of serious decline"


   If things are consecutive, they happen one after the other with no
   break. If there are five consecutive snowstorms on five consecutive
   days, you'll have to shovel your way out on day six.

   Consecutive comes from the Latin consecutus, meaning "following
   closely" with no gap. Just like those snowstorms — one storm
   happened each day, back to back, for five days in a row. Consecutive
   numbers also follow each other, or advance in the right order. For
   example, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are consecutive numbers. You should
   number the pages on a term paper to keep them consecutive so the
   teacher doesn't get confused.

   To shirk your responsibilities is to avoid dealing with them — like
   when you watch four consecutive hours of infomercials instead of
   facing your homework.

   [Pallid] means pale, or lacking color. It's often used together
   with complexion to describe someone who has a pale face, either due
   to a lack of sunshine or some kind of emotional distress. A
   reclusive author could be [pallid] from spending too much time
   indoors. His books can also be called [pallid] if they're lacking
   in color and excitement.

   'Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South

   inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and
   had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine
   hundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if
   with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and
   there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare
   fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the
   cases had in some instances been bodily removed—by the Morlocks as I
   judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our
   footsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping
   glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very
   quietly took my hand and stood beside me.

   [Stave] comes from the word staff, as in a walking stick. You're most
   likely to encounter the word [stave] if you're learning woodworking.
   If someone "[staves in]" a door, they've broken a hole in it. You also
   might hear the idiom "[stave off]," which means to hold off for a
   short time.

    If we analyze the word [beget], we get the prefix be-, which tends to
    intensify the meaning of the following verb, and get, which means to
    cause something to enter one's possession. The word is usually used
    to refer to having children, although it can be used to refer to
    anything that generates something else — for example, an inspiration
    can [beget] a brilliant idea.

   The hackneyed phrase "[giddy||dizzy] as a schoolgirl" calls forth
   the image of a kid giggling with her friends over some adolescent
   foolishness. [Giddy||careless] has been used to describe someone
   incapable of serious thought or easily excited as far back as the
   sixteenth century. Given that, in modern usage, [giddy||volatile]
   describes someone silly and frivolous, it's interesting to know
   that the Old English source for this word has a slightly darker
   tinge: gidig means "insane" or "god-possessed."

  adverb
  1. горячо (hot, fervently, heatedly, ardently, passionately, eagerly)
  2. пылко (fervently, ardently, fervidly)
  3. ревностно (fervently)


  If you fervently believe or feel something, then you believe or feel
  it strongly — with a lot of passion.

  People feel fervently about a lot of things. A sports fan may be
  fervently supportive of a football or basketball team and go to every
  game. Many religious people fervently believe in a god. If you're
  extremely self-confident, you might fervently believe in
  yourself. This word means a lot of passion is present. If you feel
  blah about something, or you just like it a little, you don't
  fervently believe in it.

  But there were days I fervently wished for life before him. There were
  days we'd broke down about it. There were nights I didn't want to get
  up and walk the little guy back to sleep. And only until I accepted
  and went through these things, did I find the joy and peace of my
  situation. As he gets older, I slowly regain some freedoms I used to
  have, and now I can thoroughly appreciate them, unlike before when I
  didn't know a life without them.

   [Contemplate] has the word temple in its roots, and originally
   referred to the kind of thinking you do in a special space set
   aside for observation. Now we use it to describe any kind of
   thinking that we spend a long time doing. While clicking on
   someone’s photos on Facebook doesn’t count as [contemplation],
   usually, you might spend hours in [contemplation] of your family
   and your history if you come across a box of old photos in the
   attic.

   Use the noun [rumination] when there's thoughtful consideration going
   on. If your grandfather answers every question by saying, "Hmm. Let me
   think about that," he is a fan of [rumination]. It comes from the verb
   ruminate, which means "to think deeply," but also means "to chew the
   cud." Both words come from the Latin word ruminatus, which has the
   same meaning and which is rooted in rumen, or "gullet."

   This adjective goes back to the 14th century English verb cunnen,
   which meant "to know," and is actually related to our English verb
   know. In earlier times, the noun was used to mean a high level of
   skill in using the hands. You can be [cunning], but you can also
   use your [cunning] to figure out a very clever and tricky plan.

   adjective
   1. notably large in size, amount, or extent.
      "a position of considerable influence"


   Use the adjective considerable to describe something that is large in
   amount. Things you probably spend a considerable amount of time on:
   homework and laundry. Things you'd rather spend time on: anything that
   isn't homework and laundry!

   The adjective considerable can describe something of importance and is
   worthy of notice or respect. If you are an excellent singer, dancer,
   musician, writer, or similar profession, people may ask you to donate
   your considerable talents to charitable causes. If you're not an
   excellent singer, dancer, musician, or writer, they will still ask you
   to donate, but they are more likely to ask for money!

   It was only with the greatest difficulty, and by exercising
   considerable cunning, that I managed to retain a few pages here and
   there which I could devote exclusively to animals.

   Clearly, you're interested in the [nicety] of a word's meaning if
   you're checking out this website. A [nicety] is a fine detail or shade
   of meaning that anything — not just a word — can possess.

   Even the word [nicety] has niceties. The emphasis on detail can also
   refer to a precision or accuracy of sorts; if someone has judged
   something "to a [nicety]," they've judged it exactly. Yet another
   common meaning is in the sense of a minor aspect of polite behavior.
   Washing your hands before dinner is a "social [nicety]." So is
   covering your mouth when you cough. Now where would we be without
   niceties?

   Depending on how you use it, the word [liability] has very different
   meanings. In a business or financial sense, a [liability] is a debt or
   fiscal obligation, like a mortgage or a loan. A limited [liability]
   company means if the company fails, the partners are on the hook for
   only what they initially invested in the company. A personal
   [liability], however, is some element of your past, your character, or
   your behavior that might give you a disadvantage.

   sense of urgency and emotion. While you wouldn't call asking for a
   hall pass a [plea], you could make a plea for justice or world
   peace.

   Plea also has a legal meaning. When you get a traffic ticket or if
   you're accused of a crime, you have to enter a plea of "guilty" or
   "not guilty." A "plea bargain" is when you make a deal with the
   prosecutor — you may plead guilty to a charge (by entering a guilty
   plea) that has less of a penalty and, in return, the prosecutor
   drops the more serious charge.

   In this Richard Dawkins book, he poses a question at the beginning
   of each chapter, offers colorful myths from different places around
   the world and finally reveals an elegant scientific answer. “It’s an
   engaging, well-illustrated science textbook offering compelling
   answers to big questions, from how the universe formed to what
   causes earthquakes,” Mr. Gates writes in his review. “It’s also a
   plea for readers of all ages to approach mysteries with rigor and
   curiosity, rather than buying into the supernatural myths at the
   core of most faith traditions.”

   mainly a strong sense of right and wrong, and a high standard of
   honesty. When a criminal or dictator does horrible things, people
   assume they have no sense of [decency]. When a tasteless or violent TV
   show becomes popular, some people wonder if society has lost its sense
   of [decency]. Asking "Have you no [decency]?" is a serious question,
   unless you're being silly and complaining about something like
   homework.

   The word [hapless] traces all the way back to the Old Norse word
   happ, meaning “chance, good luck.” Combine this with the suffix
   -less (“lacking”) and [hapless] means “unlucky” or “ill-fated.” A
   traveler who goes to Moscow and briefly gets lost on the subway?
   Just a tourist. A traveler who goes to Moscow, accidentally eats
   food he is allergic to, somehow loses all his money, and by chance
   gets on a train destined for Mongolia? Definitely [hapless].

   The verb [inflict] comes from the Latin word [inflict]us, meaning “to
   strike or dash against.” If you cause anything bad to happen to a
   person, animal, or even an object, you [inflict] that badness on
   them. For example, someone can [inflict] injuries or suffering on other
   people or [inflict] damage on property. We can [inflict] pollution or
   over-development on our environment. It's always a negative thing —
   you wouldn't say you [inflict] happiness or love on others.

   verb

      "she quailed at his heartless words"

   Smaller than the chicken and not as well known as the pigeon, quail
   is like the often-overlooked middle child of the ground-dwelling
   bird family. Quail can also mean to cringe in fear or pain. So if
   you are a quail, you might quail at the thought of quail-hunting
   season.

   Quail is a broad, catchall word; it can refer to any one of many
   small domestic game birds. So if you’re bragging about the quail you
   shot on a hunting trip to your uptight, bird-obsessed pals, they
   might demand to know if it was the Bobwhite quail, the Valley quail
   or the Scaled quail, to name just a few. If you use this word as a
   verb, it means to draw back in fear or pain. You might quail in fear
   at the sight of a playground bully. A good way to remember this verb
   meaning is to think of how the word chicken is also associated with
   fear.

   I should like to pay a special tribute to my mother, to whom this
   book is dedicated. Like a gentle, enthusiastic, and understanding
   Noah, she has steered her vessel full of strange progeny through the
   stormy seas of life with great skill, always faced with the
   possibility of mutiny, always surrounded by the dangerous shoals of
   overdraft and extravagance, never being sure that her navigation
   would be approved by the crew, but certain that she would be blamed
   for anything that went wrong. That she survived the voyage is a
   miracle, but survive it she did, and, moreover, with her reason more
   or less intact. As my brother Larry rightly points out, we can be
   proud of the way we have brought her up; she is a credit to us. That
   she has reached that happy Nirvana where nothing shocks or startles
   is exemplified by the fact that one week-end recently, when all
   alone in the house, she was treated to the sudden arrival of a
   series of crates containing two pelicans, a scarlet ibis, a vulture,
   and eight monkeys. A lesser mortal might have quailed at such a
   contingency, but not Mother. On Monday morning I found her in the
   garage being pursued round and round by an irate pelican which she

   If you go away to college, you’ll probably live in a [dorm]itory — or
   [dorm]. It's much more common for students to say [dorm] because it's
   shorter and slangier. A [dorm] is where students live, often with
   roommates. [Dorm]s have laundry rooms and rec rooms, and it's a place
   where many friendships are made. Students often study or try to

   are also called residence halls and student residences.

   [Divulge] often precedes the word secret, because it means to reveal

   The word [stroll] originally came to English through the German word
   [stroll]en, which means to wander aimlessly. The word [stroll] can also
   be used as a verb meaning to take a leisurely walk in which you do
   some wandering. You may enjoy a [stroll] through the park, along the
   beach, or down the city streets — take your time.

   noun
   1. a contagious bacterial disease characterized by fever and delirium, typically with the formation of buboes (see bubonic [plague] ) and sometimes infection of the lungs ( pneumonic [plague] ).
      "an outbreak of [plague]"

   verb
   1. cause continual trouble or distress to.
      "the problems that [plague]d the company"

   When the homeowner described her ant problem as a [plague], the
   exterminator thought she was being a bit melodramatic. After all, a
   few bugs aren't exactly a huge calamity.

   Centuries ago, if you had admitted to a friend that you had the
   [plague], that friend would have hightailed it in the other direction.
   In the Middle Ages, the [plague] was a horribly contagious illness
   that spread like wildfire through Europe, killing millions of
   people. Thanks to the introduction of better hygiene and
   antibiotics, [plague] doesn't describe a killer disease as often these
   days. Instead, it commonly overstates an annoyance, like an
   apartment dweller claiming his building is [plague]d by cockroaches.

   My problem is that I have been persecuted by an integer. For seven
   years this number has followed me around, has intruded in my most
   private data, and has assaulted me from the pages of our most public
   journals. This number assumes a variety of disguises, being
   sometimes a little larger and sometimes a little smaller than usual,
   but never changing so much as to be unrecognizable. The persistence
   with which this number [plague]s me is far more than a random
   accident. There is, to quote a famous senator, a design behind it,
   some pattern governing its appearances. Either there really is
   something unusual about the number or else I am suffering from
   delusions of persecution.

   noun
   1. an idiosyncratic belief or impression that is firmly maintained despite being contradicted by what is generally accepted as reality or rational argument, typically a symptom of mental disorder.
      "the delusion of being watched"

   A delusion is a belief that has no evidence in fact — a complete
   illusion. The cook at the hot dog stand who thinks he is the best
   chef in the world? That opinion is definitely a delusion.

   The noun delusion is often used in the phrase [delusions] of grandeur,
   which expresses the belief that unattainable goals are well within
   reach, like a terrible actress's [delusions] of grandeur that she
   won't just land her first role in a movie, it also will make her an
   Academy Award winner. [Delusions] like that can be amusing for
   onlookers, but other kinds of [delusions] are not, like those suffered
   by the mentally ill. Their [delusions] can remove them from reality,
   making it hard to function.

   A [cynical] person has a bleak outlook about others, always imagining

   verb
   1. twist together into a confused mass.
      "the broom somehow got [tangled] up in my long skirt"

   [Tangled] is an adjective that describes a confused mass. You're
   likely to hear [tangled] used most often when referring to hair. If
   it's [tangled], you can't brush or comb through it.

   Other than discussing hair, [tangled] can be used to refer to anything
   that's jumbled up and confused. Like that [tangled] pile of wires
   behind your television and computer that you keep tripping over.
   [Tangled] can also mean something highly complicated or intricate,
   like the relationships between ex-wives, ex-husbands and
   stepchildren in a family. The word [tangled] is most famous for being
   included in a well-known literary quote from Sir Walter Scott's
   poem, "Marmion" — "Oh what a [tangled] web we weave, when first we
   practise to deceive."

   Answer: There are three units that exist in the preceding code and
   that are as follows: __init__, method1, and method2. __init__ is a
   method, just as method1 and method2. The fact that it's a
   constructor means that it's all [tangled] up with the other units, but
   it's still a method containing code and a possible location for
   bugs, and so we cannot afford to treat this as anything other than a
   unit.

   noun
   1. a lengthy and complicated procedure.
      "he went through the [rigmarole] of securing the front door"


   Rigamarole is a messy, complicated process that takes longer than it
   should. The rigamarole involved in getting your driver's license
   might make it tempting to just keep riding your bike.

   The word rigamarole, which is also spelled [rigmarole], is a great way
   to describe bureaucratic procedures like paying taxes or registering
   for college classes, or lengthy tasks like helping a small child put
   on boots, mittens, a coat, and a hat before leaving the house on a
   snowy day. You can also use it to mean "a long, rambling story:" "He
   went into the rigamarole of how he'd pulled himself up by his boot
   straps."

   The smaller the units are, the more useful the tests tend to be
   because they narrow down the location and nature of bugs more
   quickly. For example, if you choose to treat the Testable class as a
   unit, tests of the class will fail if there is a mistake in any of
   the methods. This tells you that there's a mistake in Testable, but
   not that it's in method2, or wherever it actually is. On the other
   hand, there is a certain amount of rigamarole involved in treating
   method4 and its like as units, to such an extent that the next
   chapter of the book is dedicated to dealing with such situations.
   Even so, I recommend using methods and functions as units most of
   the time because it pays off in the long run.

Something daunting can scare you off. If you have a lot of studying to
do, it may seem like a daunting task. Good news is you can get through
it by working hard. Or weasel out of it by playing sick.

Often used in the phrases “daunting prospect” and “daunting task,”
daunting describes something that you are not looking forward to
doing. Having to fill out complicated tax forms every year is a
daunting task for many people. Once a daunting task is complete, you
no longer describe it as daunting, but instead can call it a job well
done, or at least another life experience survived.

Keeping track of multiple repositories may seem like a /daunting/
     prospect, but the fundamentals you learn in this chapter apply
     just the same.

   satisfied with where you are right now.

   A [swath] was originally the long narrow space created by a single
   swing of a scythe in a field of grass or corn as the cutter moved
   through it. Nowadays it is used more figuratively to mean any kind
   of path someone makes.

   The figurative use of [swath] has nonphysical senses as well, as in
   the term "a significant [swath] of the population believes..." Or if
   someone is trying to attract attention to themselves, or is making
   quite a public stir, they might be said to be "cutting a [swath]
   through the business world" or "cutting a [swath] on the dance floor."
   Hopefully, neither of the latter involves using scythes.

   A [scythe] is a sharp, curved blade used for mowing or reaping. While

   In Old English, [scythe] was spelled siðe. Since there is no longer an
   ð in modern English, [scythe] became the accepted form of the word in
   the early 15th century. It drew its sc- start from the Latin
   scissor, meaning “carver, cutter.” Farmers use these tools to slice
   and trim grass and other plant stalks. Napoleon Bonaparte once noted
   that “Occupation is the [scythe] of time,” meaning that work mows down
   or diminishes time.

 verb
  1. cause (a large amount of damage or harm).
     "torrential rainstorms [wreak]ed havoc yesterday"

 To [wreak] is to cause something to happen, usually with a terrible
 consequence. You can make mischief, cause problems, or inflict pain,
 but to [wreak] damage suggests a deeper level of destruction.

 [Wreak] stems from the Old English wrecan, meaning "to avenge." Its
 current meaning, that of causing something to happen — usually with
 dire consequences — came about in the 19th century. The word is a
 transitive verb, often paired with the equally intense havoc, meaning
 "devastation."

 And that sort of negative feedback can [wreak] havoc on your psyche.

 verb
  1. lay waste to; devastate.

 [Havoc] is a noun that means devastation or total mayhem. [Havoc] often
 wreaked by hurricanes, angry mobs, plundering Vikings, and wild
 parties that get out of control.

 If we trace [havoc] way back, we arrive at a crossroads. Some people
 believe that the word comes from the Old French havot, meaning
 “plundering, devastation,” while others argue that it was passed down
 to us from the Latin habere, meaning “to have, possess.” Either way
 you look at it, the meaning remains the same: widespread disorder or
 destruction.

   describes the loss you feel when someone you love dies. You are
   suddenly deprived of the person's presence, and missing and mourning
   leads to being [bereaved]. Losing a pet causes similar feelings, and
   you can be [bereaved] when a person goes away but is still alive. Loss
   and separation even in life are still reason to be [bereaved] over the
   absence. If someone leaves and you miss them deeply, you may be
   [bereaved].

   breed dog." Dogs called crossbreeds are deliberately bred to combine
   characteristics of two or more recognized breeds, while [mutt]s — also

    "two mischievous kittens had decorated the bed with shredded newspaper"

If you’re the one making prank phone calls at 3 am and you can’t
resist short-sheeting your camp counselor’s bunk, you're mischievous.
If your dog likes to decorate your house with streamers of toilet
paper, he's mischievous, too.

You can be mischievous in harmless, playful ways, or you might also
use the word mischievous to describe behavior that's more than just a
little naughty. If you post online some embarrassing photos of an
acquaintance, your more generous friends might describe your behavior
as mischievous, although others might accuse you of being downright
mean. Keep in mind that the word has only three syllables:
MIS-chuh-vuhs.

He
handed it back to me with a mischievous smirk.

 1. вмешиваться (interfere, intervene, meddle, tamper, step in, interrupt)
 2. помешать (intervene, intercept, hopple)
 3. вступаться (intercede, intervene)
 4. вступать в дело (intervene, embark)

 9. иметь место (take place, occur, come off, pass, intervene)
10. находиться (be, locate, reside, lie, exist, be found)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. come between so as to prevent or alter a result or course of events.
    "he acted outside his authority when he intervened in the dispute"
 2. occur in time between events.
    "to occupy the intervening months, she took a job in a hospital"

Intervening means happening between other things. Middle school is an
intervening phase between elementary school and high school.

Intervening is an adjective that comes from the Latin intervenire,
from inter-, meaning “between,” and venire, meaning “come.” That which
is intervening comes between. The intervening period of your life
between high school and college could involve a stint in the circus.
You never know.

Though the intervening two thousand years have seen quite a few
innovations in the art of memory, the basic techniques have remained
fundamentally unchanged from those described in the Ad Herennium.

   1. the works of a painter, composer, or author regarded
      collectively. "the complete [oeuvre] of Mozart"


   The [oeuvre] of a writer or artist refers to all their work combined.
   Writing one book isn't much of an [oeuvre], but writing ten could be.

   This is a French word often used by critics — people who comment on
   the work of writers, painters, musicians, and other artists. An
   [oeuvre] is the total output of an artist. Just like critics give a
   thumbs up or down to a single movie, they give opinions on [oeuvre]s
   as well. You could say a band's current album stinks, but since
   they've made great music for 10 years, they still have an impressive
   [oeuvre].

   Before I sampled Tony Buzan’s expansive [oeuvre] (he’s authored or
   coauthored over 120 books) or any of the self-help books put out by
   the top mental athletes, Ed wanted me to start my investigation with
   the classics.

   1. (of a person) able to read and write. "Most of us are familiar
      with the concept of literacy as it applies to reading and writing
      and it is generally accepted that being [literate] means being able
      to decipher the written word and compose written work."

   noun
   1. a [literate] person. "If these were wanton act of miscreants, one
      incident that took place inside the Government Medical College
      campus on Thursday has proved that even the [literate]s are not
      bothered to ‘rescue’ a roadside tree from being consumed by
      flames."

   If you're [literate] you can read and write, and since you're reading
   this, that's what you are.

   [Literate] can also mean more than just being able to read and write,
   but being really fluent in a field. If you're "computer [literate],"
   you know how to use a computer with ease. If you're up on the latest
   advances in science, you're "scientifically [literate]." If people
   describe you admiringly as [literate], they think you're widely read
   and know a lot about lots of different fields. The opposite of
   [literate] is il[literate].

   Today many more of the young men and women who complete high school
   enter and complete four years of college; a much larger proportion
   of the population has become [literate] in spite of or even because of
   the popularity of radio and television.

/dɪˌsɪd əˈreɪ təm/

noun
 1. что-либо недостающее (desideratum)
 2. что-либо желаемое (desideratum)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. something that is needed or wanted.
    "integrity was a desideratum"

A desideratum is something you desire or want. It's a fancy word for a
must-have.

This official-sounding Latin word means something very common:
anything you want or need. A new book could be a desideratum. A
chocolate cake could be a desideratum. More commonly, a desideratum is
something that is truly needed, like food or shelter. For many people,
a happy marriage is a desideratum. For a politician, getting elected
is a desideratum. You can almost see the word desire in desideratum,
and that should help you remember it’s an object of desire.

One
constant is that, to achieve all the purposes of reading, the desideratum
must be the ability to read different things at
different-appropriate-speeds, not everything at the greatest possible
speed.

    неумелость

    noun
    1. неумелость (ineptitude, inefficiency, inexpertness)
    2. неуместность (irrelevance, impropriety, incongruity, ineptitude,
       impertinence, inaptitude)
    3. глупость (stupidity, folly, foolishness, silliness, absurdity,
       ineptitude)
    4. неумение (ineptitude, inaptitude)
    5. неспособность (inability, failure, disability, incapacity,
       incapability, ineptitude)
    6. несоответствие (discrepancy, disparity, nonconformity,
       nonconformance, imbalance, ineptitude)
    7. глупое замечание (ineptitude)
    8. абсурдность (absurdity, nonsense, irrationality,
       preposterousness, ineptitude, grotesqueness)

    Ineptitude is a lack of skill, ability, or competence. A doctor
    would prove his ineptitude at practicing medicine if he mistakenly
    removed a patient's spleen instead of his kidney.

    Ineptitude and incompetence are synonyms to describe people who have
    absolutely no idea what they're doing. It's definitely not a quality
    you'd want in a pilot, who might prove his ineptitude by sending a
    plane full of passengers hurtling to the ground. Ineptitude also
    isn't a good quality to have in fields like medicine, where even one
    careless mistake could be life-threatening.

    A great many pupils do poorly in high school because of sheer
    ineptitude in getting meaning from the printed page.

 To [deem] is a verb that means to view as or judge. Your parents or boss
 may [deem] something necessary that you don't, like coming home by
 midnight or working late.

 [Deem] comes from the Old English word, deman — meaning "act as a
 judge." If you [deem] something, you essentially become the judge of
 whether it has a characteristic. For example, if you [deem] your little
 sister's jokes to be too ridiculous to listen to, you will probably
 just walk away.

 introverts will [deem] it fit to conform to the extrovert model, as a

   originally meant "lacking value or effect, futile"; we still say "a

   "without success." Normally, though, [vain] means "conceited, too
   proud of oneself." Carly Simon's line "You're so [vain], you probably
   think this song is about you" is an excellent illustration of this

 It's hard to use it gracefully.

 A "cumber" is something that slows you down, and though the words
 aren't related, "lumber" includes big pieces of heavy wood, which
 might slow down the person carrying them. Moving lumber is [cumbersome],
 because it's a heavy and awkward job. Getting your laundry down the
 stairs or putting a Rottweiler in the bathtub can be [cumbersome] too.

 - If it is [cumbersome] to use the external interface to set up the exact state
   that we want, or there is no interface method that retrieves the specific value
   we want to assert, then we may need to peek into the implementation in our
   tests.

      "the moon [exert]s a force on the Earth"
   2. make a physical or mental effort.
      "he needs to [exert] himself to try to find an answer"

   [Exert] basically means to put forth effort to do something. For
   example, when you [exert] yourself in a workout, you can really feel
   the burn in your muscles.

   The Latin verb exserere — with its derivative form exsertus, which
   is the source of our word — means to "put forth." That's where [exert]
   gets its meaning of physical force — consider that when you try hard
   at something, you put forth effort to do it, you push yourself. But
   [exert] can refer to other ways you "push": you [exert] your influence
   to convince others to think your way; when one nation [exert]s its
   power on another; and gravity [exert]s its force on us, holding us
   down on earth.

   One reader is better than another in proportion as he is capable of

 verb
  1. completely remove or get rid of (something).
     "a policy that would eliminate inflation"

 As eliminate means "get rid of or do away with," it has become used to
 refer to the end of a problem or even an entire species. We need to
 eliminate sources of pollution in order to maintain a healthy world.

 The original literal meaning of eliminate was "to thrust over the
 threshold and out of doors, to kick out," but the 18th century saw the
 word expand to mean "to exclude," and later to ridding the body of
 waste. The verb then came to refer to getting rid of anything, such as
 a problem or foul odor. The word took an ominous turn in the 20th
 century, when we saw man-made pollution eliminate whole species, and
 war, hate, and famine nearly eliminate whole groups of people.

 The aim of refactoring is to make the
 code better by [eliminating] some code smell.

/ˈɑr mə stɪs/

When two sides of a war need a break from killing each other, they
agree to an armistice, a temporary battle timeout. An armistice isn’t
permanent, but it’s usually a sign that both sides want to give peace
a chance.

War is exhausting, and sometimes you need an armistice to catch your
breath and figure out a more peaceful way to live. The word has two
Greek roots: arma which means “weapons,” and stitium which means
“stoppage.” When you’re ready to stop using your weapons, it’s time to
propose an armistice. Although the word looks like a mouthful, it’s
easy to pronounce if you remember that it’s an arm with two rhymes:
ARM-iss-tiss.

The third map shows the 1949 armistice lines which Jordan and the arab
nations specifically said were NOT final borders just because they
wanted to conquer all of Israel eventually.

     "a mission which could not possibly [succeed]"
  2. take over a throne, inheritance, office, or other position from.
     "he would [succeed] Hawke as prime minister"

 When you [succeed] at something, you reach a goal or do really well. If
 you practice speaking Arabic every day, you are likely to [succeed] at
 becoming fluent in this language.

 When you [succeed], you achieve the result you hope for, but another way
 to use [succeed] is to describe taking over a position. A prince who
 will inherit his father's kingdom will [succeed] his father one day, and
 a new high school principal can be said to [succeed] the old one. The
 Latin root of [succeed] is succedere, come close after.

 You will not [succeed] in life if you expect people to hold your hand
 and give you all the answers.

 adjective
  1. having or showing dogged determination not to change one's attitude or position on something, especially in spite of good arguments or reasons to do so.
     "he accused her of being a silly, [stubborn] old woman"

 Use the adjective [stubborn] to describe someone who is not open to new
 ideas or ways of doing things, like your uncle who refuses to listen
 to any music made after 1990. [Stubborn] is the opposite of flexible.

 The Middle English version of [stubborn] carried the sense of
 “untamable, implacable,” and there’s still a hint of that in how it is
 used today. A [stubborn] person holds on to a view or an attitude,
 refusing to change — to the point of being unreasonable. Things can
 also be [stubborn], like a stain that no amount of scrubbing can clean
 or a medical condition that, even with treatment, doesn't improve.

 Some people might be naturally more [stubborn] and persevering, which
 will probably come in handy.

[2016-08-30 Tue 13:41]

To disrupt is to interrupt or throw something into disorder. If you
don't turn your phone off before a play, it might ring and disrupt the
actors and the audience.

Disrupt goes back to the Latin root disrumpere, "to break apart." When
you disrupt, you break someone's concentration, break up a routine, or
break apart a system or order, as when bad weather disrupts the travel
plans of people in airports. Even if your headphones keep the music in
your ears only, singing out loud can disrupt those around you. A
larger interruption would be if a war were to erupt. That would
disrupt the peace of an entire region and its people.

Everyone has an inner giant inside that is begging to be unleashed and
disrupt this world.

 that you are asked to leave and never come back. In other words, you
 have been kicked out.

 More benignly, expel can mean discharge: if you're having a
 water-fountain spitting-fight, you are hoping to expel water from your
 mouth in the direction of your opponent before they can get you. But
 don't do this; you won't get [expelled] from school, but the germs in

   1. a short metal pin or bolt for holding together two plates of
      metal, its headless end being beaten out or pressed down when in
      place. "‘For one, I just went to the hardware store and bought
      sheet metal, [rivet]s and screws, and bolts and nuts’ he said."

   verb
   1. join or fasten (plates of metal or other material) with a [rivet]
      or [rivet]s. "the linings are bonded, not [rivet]ed, to the brake
      shoes for longer wear"

   A [rivet] is a metal fastener, a bolt-like device that holds together
   two pieces of metal or fabric. The round metal fasteners on your
   favorite pair of jeans are [rivet]s.

   Older buildings with metal frames like the Eiffel Tower are held
   together with [rivet]s, and so are some bridges and military vehicles.
   Furniture upholstery often involves [rivet]s, too. When you use a
   [rivet] to fasten, you can say you [rivet] — and similarly, to hold
   attention or captivate is also to [rivet]. The Old French root is
   river, "to clench or fasten."

Resuscitation is the action of bringing someone back to consciousness.
Ambulance workers are skilled at resuscitation.

To resuscitate is to revive someone who has passed out: this act is
called resuscitation. If someone needs resuscitation, something
serious has happened — the person has lost consciousness and may be on
the verge of death. You've probably heard of "mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation," which is one method of reviving. Medical professionals
have many other techniques and gadgets that aid resuscitation. The
Latin root word is resuscitare, "rouse again, or revive," from re and
suscitare, "to raise."

 The word [hinder] came from the Old English hindrian, which means to

 Take the noun [tenure] for the period of time a person holds a position
 or office. Your [tenure] as a student ends when you graduate high school
 — unless, of course, you go on to college.

 [Tenure] from the Latin tenere means "to hold" and refers to the period
 of time a person works at a particular job or in an office. A
 president might have to deal with a recession during his [tenure] in the
 White House. In university jargon, if you have [tenure], you have a
 permanent teaching position or professorship. In this sense, [tenure]
 can also be used as a verb. You've got it made if you're [tenure]d at

   but journalists who get a story before others also get a [scoop], and
   dog owners need to [scoop] up after their dogs or else they will get a

   When a newspaper reporter gets a [scoop], it means they beat every
   other reporter to publish an important story. Other meanings of
   [scoop] come from the shape and motion of a [scoop], which is hollowed
   out and looks kind of like a pocket. Also, if you pick up a little
   dog into your arms, you might say you [scoop]ed it up. [Scoop] is one of

   when you go to an ice cream shop you can ask your server to give you
   one, two, or three [scoop]s.

   [Apathetic] is an adjective that describes the feeling of being bored
   with what’s going on around you. If you don’t care one way or
   another, you’re [apathetic].

   The Greek word pathos describes a type of emotional suffering that
   afflicts people who are super sensitive to their environment. Pathos
   is a root word of [apathetic], but the prefix a- turns it into the
   opposite: emotional boredom, insensitivity, and a lack of
   enthusiasm. Maybe you feel [apathetic] because nothing around you
   stirs your interest, or maybe it’s because you need some coffee.

   noun
   1. a large farming implement with one or more blades fixed in a
      frame, drawn by a tractor or by animals and used for cutting
      furrows in the soil and turning it over, especially to prepare
      for the planting of seeds. "The strip shape of these plots
      suggests that they were ploughed with a heavy plough with a fixed
      mould board."
   2. a yoga pose assumed by lying on one's back and swinging one's

   The large blades of a [plow] break up the earth, cutting and turning
   it so it's loose and ready to be planted with seeds. When you

* imbue :Quora:

To imbue is to fill up with or become "soaked" in an idea or emotion,
as a sponge takes in water. One visit to Africa might be enough to
imbue ambitions in a medical student to return to heal the sick.

You can use imbue in a similar way as "saturate," or "soak through,"
to describe a filling or absorbing. A "hue" is a color, and it rhymes
with imbue. When you're imbued with something, you are, in a way,
colored by it. If you imbue a dish sponge with oily orange water from
a spaghetti bowl, the color and the oil soak in. To fill people with
qualities or emotions is, for example, to imbue them with strength or
optimism.

Bu the point is this: the most productive people take their daily
habits and routines and they try to imbue them with aspects that
encourage them to think more deeply.

Mere means pure and simple, nothing more and nothing less. If the mere

Mere can have a little irony attached. If you introduce yourself as "a
mere student," when you’re announcing your astounding invention,
you're contrasting your lowly status with the enormity of your
invention. This kind of mere comes from the Latin for "undiluted."
Mere has a homograph — a completely different word that's spelled the
same — and this mere means a lake or a pond. It’s related to the Dutch
word meer — there’s lots of water in Holland.

the origin of life; Could life possibly form from mere chemicals?

If you go snowboarding in a leotard, prepare for an ensuing cold.
Ensuing means "coming right after, or as a result of something that
happened."

Ensuing is the adjective form of the verb ensue, which comes from the
Old French ensuivre, which means "following in." We usually use it to
show cause and effect. Blame your for entrepreneurial friend taking
bets in the lunchroom for the ensuing crackdown on employee gambling.
An ensuing event happens right after its cause. If a dog bites you
when you're eight, and twenty years later you start having nightmares
about dog bites, those aren't ensuing nightmares. They're surfacing
memories.

Nevertheless,
the mere possibility prompted later ideas that the origin of life on
earth indeed lay elsewhere in the universe, ideas that were greeted
with varying degrees of scepticism over ensuing decades.

If you just can't get enough popcorn, even the jumbo tub at the movie
theater may not be enough to satiate, or satisfy, your desire.

Satiate is often used in situations in which a thirst, craving, or
need is satisfied. However, when satiate is used to describe eating,
it can take on a more negative, or even disgusted, tone. If you
comment that the diners at the world's largest all-you-can eat buffet
were satiated, you might not mean that they were merely satisfied. You
could be implying that they've been gluttons, and that they are now
overstuffed with fried chicken wings and mac and cheese.

Anyone might have a cupcake. If you have 10 cupcakes, that's a

* hokey :Quora:
[2016-11-14 Mon 14:51]

Something that's hokey is silly and sentimental — you could also call
it "sappy" or "mawkish." A hokey speech is more likely to make people
roll their eyes and squirm than to make them cry.

You can buy your friend a hokey birthday card as a joke, or read her a
hokey poem to make her laugh. There's a hint of insincerity when
something's hokey — people can tell that the sentiments in your hokey
yearbook quote aren't entirely genuine. In the mid-1800s, hokey-pokey
was defined as "false, cheap material," possibly based on hocus-pocus,
and usually referring to artificial flavoring in cheap ice cream.
Today, the hokey-pokey is mainly known as a silly dance.

This is going to sound hokey, but the truth is: I gave birth.

 not looking, they probably weren't being [sincere].

 If you've been offered a [sincere] thanks for something you've done, the

* alleviate :Quora:
[2016-11-20 Sun 17:24]

облегчать

verb
 1. облегчать (facilitate, alleviate, ease, relieve, lighten, enable)
 2. смягчать (soften, mitigate, remit, alleviate, moderate, cushion)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. make (suffering, deficiency, or a problem) less severe.
    "he couldn't prevent her pain, only alleviate it"

Do all these words make your head ache? If so, take an aspirin to
alleviate, or relieve, your pain.

The verb, alleviate, stems from the Latin root, levis "light" and is
related to modern English words such as elevator and levitate — both
words implying a lightening of one's load. Alleviate also has this
sense of lightening a burden such as physical pain or emotional
duress. You can take medicine to alleviate symptoms or do exercise to
alleviate stress. Or if you want a bigger challenge: try alleviating
traffic congestion or world hunger.

Terrain that is broken and uneven is called rugged. If you want an
easy hike, you should stay away from the rugged coastline. That rocky
shoreline is definitely for the more experienced hikers.

The same sense of unevenness applies to other things that are
described as rugged. If someone tells a man that he has a rugged face,
it's meant to compliment his rough, strong looks. Rugged can also
describe something that is steady, sturdy, and strong. Only your
rugged constitution will keep you alive in that period of famine

Praise means "admiration or approval," and when you're on the
receiving end of it, you feel great.

Whether it's used as a verb or a noun, praise means "approval." If you
enthusiastically praise your dog, he's likely to wag his tail and
expect a treat. What you've given him (in addition to the treat) is
praise, the noun. In a religious context, the verb praise is
interchangeable with worship, as when a minister says, "Praise God."

* presume :Quora:
[2016-11-20 Sun 17:43]

If you presume something, it means you act as though it's true before
all the evidence is in. If you are presumed to be the fastest runner,
don't get too cocky — that word implies that you haven't actually
raced yet.

To presume is to take something for granted. The famous quote “Dr.
Livingstone, I presume?” comes from the explorer Henry Morton Stanley,
who ran into the explorer David Livingstone in the wilds of Africa in
1871. It’s funny because these were the only two white men known to be
in that part of Africa at the time.

Third thing: if you're a civilian with no prior regional experience
(as most people are), please don't presume to know more about
warfighting in Iraq than I do.
* privy :Quora:
[2016-11-20 Sun 17:44]

If you're privy to something, you've been let in on a secret or know
about something that most people don't. Not many people are privy to
what those top secret documents are all about, for example.

The adjective privy comes from the Latin privatus, meaning “private,”
and describes someone who has knowledge of secret or confidential
information. But watch out: If you use privy as a noun, it can mean
“outhouse” or “toilet,” which actually might be a good place to hide
your diary if you don't want anyone else to be privy to its contents.

You are entitled to have a different
opinion, but when it comes to facts, I'm privy to more of them than
you are.

пересечение

noun
 1. пересечение (intersection, crossing, traversal, confluence, decussation, conflux)

* sequel :Quora:
[2016-11-21 Mon 16:41]

A sequel is a continuation or part two. The Empire Strikes Back and
Toy Story 2 are sequels. Many successful movies have sequels.

The most common meaning of sequel is for a book or movie that follows
another, but the term can be used for just about anything that comes
second. We might say of an actress who begins her career with a bang,
"What will she do for a sequel?" A football team that wins a
championship may have trouble with the sequel — trying to win another
one next year. All sequels have a tough challenge — living up to the
original.

In the sequel, because there is a one-to-one correspondence between nodes
and the subtrees rooted by them, we sometimes leave it to the context
whether the name of an object stands for the node or the subtree.
* rid :Quora:
[2016-11-23 Wed 11:58]

избавиться

verb
 1. освобождать (rid, free, exempt, release, loose, liberate)
 2. избавлять (deliver, rid, save, rescue, redeem, release)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. make someone or something free of (a troublesome or unwanted person or thing).
    "we now have the greatest chance ever to rid the world of nuclear weapons"

When you clear out or eliminate something you don't want, you rid
yourself of it. If even one child is allergic to peanuts, a school
will often rid the cafeteria of all food made with peanuts.

For years, activists have worked to rid the world of nuclear weapons,
while a dieter's priority might be to rid himself of ten extra pounds.
Freeing someone from something unwanted is to rid them of it, whether
it's ants in their kitchen or stress about their job. In the
thirteenth century, rid meant "clear a space, set free, or save," from
a Scandinavian root that's related to the Old Norse ryðja, "to clear
land of obstructions."

If your little brother quietly obeys your instructions and waits for
you at the food court while you and your friends wander around the
mall, he's probably a tractable child, meaning he's obedient,
flexible, and responds well to directions.

Note the similarity between tractable and tractor. Both come from the
Latin word tractare, which originally meant "to drag about." You can
think of a tractable person as someone who can be dragged about
easily, like a plow being dragged by a tractor.

* commitment :Quora:
[2016-11-24 Thu 20:32]

Making a commitment involves dedicating yourself to something, like a
person or a cause. Before you make a commitment, think carefully. A
commitment obligates you to do something.

Some commitments are large, like marriage. When you take a job, you're
making a commitment to show up and do the job well, and your employer
makes a commitment to pay you. There are smaller commitments too. If
you said you'd meet a friend at six, that's a commitment — show up or
your friend will be mad. You also can speak of commitment as a
quality. Staying after school for a study group shows your commitment
to good grades.

Meanwhile writing requires creativity, persistence and commitment.
* perseverance :Quora:
[2016-11-24 Thu 20:45]

Perseverance is not giving up. It is persistence and tenacity, the
effort required to do something and keep doing it till the end, even
if it's hard.

Perseverance originally comes from the Latin perseverantia and means
to abide by something strictly. This makes sense, because if you're
doing something in spite of all the difficulty, you're being strict on
yourself. Sailing around the world and climbing Mt. Everest are acts
requiring perseverance. Even things like learning a new language
require perseverance and daily practice.

But ask them how they made it and they will wax poetic about
how it was all just a matter of hard work and perseverance— never mind
the foundation and framework of the public goods that enabled that to
a large degree.
* dismantle :Quora:
[2016-11-24 Thu 20:47]

To take something apart or down is to dismantle it. If you dismantle a
computer to see what it looks like inside, you better know how to put
it back together, or you might be looking at the inside of your room
for awhile.

Dismantle is a verb used for both physical things and ideas. You can
dismantle a campground by taking down the tents and breaking apart the
fire logs, or you can dismantle a government by going against its
leadership and bringing down its rule. Often when you dismantle
something, you take away its ability to work, as with a nuclear
warhead, but you can also take apart decorative or non-working things,
as when you dismantle a science-fair display or a city made of blocks.

Worse still is their attempt to dismantle and undercut that framework
now that they have theirs.

* immersed :Quora:
[2016-11-26 Sat 21:20]

погруженный

adjective
 1. погруженный (immersed, submerged, sunk, deep, buried, intent)
 2. поглощенный (absorbed, engrossed, engaged, immersed, rapt, deep)
 3. углубленный (immersed)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. dip or submerge in a liquid.
    "immerse the paper in water for twenty minutes"
 2. involve oneself deeply in a particular activity or interest.
    "she immersed herself in her work"

If you immerse yourself in your work, you completely involve yourself
in it, spending long hours in the office and thinking about work all
the time.

Immerse can also mean to submerge in a liquid. A science experiment
might tell you to immerse a piece of paper completely in water. If you
are a swimmer immersed in a rigorous training regimen, you might be
immersing yourself in the pool several times a day.

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a stretch of land, especially with regard to its physical features.
    "they were delayed by rough terrain"


An ATV, or all-terrain vehicle, is useful for people who drive on lots
of different terrain, hence the name. Terrain is a noun used to talk
about the ground, when you're specifically interested in how it
appears or is shaped.

In times of war, you'll often hear the term "hostile terrain" used to
describe a region with lots of mountains, vast stretches of desert, or
impenetrable jungles. These are all areas of difficult terrain that
are hard to pass. Much of humankind's history can be traced by its
effort to alter the terrain. We've made mountains into meadows, rivers
into lakes, and prairies into roads, all to make the terrain more
livable for us. You could even go so far as to say that a person's
psyche is mysterious terrain.

Terrain that is broken and uneven is called rugged.

* stint :Quora:

 3. урезать (cut, cut down, curtail, skimp, truncate, stint)

noun
 1. ограничение (limitation, restriction, restraint, bound, stint, confinement)
 2. урочная работа (task, stint, task-work)
 3. определенная норма (stint)
 4. предел (limit, range, scope, bound, margin, stint)
 5. граница (border, boundary, limit, bound, frontier, stint)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a person's fixed or allotted period of work.
    "his varied career included a stint as a magician"
 2. limitation of supply or effort.
    "a collector with an eye for quality and the means to indulge it without stint"
 3. a small short-legged sandpiper of northern Eurasia and Alaska, with a brownish back and white underparts.
    "More than half a dozen species of birds have come to roost, which include black-winged stilts, cattle and little egrets, little stints , common sandpipers, pond herons and little winged plovers."

verb
 1. supply an ungenerous or inadequate amount of (something).
    "stowage room hasn't been stinted"


The noun stint means a set amount of time in which you do something —
often work of some sort. "She served a stint in the army, followed by
a stint in an office setting, before settling on a career as a lounge
singer."

Unlike a project or vocation, a stint can refer to the stretch of time
spent doing a particular job. You apply for a job, but you refer to
your past stint in the Peace Corps. As a verb, stint means to be
sparing or frugal, or restrict in a stingy manner ("to skimp"). "The
school board chose to make cuts at the administrative level, rather
than stint on the children's education."

Betrayal means "an act of deliberate disloyalty," like when your

Betrayal's root is betray, which comes from the Middle English word
bitrayen — meaning "mislead, deceive." Betrayal has to do with
destroying someone's trust, possibly by lying. If you start dating
your best friend's girlfriend behind his back, that's an act of
betrayal. Betrayal can also mean "helping an enemy," such as a person
who gives secret information to a country that is at war with his or
her own.

In the US, attending school through the twelfth grade, driving on the

mandatory. The phrase "mandatory requirement" is redundant.

A mandatory action is something that is required, obligatory, or
compulsory. Like letting your Great Aunt Edna pinch your cheeks or
passing gym to get your diploma. Mandatory is often used in opposition
to optional. If you want to compete with the swim team at school,
weeknight practices are mandatory, meaning you have to go, though the
Saturday dawn swim practice remains optional, meaning it's up to you.

There are countless beautiful

* concussion :Quora:
[2016-12-25 Sun 17:39]

A concussion is a violent blow, especially to the head, that often
injures the brain or causes a loss of consciousness — an
all-too-frequent occurrence, unfortunately, in contact sports like
football or boxing.

First used around 1400, concussion originates from the Latin
concussionem, which means "a shaking." Your brain certainly gets "a
shaking" when you take a heavy blow to the head, which sometimes
causes injury or permanent damage. It's not just people, though, who
get concussions; a building can also suffer from a concussion during
an earthquake.

When I was 20 years old, one of my many failures in judgement resulted
in me getting a rather severe concussion.
* chops :Quora:

To chop is to cut something by hacking at it. In many places, there
are farms where you can chop down your own Christmas tree.

When you chop wood, you usually hit it with an axe, splitting each
length into narrow pieces. A chef uses a knife to chop, hacking an
onion into tiny bits, for example. When it's a piece of meat that's
cut so it's attached to a bone, such as part of a rib, it can be
described as a chop — like a lamb chop. And if someone claps his hands
at you and says, "Chop-chop!" he means "Hurry up!"

If he has deep understanding of a dozen languages then damn, that guy

 3. выстоять (withstand, stand out, outstay)
 4. сопротивляться (resist, oppose, fight back, withstand, stand against, antagonize)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. remain undamaged or unaffected by; resist.
    "the structure had been designed to withstand winds of more than 100 mph"

In the story of the three little pigs, only the house made of brick
was able to withstand the huffing and puffing of the Big Bad Wolf. To
withstand is to hold up against something strong.

Withstand means to stand your ground against a powerful and negative
force. A lot of toys can withstand rough treatment, but CDs definitely
can't. And hopefully, you can withstand the pressures of school and
work! If you can withstand a lot of criticism, it means you can take
it without giving up.

If
physically you're feeling good and have the requisite energy for productivity, emotionally you're stable and able
to withstand the stress of having a lot to do, and mentally you aren't bogged down by identifying with every
passing thought, then you have set yourself up for maximum productivity.

 3. выполнимый (executable, feasible, doable, workable, implementable, manageable)
 4. вероятный (likely, probable, possible, credible, plausible, feasible)
 5. исполнимый (executable, feasible)
 6. правдоподобный (plausible, probable, colorable, specious, verisimilar, feasible)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. possible to do easily or conveniently.
    "it is not feasible to put most finds from excavations on public display"

If something is feasible, then you can do it without too much
difficulty. When someone asks "Is it feasible?" the person is asking
if you'll be able to get something done.

Feasible things are possible. If you have enough time, money, or
energy to do something, it's feasible. Something might be feasible at
one time and then not feasible at another time. Because of
technological advances and competition with the Russians, going to the
moon was feasible for the United States in the sixties. Often, people
disagree about what's feasible, especially in politics, where how
feasible a project is counts for a lot.

Astound means to amaze. Savants, or those with extreme brain
abnormalities, can astound people by their ability to play Beethoven
sonatas on the piano after having heard them only once.

Astound has its roots in the verb astonish, originally meaning to
stun, and the idea of surprise remains wrapped up in the word. Things
like over-the-top fireworks, believable magicians, and the miracle of
life tend to astound. But if you lick all your favorite cookies to

Invariably describes things that don't change and never vary — they're

This adverb is useful when discussing things that happen all the time
or don't change. In football, teams that win the Super Bowl invariably
have a good defense. In schools, many students invariably struggle
with writing. Invariably, the weather is hard to predict. In a lot of
cases, invariably means always or almost always. You can count on
things that are invariable.

But the extra effort invariably pays dividends in increased

 1. беременность (pregnancy, gestation, childbearing)
 2. созревание (maturation, aging, gestation, mellowing, ageing)
 3. период беременности (gestation)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. the process of carrying or being carried in the womb between conception and birth.
    "The reproductive cycle in the adult female consists of all processes leading to conception, gestation , and birth of offspring."

Gestation is the period of time when something is conceived and
developed. The gestation period for human babies lasts nine months.

Gestation comes from the Latin gestare, which means to bear, or give
birth to. We can talk about the gestation of fetus before it's born,
but we also use gestation to talk about ideas. If you've been vaguely
thinking about starting a revolution for the last year, then that idea

 5. объять (comprehend, fill)
 6. охватывать (cover, embrace, span, comprise, grasp, comprehend)
 7. включать (include, turn on, switch on, comprise, involve, comprehend)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. grasp mentally; understand.
    "he couldn't comprehend her reasons for marrying Lovat"
 2. include, comprise, or encompass.
    "a divine order comprehending all men"

To comprehend something is to understand it, like when you have to
read a difficult passage more than once in order to comprehend it.

When you comprehend something, you grasp its meaning. Comprehend is a
verb that originates from the Latin word comprehendere, which means
“catch or seize.” When an idea is clear to you and you understand it
completely, you comprehend it, like doing extra problems to make sure
you comprehend a difficult algebra rule, or finding it hard to
comprehend why someone would paint his house neon yellow.

Then,
suddenly about half way through the book or class, the explanations
switch from easy to comprehend to ‘you have to be a genius to get it!’
It goes from ‘You got this!’ to ‘ What the heck are they talking

noun
 1. стимул (stimulus, incentive, impetus, inducement, stimulant, drive)
 2. побуждение (motivation, impulse, prompting, urge, motive, incentive)

adjective
 1. побудительный (incentive, impellent, urging)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a thing that motivates or encourages one to do something.
    "there is no incentive for customers to conserve water"

If your mom wants you to mow the lawn but you don't feel like it, she
might offer to treat you to ice cream after as an incentive. An
incentive is something that stimulates you to take action or work
harder.

This noun dates back to Middle English, from Late Latin incentivum,
from incentivus "stimulating." In Latin, incentivus meant "setting the
tune," from incinere "to sing." The related English verb is
incentivize. The less common verb incent was first used in the early
1980s, and has been criticized as business jargon.

Also, it really helps if
you have incentive such as a project or goal to program.

 3. продольная погибь (sheer)

verb
 1. отклоняться от курса (yaw, sag, sheer)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. nothing other than; unmitigated (used for emphasis).
    "she giggled with sheer delight"
 2. (especially of a cliff or wall) perpendicular or nearly so.
    "the sheer ice walls"
 3. (of a fabric) very thin; diaphanous.
    "sheer white silk chiffon"

adverb

    "the ridge fell sheer, in steep crags"
 2. completely; right.
    "she went sheer forward when the door was open"

verb
 1. (typically of a boat or ship) swerve or change course quickly.
    "the boat sheered off to beach further up the coast"

noun
 1. a very fine or diaphanous fabric or article.
    "Quick to sew in less than two hours, you can sew this shrug in a variety of fabrics: sheers - such as georgette and chiffon - shantungs, linen, crepe, even velvet."
 2. a sudden deviation from a course, especially by a boat.
    "The vessel apparently, through something having gone wrong with the steering gear, took a sudden sheer to port, ran out of the channel and grounded on the edge of it."

If people can see through your shirt, it's sheer. This can also mean
something steep, like a cliff, or anything extreme, like sheer nerve.

This word has several meanings, but they're all extreme. A sheer
(see-through) shirt is an extreme way to dress — climbing a sheer
cliff is almost impossible. If your car sheers, it swerves sharply,
and you might crash. Maybe you've met all these meanings in a single
nightmare: When the sheer cloth blew over your face as you drove, you
lost control and the car began to sheer, filling you with sheer terror
as you went over the sheer cliff.

I’m too lazy to use C for everything, and in terms of sheer
productivity, I’ll take Java, but I think C was (and is) the greater
innovation, it completely defines the computing landscape we’re in
today.

уместный

adjective
 1. уместный (relevant, pertinent, opportune, apt, germane, apposite)
 2. подходящий (suitable, appropriate, right, suited, fitting, pertinent)
 3. имеющий отношение (concerned, pertinent)

noun
 1. принадлежности (accessories, materials, belongings, gear, paraphernalia, pertinent)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. relevant or applicable to a particular matter; apposite.
    "she asked me a lot of very pertinent questions"

Something pertinent is relevant and on-point. If you give your best
friend pertinent advice, that means the advice is appropriate for the
situation.

Something pertinent is related to the current topic or situation — and
probably helpful too. If you're in math class and you make a comment
about World War I, that's likely not pertinent. If you're in music
class and you talk about a cello, that probably is pertinent.
Pertinent things are appropriate and logical. In most situations,
people like to get comments and questions that are pertinent —
anything else can just seem like a distraction.

But this approach is pertinent for testing file content and not
   suitable for literate programming itself.

  [2017-02-08 Wed 09:06]
  
  A buoy is a floating marker that indicates the presence of underwater
  hazards, channels, or places for tying up boats. When buoy is a verb,
  it can mean to float like a buoy, literally or figuratively. Winning
  an award could buoy your spirits as if you are floating with pride.
  
  The verb buoy can mean "boost or increase." There aren't many things
  that will buoy your confidence as much as repeated compliments on how
  great your new haircut looks. Imagine seeing water buoy up an enormous
  swan, or the wind buoy up a kite. A more figurative meaning of buoy is
  to cheer or lift someone's spirits. One way to remember buoy's unusual
  spelling is the phrase, "Boats usually opt to steer around a buoy."
  
  At the bottom was a little inset which read:
  CAUTION: AS the buoys marking the shoals are often out of position,
  mariners are cautioned to be on their guard when navigating these shores.
* demolishes :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 17:33]

Demolish means “completely destroy,” as a wrecking ball might demolish
a building, or as hanging out with one’s parents might, supposedly,
demolish a teenager’s reputation.

In casual speech, demolish can also mean “devour,” as a group of
hungry teenagers might demolish a pizza. The noun form of demolish is
demolition, which often implies destruction by means of explosives.
Demolish combines the prefix de-, which can mean “undo,” with the
Latin verb moliri, meaning “to build" — which makes sense if you are
thinking of 'undoing a building' with explosives!

The other person will say something that I hadn’t considered, or that
hadn’t occurred to me, that utterly demolishes my point.
* fungible :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 17:35]
заменяемый

adjective
 1. заменяемый (replaceable, commutable, substitutable, fungible)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. (of goods contracted for without an individual specimen being specified) able to replace or be replaced by another identical item; mutually interchangeable.
    "money is fungible—money that is raised for one purpose can easily be used for another"

If something is fungible, you can exchange it for something else. Why
is it that you can trade a twenty dollar bill for a ten and two fives?
Because money's fungible!

The “g” in fungible is pronounced like a “j” or like the “g” in
“fudge,” though fungible things aren't always tasty. Fungible comes
from a Latin phrase meaning “to serve in place of” and that's what
something that's fungible does: serves in place of what it's exchanged
for.

They’re fungible.
* silo :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 17:39]

A silo is a cylindrical tower used for bulk storage, like grain silos
that stand tall near farms. Another kind of silo is harder to see —
military silos are underground.

Farming and war are pretty different, but they both involve silos. You
may have seen a silo if you've ever visited a farm. A silo is a tall
tower with a cylindrical (rounded) shape. The silo holds anything the
farmer needs to store in bulk, especially feed for the animals. Other,
non-farm silos hold material such as cement or coal. The military type
of silo holds something more dangerous: missiles. These silos store
the missiles underground until they’re fired.

Specialists stay in one silo, becoming THE authority in that silo for their company.

The annual flower market was going on and the soldiers put carnations in their

* extracurricular :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 17:49]

Something extracurricular takes place in addition to your regular
school or work duties. Being involved in extracurricular activities in
high school — like sports or journalism — can help you get accepted to
the college of your choice.

Extracurricular is a combination of the Latin prefix extra- meaning
"on the outside" and the word curriculum, meaning "a running, course,
career." Something that is extracurricular is on the outside of your
course or career. When you get involved in an extracurricular
activity, you are going outside of what's expected. Extracurricular
can also refer to a spouse's adulterous activities, taking place
outside of their marriage commitment.

You have to say yes to extracurricular activities (or you can’t go to college), you have to say yes to going to
college (even if you have to no idea what you want to do with your life), you’re pressured to say “yes, I agree that’s
outrageous!”
* toll :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 17:52]

A toll is a payment made for something. To drive on some highways,
drivers have to pay a toll when they exit.

Toll comes from the Greek word for "tax," telos. When a fee is charged
for the privilege of driving on a road or crossing a bridge, it's
called a toll. Another kind of toll is the charge to make a long
distance telephone call. Occasionally, toll refers to a different kind
of cost — a loss of human life: the human toll of an earthquake or
war. Finally, there's the toll, or deep ringing sound, of a bell.

It took a toll on me.
* lulling :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 20:10]

See lull, think "calm." It could be the noun form (like "the lull
before the storm") or the verb: one can lull someone by calming them
(as in lulling a baby to sleep with a lullaby).

The noun lull is often used in relation to a storm, but the term has a
broader meaning as well. Lull can be used to describe any temporary
period of calm or diminished activity, like the quiet time before the
lunch rush in a restaurant or the brief period of tranquility before
the doors open for a pre-Christmas sale. The word's verb form means
"to soothe or to make someone feel relaxed." When used as a verb lull
can turn deceptive, and it is often used to convey a false sense of
security.

b.frob() can be as
broken as ever, but still line coverage can read 100% thus lulling developer into false sense of security.

* corollary                                                           :Quora:
[2017-02-21 Tue 09:21]

Corollary describes a result that is the natural consequence of
something else. You could say that your weight gain is a corollary of
the recent arrival of a bakery across the street from your house.

The noun corollary describes an action's consequence, such as having
to study more, a corollary to getting a bad grade. The word is often
seen with the prepositions “to” or “of," as in “a corollary to fortune
is fame.” Math enthusiasts may already be familiar with the word
corollary, which can be used more formally to describe a new proof or
proposition that follows naturally from an established one.

Corollary: Stand next to the smartest person in the room.
* abundance                                                           :Quora:
[2017-02-21 Tue 09:23]

To have an abundance of something is to have more than you need. It's
often used to describe positive qualities, such as "an abundance of
love."

Abundance is the opposite of scarcity. An abundance of wealth is a ton
of cash. An abundance of friends sounds like a good thing, but it can
get overwhelming when it comes to scheduling time to hang out or
buying gifts. This noun comes from to us from the mid-14th century
French, via the Latin abundantia, meaning "fullness, plenty."

Persistence + Love = Abundance
* ingenious :Quora:
[2017-02-21 Tue 10:12]

Something ingenious shows creativity and inventiveness. If someone
compares you to Einstein, they're implying that you, too, are
ingenious.

Ingenious comes from the Latin words for inborn talent. It started off
meaning someone who was talented or incredibly smart, but has come to
mean inventive, or clever. If you can solve 146,392 * 27,453 in your
head, people might call you a math genius. But if you come up with a
way to turn water into fuel, you will be praised as ingenious.
Ingenious can also describe thing, like an ingenious device.

* dealt :Quora:
[2017-02-21 Tue 10:13]

"Let's make a deal," a friend might say to you. That means he wants to
make an agreement on something. If you pay for the gas, for example,
he'll pay for the food. What a deal!

Ready to deal with all the meanings of the word deal?! You can deal a
deck of cards. You can make a business deal. You can strike a deal.
You can try to deal with an unfortunate situation. You can score a
deal in the bargain basement. Deal comes from the Old English dǣlan,
meaning "divide" and "participate."

A good poker player plays the hand he or she is dealt.
* peculiar :Quora:
[2017-02-22 Wed 17:55]

Something peculiar is notably unusual. If your friend starts saying
strange things you don't understand, ask her why she's suddenly become
peculiar.

Peculiar comes from the Latin peculiaris, meaning one's own, or
personal. In English, it originally meant belonging to one person,
private, like your fondness for your peculiar hairbrush. It also had
the meaning of something unlike others, special, or remarkable.
Eventually we mostly stopped using it for belongings, instead using
peculiar to mean unusual or odd.

Generally speaking, the earlier chapters describe features of Emacs
Lisp that have counterparts in many programming languages, and later
chapters describe features that are peculiar to Emacs Lisp or relate
specifically to editing.
* idiosyncrasies :Quora:
[2017-02-22 Wed 18:04]

If a person has an idiosyncrasy, he or she has a little quirk, or a
funny behavior, that makes him or her different. If you only say
goodbye in French, never in English, that would be an idiosyncrasy.

Idio seems like it means stupid, but really it is Latin for "one's
own," as an idiosyncrasy is one's own particular, usually odd,
behavior. Putting salt in your hot chocolate or needing the light on
to sleep or tapping your head while you think are all idiosyncrasies.
A machine such as a DVD player has an idiosyncrasy if you have to do
something weird to it to make it work like having to bang it on the
back left-hand side to stop it from skipping.

Dozens of Lisp implementations have been built over the years, each
with its own idiosyncrasies.
* irrespective :Quora:
[2017-02-22 Wed 18:15]

The adverb irrespective means regardless or in spite, and it is almost
always followed by the word "of." Irrespective of your desire to stay
inside on a bitterly cold day, the dog still needs to be walked.

Irrespective is a combination of the Latin roots ir, meaning not, and
respectivus, meaning having regard for. The word irrespective is
sometimes confused with its synonym regardless, giving rise in the
early 20th century to the nonstandard word irregardless, which is
considered an error by most grammarians, irrespective of how many
people use irregardless in their everyday speech.

Examples in this manual indicate printed text with ‘⊣’, irrespective
of where that text goes.

noun
 1. the fraudulent practice of adding unauthorized charges to a customer's phone bill.
    "Cramming occurs when a company places unauthorized, misleading or deceptive charges on your phone bill, and it happens all the time."

verb
 1. completely fill (a place or container) to the point that it appears to be overflowing.
    "the ashtray by the bed was crammed with cigarette butts"
 2. study intensively over a short period of time just before an examination.
    "lectures were called off so students could cram for finals"

To cram is to crowd or stuff people or things into a limited amount of
space. You might be tempted to cram your mouth full of your mom's
chocolate chip cookies, especially if they just came out of the oven
and are still warm and gooey.

You can cram yourself with food, or cram your books onto a shelf
that's not quite big enough to hold them. A writer might cram one book
with dozens of characters, or you could cram homemade pancakes with
blueberries. Another way to cram is to study for a test all in one
session: "I haven't studied at all yet — I'll have to stay up tonight
and cram." The Old English root, crammian, means "stuff something into
something else."

After that you keep learning on the frigging as needed basis instead of
cramming textbooks to pass algorithmic interviews.
* notoriety :Quora:
[2017-02-24 Fri 20:45]

Notoriety is fame you get from doing something bad or being part of a
misfortune or scandal. Just remember: Notoriety's not al-righty.
Charles Manson earned notoriety for his grisly crimes.

In our celebrity culture, it's hard not to think that seizing your 15
minutes of fame is worth the shame of earning it through stupidity,
scandal, or evil. (See: people's motives for going on reality
television.) The rest of us can comfort ourselves with in our
boringness that most people who become notorious fade from the public
mind quickly.

There are a few ways to do this,
 but a copule are 1) working for others first and building a
 clientele, or 2) gaining notoriety on the internet through a blog,
 or as the author/contributor of an open source library.

 1. инвариант (invariant)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a function, quantity, or property that remains unchanged when a specified transformation is applied.
    "For example, in Euclidean geometry, the relevant invariants are embodied in quantities that are not altered by geometric transformations such as rotations, dilations, and reflections."

A friend of mine observed that people who have a CS background have a

* rehearsing :Quora:
[2017-02-26 Sun 14:54]

 2. повторять (repeat, reiterate, replicate, iterate, rehearse, recapitulate)
 3. перечислять (list, enumerate, itemize, recount, recite, catalog)

 5. спеваться (rehearse)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. practice (a play, piece of music, or other work) for later public performance.
    "we were rehearsing a play"

When you rehearse, you practice something. You and your cast mates
will need to rehearse for several weeks before you'll be ready to
perform the entire two hours and forty-five minutes of the musical
"Hamilton."

A new teacher might rehearse before his first day teaching math to
ninth graders, and you'll want to rehearse before you sing the
national anthem on the field before a baseball game begins. If you're
nervous about something, like asking someone to the prom, you might
rehearse it in your mind. At the root of rehearse is the Old French
word rehercier, which means both "go over again," and "rake and turn
over the soil."

живость

noun
 1. живость (liveliness, vivacity, vitality, alacrity, agility, life)
 2. оживленность (vivacity, sparkle, glow, ginger)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. (especially in a woman) the quality of being attractively lively and animated.
    "he was struck by her vivacity, humor and charm"

If someone says you're full of vivacity, that means you have high
spirits and are full of life. Your vivacity makes you a great comedic
actor because you attack the stage with endless energy.

Vivacity comes from the Latin vīvācitāt-, meaning "life force," and
shares a root with the word vital. You may know from medical dramas
that if someone's vital signs are not good, that means he's dying. But
if he is full of vivacity, that means the opposite: he's totally
energetically fully alive! If you don't have much vivacity, don't
become a motivational speaker.

 2. отдалять (alienate, distance, estrange)
 3. отвращать (turn away, avert, ward off, alienate, forfend, fend off)
 4. заставлять отвернуться (alienate)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. cause (someone) to feel isolated or estranged.
    "an urban environment that would alienate its inhabitants"
 2. transfer ownership of (property rights) to another person or group.
    "Consequently, unless the plaintiff alienated his ownership, he has been the owner of the case since it came into being."

When you alienate people, you make them stop liking or caring about
you. Show up at a conference of cat lovers with a sign around your
neck that says, "I hate kittens," and you'll learn firsthand what that
means.

Back in the days of Latin, before the word alien came to mean little
green men from outer space, it described something or someone that was
foreign or different or not known: an alien custom, an alien nation.
When you alienate people, you make them WISH you were an alien, or at
least that they could send you to the moon.

Challenging people when you don’t know what they
know is a surefire way to alienate any potential employer.

* diatribe :Quora:

диатриба

noun
 1. диатриба (diatribe)
 2. обличительная речь (diatribe, invective, philippic)
 3. резкая обличительная речь (diatribe)
 4. уничтожающая критика (destructive criticism, diatribe)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a forceful and bitter verbal attack against someone or something.
    "a diatribe against the Roman Catholic Church"

It's pretty overwhelming when you ask your friend a seemingly
innocuous question, like "Do you like hot dogs?" and she unleashes a
diatribe about the evils of eating meat. A diatribe is an angry,
critical speech.

This noun has its roots in the Greek diatribē, "pastime or lecture,"
from diatrībein, "to waste time or wear away," combining dia-,
"thoroughly," and trībein, "to rub." So the origin of the word
diatribe is connected to both serious study and the spending or
wasting of time. With most diatribes, the speaker thinks he's well
informed and knows something the listener doesn't, while to most
listeners the diatribe is so angry and unhinged that it's just a waste
of time.

* relish :Quora:
/ˈrɛlɪʃ/
[2017-03-01 Wed 17:05]

Relish isn't just a hotdog topping. The verb relish means to enjoy
something immensely. You may relish eating the relish on your hotdog,
or you may relish taking an afternoon nap.

The word relish has been around since the 16th century and comes to us
from the French, who are pretty good at indulging and savoring. When
at a dinner party, win points with your host by sighing happily after
each bite to show just how much you relish the meal. Relish is also a
kind of spicy or savory condiment, the stuff you slather on hotdogs or
hamburgers. So if you're fickle when it comes to pickles, you might
ask them to hold the relish.

 Mary exclaimed as she ate with a relish the appetizing soup.

* modicum :Quora:

Незначительный

 1. чуточка (modicum, touch, ounce, dash, smidgen, taste)
 2. очень маленькое количество (modicum, stiver)
 3. небольшие средства (modicum)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a small quantity of a particular thing, especially something considered desirable or valuable.
    "his statement had more than a modicum of truth"

If you want to describe a small amount of something, try modicum. If
you have a modicum of interest in something, you are a little bit
interested.

Modicum comes from the Latin modicus, for moderate, and modus, for
measure. We often use it to mean "any at all," as if "If you had a
modicum of sense (i.e. any sense at all), you'd be able to see that
the pencil you've spent the last five minutes looking for is tucked
behind your ear."

Hence, our book comes with a modicum of software support: a language
in which to write down programs and a program development environment
with which programs are edited like word documents and run on concrete
inputs.

* allotted :Quora:

Отводится

 2. предназначенный (designed, destined, allotted, consigned)
 3. отчисленный (allotted)

 1. give or apportion (something) to someone as a share or task.
    "equal time was allotted to each"

Allotted means given as a share of something. Hopefully you will be
happy with your allotted share of candy on Halloween.

Something that's allotted is distributed, or shared, like your
allotted number of pizza slices. It can also mean your share of a job;
on family clean-up day, your allotted task could be taking out the
garbage. The Germanic word loter, "lot" or "share," is at the root of
allotted. A plus loter form the Old French aloter, "to divide into
lots." When you're spelling allotted remember to double up the ls and
the ts.

    "The mass of the top hamper must be consciously balanced against the tremendous beam."

verb
 1. hinder or impede the movement or progress of.
    "their work is hampered by lack of funds"

Anything that hampers slows progress or makes it difficult to do
something. You might think that the presence of your parents hampers
your ability to look cool.

The verb hamper is for those times when normal progress is slow but
not shut down completely. Hamper often describes travel during bad
weather, like icy conditions that could hamper holiday travel. Hamper
means "slow going." You may have heard of noun form of hamper, a
container for holding dirty laundry: If your hamper is full, the need
to do laundry could hamper your plans of going out and having fun.

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. strong, healthy, and full of energy.
    "And the pope, we're told, kept up his full, vigorous schedule this Christmas Eve, despite his frail health."

Anything vigorous is done with force and energy. Vigorous exercise
makes you sweat, and a vigorous denial makes someone else sweat.

Vigorous is a description for something strong or enthusiastic. It
comes from the French word vigour, meaning "liveliness, activity." An
active, physically energetic person is vigorous, and mental activities
can be vigorous too, when they require a lot of mental effort. A
vigorous argument doesn’t have to include physical wrestling; it just
might involve verbal sparring.

He may manage to find out, however, that a mathematics problem may be
as much fun as a crossword puzzle, or that vigorous mental work may be
an exercise as desirable as a fast game of tennis.

When you are displeased by something and you let your gloomy mood
show, you're sulking. Do you want to bake another cake, or are you
going to sulk all day about the one you dropped?

When you say someone sulks, the tone of the word suggests the person
is overdoing it. You wouldn't accuse a widow of sulking at her
husband's funeral, because she has a good reason to be sad and gloomy.
Instead of sulking because you messed up your tuba solo during the
concert, why not put your energy into practice? Or switch to violin.

Appease often implies abandoning your moral principles to satisfy the

peace, or be reconciled," from the phrase "a paisier," which combines
a-, or "to," and pais, "peace," from the Latin pax.

Gothic novels, horror movies, and crime dramas don't shy away from
showing gruesome scenes of death, pictures that inspire fright and
repulsion. Synonyms include "ghastly," "grisly," "loathsome," and
"macabre."

Once upon a time, English contained a variety of words related to
gruesome. The verb grue meant "to shudder," just as its Middle Dutch
source gruwen did. Grueful and grueing also conveyed the sense of
shivering with horror and disgust. All of these variations have been
lost leaving us only with gruesome. Texting while driving has caused
many gruesome accidents that you might not want to hear the gruesome
details of. Although if you like gruesome movies, you might want to
know.

The sacrifices themselves were famously gruesome.
* gory :Quora:
[2017-03-10 Fri 21:16]
Горький

adjective
 1. окровавленный (bloody, gory, red, ensanguined)
 2. кровопролитный (sanguinary, slaughterous, sanguineous, gory, internecine)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. involving or showing violence and bloodshed.
    "a gory horror film"

Use the word gory to describe something that features a lot of
bloodshed and violence, like a horror movie in which victims are axed
to death by a madman. Some people love gory movies like that, and
others refuse to watch them.

Something that is gory often involves both violence and bloodshed, but
it can also describe something that is merely blood, like the gory
photographs depicting a root canal procedure in a dental assistant
textbook. Gory can describe unpleasant, embarrassing things, like
saying of your brother’s bad behavior over the holidays, “I’ll spare
you the gory details about his meltdown at the family Christmas
party.”

By the end of the Aztecs’ heyday, when the Spaniards arrived (bringing
their own brand of gruesomeness), the sun cult had escalated to a gory
climax.
* wielded :Quora:
[2017-03-10 Fri 21:19]
Владеющий

verb
 1. владеть (own, possess, hold, master, wield, command)
 2. иметь в руках (wield)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. hold and use (a weapon or tool).
    "a masked raider wielding a handgun"

If you wield a tool or a weapon, you handle it effectively. Picture a
gallant knight wielding a sword or a skillful chef wielding a whisk.

You don't just have to wield something physical; you can also wield or
exert influence or authority. Wield is frequently followed by the word
power. If you were a king, you could wield great power in your kingdom
— exerting your influence over everything from food rations to castle
upkeep. As it is, though, you might just wield power over your pet
goldfish. Note: wield follows the i before e, except after c spelling
rule.

Four priests would hold the victim down over the altar, while a fifth
priest wielded the knife.
* lichens :Quora:
[2017-03-11 Sat 13:10]
Лишайники

noun
 1. лишайник (lichen, moss)
 2. лишай (lichen, herpes, tetter, dartre)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a simple slow-growing plant that typically forms a low crustlike, leaflike, or branching growth on rocks, walls, and trees.
    "A profusion of mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns cover the woodland floor and festoon tree trunks and branches."
 2. a skin disease in which small pimples or bumps occur close together.
    "The white buccal lesions of oral lichen planus may necessitate biopsy to exclude leukoplakia, candidiasis, and secondary syphilis."

Have you ever walked through the woods and seen a crusty-looking shelf
growing out of a tree? That is actually a lichen, a complex organism
comprised of a fungus and its partner algae, the two parts
interweaving to form one.

The word lichen appeared around 1600, and was drawn from the Greek
leikhēn, meaning "what eats around itself." This is a good meaning for
what the word represents, as lichen is comprised of fungus cells that
literally surround the algae cells to form a mutualistic bond. Because
of the crusty look of a lichen, the name has also been given to a
number of skin diseases that present the same patchy look as the
fungus-algae.

This proverb refers to what is well known about mosses and lichens
- that they are slow-growing organisms that don't thrive on
disturbance.
* thrive :Quora:
[2017-03-11 Sat 13:11]
Процветать

verb
 1. процветать (prosper, thrive, flourish, do)
 2. преуспевать (succeed, do well, prosper, get on, thrive, flourish)
 3. разрастаться (thrive, flourish, swell)
 4. буйно разрастаться (thrive, wanton)
 5. буйно расти (thrive)
 6. пышно расти (thrive, flourish)
 7. пышно разрастаться (thrive)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. (of a child, animal, or plant) grow or develop well or vigorously.
    "the new baby thrived"

To thrive is to do well or flourish. If your new cookie delivery
business thrives, you'll be rolling in dough — not literally, of
course.

The verb thrive means to flourish or grow vigorously, and it can be
applied to something like a business or to something or someone's
actual health. Plants can thrive in a greenhouse, and children can
thrive if they eat well and exercise. Thriving can also be used more
figuratively — "The women thrived on gossip; they loved knowing who
was dating or divorcing whom."
* abiding :Quora:
[2017-03-11 Sat 21:26]
Постоянный

adjective
 1. неизменный (unaltered, constant, unchangeable, immutable, invariable, abiding)
 2. постоянный (constant, standing, permanent, continuous, regular, abiding)
 3. прочный (lasting, strong, durable, solid, firm, abiding)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. (of a feeling or a memory) lasting a long time; enduring.
    "he had an abiding respect for her"

verb

    "I said I would abide by their decision"
 2. be unable to tolerate (someone or something).

 3. (of a feeling or a memory) continue without fading or being lost.
    "One memory abides of when, at a very tender age and against the tide, he took up Irish dancing."

Something abiding sticks around, lasting a long time. Abiding is
usually used with feelings and memories — as in your abiding love for
Elmo.

Abiding comes from the Old English abidan, gebidan meaning "remain,
wait, delay, remain behind." It's a word that's typically used to
describe a feeling or memory that remains behind or lingers in your
mind a while. You can have an abiding faith in God, or an abiding
respect for war veterans or an abiding passion. "Law-abiding citizens"
are those people who stick strictly to the law. They always use the
crosswalk and pay their taxes on time.

* wrath :Quora:
[2017-03-15 Wed 17:10]
гнев

noun
 1. гнев (anger, wrath, rage, fury, ire, passion)
 2. ярость (fury, rage, anger, wrath, ire, rampage)
 3. глубокое возмущение (wrath, strong feelings, strong feeling)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. extreme anger (chiefly used for humorous or rhetorical effect).
    "he hid his pipe for fear of incurring his father's wrath"

Wrath is great anger that expresses itself in a desire to punish
someone: Noah saw the flood as a sign of the wrath of God.

Wrath is also used figuratively of things that behave in a violent
way: Earthquakes are the wrath of the sea. This noun and the
corresponding adjective wrathful are in literary use but are formal or
old-fashioned words, that crop up in fantasy fiction or movies set in
prehistoric times.

 3. ставить вопрос на обсуждение (moot)

noun
 1. собрание граждан (moot)
 2. учебный судебный процесс (moot)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. subject to debate, dispute, or uncertainty, and typically not admitting of a final decision.
    "whether the temperature rise was mainly due to the greenhouse effect was a moot point"

noun
 1. an assembly held for debate, especially in Anglo-Saxon and medieval times.
    "Even if, as some have supposed, the manor court, or hall moot , had Anglo-Saxon forebears, it was an institution that must have changed out of all recognition after 1100."
 2. a mock trial set up to examine a hypothetical case as an academic exercise.
    "The last time I was there, nearly a decade ago, I was a law student competing in the Jessup International Law moot ."

verb
 1. raise (a question or topic) for discussion; suggest (an idea or possibility).
    "Sylvia needed a vacation, and a trip to Ireland had been mooted"

When a point is moot, it's too trivial to think about. If your
basketball team loses by 40 points, the bad call by the official in
the first quarter is moot: it isn't important.

Though moot can mean to debate endlessly without any clear decision or
to think about something carefully, it most often describes ideas and
arguments that don't really matter. If your plane is crashing, whether
or not your socks match is a moot point. When someone accuses you of
making a moot point, he's basically saying, "Come on! Let's talk about
what's important." As with so many things, people don't always agree
on what's moot and what's not.

That's a moot point however, Franklin and Poor Richard being one and
the same.

Refugees from war-torn countries encounter terrible adversity.

Adversity, a noun which has been part of the English language for over

and figuratively "hostile or unfavorable." When things seem against
you — circumstances or a stoke of bad luck — you are facing adversity.
Sometimes people use a form of the phrase "turning adversity into
opportunity." This refers to the ability some people or companies have
to take a bad situation and make it into a successful one.

 3. избыток (excess, surplus, abundance, glut, overflow, exuberance)

    "a sense of youthful exuberance"

Use exuberance to describe joyful enthusiasm and liveliness. You
appreciate the natural exuberance of small children, but you prefer to
enjoy it from a distance.

The noun exuberance comes from the adjective exuberant, which itself
came from a Latin word that originally described an overflowing supply
of milk from the udder of a cow or goat! The word still means
"overflowing," not with milk but with joy and enthusiasm. After your
winning home run, the fans ran onto the field and, in their
exuberance, carried you off on their shoulders . . . before you
touched home plate.

Richard Dawkins elucidates the wonders of the natural world

 2. расценивать (appraise, rate, cost)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. assess the value or quality of.
    "she stealthily appraised him in a pocket mirror"

When you buy a house someone will need to appraise its value before
you can get a mortgage. To appraise something is to figure out its
worth in the marketplace, on the field, or in the world of ideas.

To appraise the value of a friendship is difficult, but to appraise
the value of your grandfather’s pocket watch — just go to the pawn
shop. The verb appraise comes from the Late Latin word appretiare,
which means “value” or “estimate.” You can appraise your chances of
marrying royalty, which are probably slim. You can also appraise the
value of a quarterback on your fantasy football team by looking at the
statistics for his completed passes.

The word comes from its use in everyday language, “to ascertain the
value or amount of; to appraise”, according to ‘Webster’s New
Collegiate Dictionary’.

of their king or queen.

You might be expected to obey the rules your strict parents lay down,
or to obey the guidelines of a group or club you belong to. Religious
Christians obey God, and soldiers obey the direct orders their
commanding officers give them. To obey is to be obedient, and both
words come from the Latin obedire, which literally means "listen to,"
but is used to mean "pay attention to."

Islands. You wouldn't embark on a trip to the grocery store.

The verb embark can be used specifically to refer to boarding a ship

Excessive refers to something that is extra — usually in a negative
way. A 90-second drum solo in a two-minute song is excessive. Getting
down on your knees and kissing someone's feet to thank them for a
favor is excessive, unless they gave you their firstborn. Often this
means something that exceeds the bounds of good taste, or is
extravagant and inappropriately expensive. You should dress up for
dinner, but wearing a ball gown to a diner is excessive.

  twenty years of marriage you no longer like your husband, you may be
  able to work it out. If you feel hatred towards him, your differences
  may be irreconcilable.

  A thicket refers to a dense growth of bushes or trees — what you try
  to avoid by tending to the plants in your backyard.

  The word thicket comes from the word thick, which means close together
  or dense. If you are "thick as thieves," then you are close friends. A
  thicket is a growth of trees, bushes, or shrubbery that is very close
  together, often making it difficult for people to walk through or for

* apex :Quora:
  [2017-04-04 Tue 14:20]

  When there's no mountain left to climb and nothing but blue sky
  above, you know you've reached the highest peak — the apex.

  Apex can mean the highest point in a literal sense, like climbing to
  the apex of the Eiffel Tower for a fabulous view of Paris. It also
  can be used to mean the highest point in a figurative sense. An
  actor who wins an Oscar can say she's reached the apex of her
  career. If you're describing more than one high point, you could add
  an -es to form the plural apexes, but apices would also be correct.
  And if you're a botanist, you'd probably use apex to describe the
  tip of a flower or leaf.

  If there are any weight vectors that get the right answer for all
  cases, they lie in a hyper-cone with its apex at the origin.

* nascent :Quora:

  Nascent describes the birth or beginning of something, for example a

  future promise, like the nascent government of a new country.

  You’re in the future looking back at the first time you learned the
  definition of the word nascent. Your nascent efforts to use the word
  felt awkward, but you quickly felt comfortable with it, especially
  after you learned how to pronounce it: “NAY-sent.” Now you use the

  A setback is an event that makes you lose progress or keeps you from

  stitches would be a big setback.

  If warring countries are negotiating a treaty, a sudden resurgence
  of fighting would be a huge setback for their peace plan. And if

  party, knocking the frosted cake onto the floor would also be a

  [2017-04-09 Sun 18:11]

  When you boast you are bragging about yourself and your
  accomplishments (or maybe those of your family), often to the
  boredom and annoyance of your audience.

  Used as either a noun or a verb, boast usually suggests
  exaggeration, vanity, or pride. Along those lines, English poet Sir
  Thomas Overbury, who died in 1613, once said, "The man who has
  nothing to boast of but his illustrious ancestry is like the potato
  — the best part underground." However, the word can also be used in
  a positive way: a town can boast a new library, or a school can
  boast a high graduation rate.

  In comparison, MATLAB boasts a large number of additional toolboxes,
  notably Simulink, whereas NumPy is intrinsically integrated with
  Python, a more modern and complete programming language.

* contiguous :Quora:
  [2017-04-09 Sun 18:27]

  Use the adjective contiguous when you want to describe one thing
  touching another thing, or next to it but not actually touching.

  Things that are contiguous are near or next to but not actually
  touching and yet they are also defined as "touching, sharing a
  border." You can use this adjective to describe people or things
  related to and nearby others. It comes from the Latin word
  contiguus, which means pretty much the same thing, "bordering upon."
  Because the word has two meanings that are very similar but not
  always the same it can be a bit confusing. This is an example of
  what's called "semantic ambiguity," when something can mean more
  than one thing or a word or phrase is not precise.

  These circumstances originate from the fact that NumPy's arrays must
  be views on contiguous memory buffers.

* revenue                                                             :Quora:
[2017-04-24 Mon 17:19]

Revenue is money earned by a business, or income received by the
government from taxes. The government is always interested in dreaming
up new sources of revenue, and so is the average head of a company
unless she doesn't want to be the head anymore.

Revenue is from a French word meaning "to return or come back," and
dollar returns are always a welcome thing. Declining advertising
revenue will doom your website, no matter how great it is. If your
lemonade stand is not making a profit, you might consider lowering
costs. Maybe you could get cheaper lemonade mix? Or you might look for
more creative and exciting ways to increase revenue––like raiding the
pantry for cookies you can sell as well.

Since I started the business in early 2015, two years ago,
we’ve had $26 million in revenues and $3.6 million in
profits.
* excess :Quora:
[2017-04-24 Mon 17:22]

Excess is too much of something, like big-time overindulgence. Eating
to excess makes your stomach hurt, and spending to excess means you
can't pay your credit card bills.

Excess comes from the Latin word excessus meaning, "go out, going
beyond the bounds of reason," like eating and spending in excess. (Not
so reasonable.) Although it spends most of its time as a noun, it can
also be an adjective to describe "more than is required or needed,"
like when excess water spills over the top of the bathtub, or those
excess pounds spill over the top of your jeans.

A) Some people have a huge excess of “Something”: empty car
seats (Uber), empty rooms (Airbnb), excess knowledge (a
newsletter or course you can start), etc.
* cusp :Quora:
[2017-04-25 Tue 20:51]

A cusp in geometry is the point where two curves meet. It's a kind of
transition. If you're on the cusp of manhood, you’re not quite grown
up, but you’re definitely not a little boy anymore either.

The word comes from Latin cuspis, "point." You'll see lots of cusps in
Gothic churches — a point where two arches meet, or where decorative
curves meet to form a point. The little points that stick out on the
surface of your teeth that are flat on top — the ones you use for
grinding — are also called cusps. Those teeth right behind your canine
teeth but before your molars have two cusps, and they're called
bicuspids.

Ooh, I’m on this cusp.
* cocky :Quora:
[2017-04-25 Tue 20:53]

Cocky means "overly self-confident," like a cocky announcement at the
beginning of the season that your soccer team will win the
championship without even trying.

Cocky originally meant "lecherous," or lustful, but evolved to mean
"arrogantly pert" in the 1700s. Cocky people don't usually stop at
bragging about themselves — they'll cut you in line at the grocery
store, because they think they are too important to wait. Synonyms for
cocky are conceited, egotistical, and the phrase "full of
himself/herself."

I’m not as confident and cocky as I was in my 20’s.
* coarse :Quora:
[2017-04-25 Tue 20:55]

Coarse can mean rough to the touch or vulgar. It's good to have coarse
sand paper, but not good to have coarse manners.

Do you lick your dinner plate, wipe your nose on your sleeve, and
generally behave like an oaf? No, of course not. You're the kind of
person who reads online dictionaries. But if you did do any of things,
you'd be coarse — that is, unrefined, boorish, and downright vulgar.
Coarse can apply to a wide variety of things other than behavior. If
something is of poor quality, cheap and inferior, it's considered
coarse.

Work wise, I get a lot less
recruitment calls or approaches than I used to, but I think
that is in no small part to being coarse with recruiters and
not being on LinkedIn (not staying around for post-Brexit
racism thank you very much - so I left) rather than being
definitively due to age.
* judicious :Quora:
[2017-04-29 Sat 17:14]

If you're judicious, you've got a good head on your shoulders and make
good decisions. Humpty Dumpty's decision to sit on a wall? NOT
judicious.

As its sound implies, judicious comes from the same Latin word from
which we get judge and judiciary, and not surprisingly a judicious
decision is one that only comes after all sides have been weighed up
and opposing points of view taken into consideration. Judicious
decisions are never split-second decisions.

* herrings :Quora:
[2017-04-29 Sat 17:14]

A herring is a small, silver fish. Most herring that's caught for food
is prepared by being smoked, salted, or pickled.

The majority of herring is caught in the Atlantic, though the fish is
found in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. Because
it's very high in the famously healthy Omega-3 fats, herring is
considered a healthful fish for people to eat. Herrings is also used
as bait for catching larger fish. Although the source of the word
herring is uncertain, many experts see a link to the Old English har,
or "gray."

* gulls :Quora:
[2017-04-29 Sat 17:14]

You know those birds that hang out by the ocean, and grab your
sandwich if you aren't paying attention? Those are gulls, also known
as sea gulls. Gulls are found in every continent, including
Antarctica.

The noun gull has two very distinct definitions. Gulls are shore
birds, of course, but lesser-used meaning of the word is "a person who
is easy to fool." Your little brother might be a gull if you can trick
him into doing your chores along with his own. You may know the
related word gullible, which describes a willingness to believe
anything, without questioning whether it is true.

* shear :Quora:
[2017-04-29 Sat 17:16]

A shear is a cutting implement that looks like a long pair of
scissors. Also like scissors, this form of the noun is usually plural.
You can cut metal, prune a tree, or cut up a chicken with shears.

In farming, when you remove wool from a sheep, goat, or even a llama,
you shear the animal. Most farmers shear their sheep once a year, but
the timing varies from farm to farm. The verb shear also means to
cause to break off or come apart with a cutting force. The wind during
a storm can blow hard enough to shear the tiles off a roof.

* occlusion :Quora:
[2017-04-29 Sat 17:18]

Occlusion is either the act of blocking something or a specific
blockage. There can be occlusions blocking the street or your
arteries. When dentists say occlusion, they’re talking about what your
teeth look like when your mouth is closed.

An occlusion blocks anything that flows, like cars, people, water, or
blood. You can say there's occlusion if a pipe is clogged. If you find
out a golf ball was in the pipe, the ball was an occlusion. This word
applies to things that block and the act of blocking. People have
heart attacks when there's occlusion in their arteries. An overturned
truck would be an occlusion on the highway. Occlusions are in the way.

* horrendously :Quora:
  [2017-05-02 Tue 16:21]

  Bad luck, an injury, a mistake, an unfortunate outfit, or a crime —
  anything can be called horrendous if it causes such dread or fear that
  you can barely even think about it.

  If you’ve ever encountered something horrendous, you won’t be
  surprised to learn that the word traces back to the Latin word
  horrere, meaning "to bristle with fear, shudder." That’s a good way to
  think about horrendous things — they cause you to shudder. You can use
  the word to describe any type of thing — people, ideas, actions, and
  so on — but save it for those things that are not merely bad but
  instead are truly horrifying.

  And even if we did know what program to write, it might be
  that it was a horrendously complicated program.
* stark :Quora:
  [2017-05-02 Tue 16:26]

  Stark means "complete or extreme," like the stark contrast between
  your music taste — punk and weird metal — and your mom's, with all her
  1950's doo-wop favorites.

  In describing a place, stark means "providing no shelter or
  sustenance." A barren desert or a room with no furniture or curtains
  is stark. It can also mean "severe, stern, or austere," like the
  stark beauty of the rocky cliffs in the west of Ireland. Stark can
  also be used to mean "totally." If you are called stark, raving mad,
  there's no question about it: you are acting completely crazy.

  And now massive amounts for computation are cheaper that paying
  someone to write a program for a specific task, so we can afford big
  complicated machine learning programs to produce these stark task
  specific systems for us.
* plausible :Quora:
  [2017-05-02 Tue 16:38]

  If something is plausible, it's reasonable or believable. Things that
  are plausible could easily happen. A woman becoming President is very
  plausible. A giraffe becoming President is not.

  Plausible things are not far-fetched at all. Things in fantasy
  stories — such as wizards, dragons, and unicorns — are not
  plausible. On the other hand, some things in science fiction stories
  might be plausible: who knows where spaceships will eventually go?
  If something really seems like it could happen, then it's plausible.
  One of the many tricky parts of life is figuring out what's
  plausible and what's not.

  So its, its errors tell you a lot about how it's doing it and
  they're very plausible errors.

  1. посещаемость (attendance)
  2. посещение (visit, attendance)
  3. присутствие (presence, attendance)
  4. обслуживание (service, maintenance, handling, attendance)
  5. аудитория (audience, classroom, auditorium, auditory, lecture hall, attendance)
  6. услуги (attendance)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. the action or state of going regularly to or being present at a place or event.
     "my attendance at church was very irregular"


  Attendance has to do with being present at something, like work or
  school. If you never miss a day, you have perfect attendance.

  The concept of attendance has to do with showing up: if you show up
  for school, then your attendance is not in question. When people
  miss school or work, they usually need a note from a doctor,
  explaining why they weren't in attendance. We can also say "The
  attendance was 100" if 100 people showed up to a meeting. If only
  three people out of 100 showed up though, you'd say, "Wow.
  Attendance was terrible."

  His attendance was poor at best and he dropped out after his junior
  year.

  опережать

  verb
  1. делать лучше, чем другой (outperform)

  DEFINITION

  verb
  1. perform better than.
     "an experienced employee will outperform the novice"


  To outperform is to accomplish something in a better or more
  impressive way that someone else. In a marathon, the younger runners
  usually outperform the very oldest ones.

  Whenever you surpass or beat the record of another person, you can
  say you outperform them. Experienced workers frequently outperform
  newer employees, and pundits like to worry aloud about students in
  other countries who outperform American kids on standardized tests.
  You can also say that an investment that makes more money
  outperforms a less profitable one.

  бестелесный

  adjective
  1. бестелесный (incorporeal, bodiless, immaterial, unsubstantial, unbodied)
  2. бесплотный (incorporeal, ethereal, discarnate, aethereal, unbodied)
  3. невещественный (immaterial, incorporeal, unsubstantial)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. not composed of matter; having no material existence.
     "ghostly presences and incorporeal beings"


  Something that has no material form or physical substance can be
  described as incorporeal. If you believe in spirits or ghosts that
  can't be touched or seen but only felt, then you believe in the
  incorporeal.

  Incorporeal comes from a combination of the Latin root words in-
  meaning "not" and corpus meaning "body." Combined they form
  incorporeus, meaning "without body," which is precisely what
  something incorporeal is. A haunted house is plagued by incorporeal,
  or immaterial spirits. You don't see them, but they are there,
  rattling windows, slamming doors, scaring the living daylights out
  of you.

  /ˌɛm pəˈθɛt ɪk/ 
  чуткий
  
  An empathetic person is someone who can share another person's
  feelings. If you tell an empathetic person that your heart is
  broken, she might touch her own heart and gaze at you sadly through
  moist eyes.

  Empathetic is a recent term; it comes from empathy, which was coined
  by the German philosopher Rudolf Lotze in 1858. Lotze believed that
  when you look at a work of art, you project your own sensibilities
  onto it. So if you feel sad when you see a painting of a woman
  weeping over a dying lover, that's because you can imagine what it's
  like to lose someone you love. To make the word, Lotze turned to the
  ancient Greek empatheia, which means "passion."

  adjective
  1. послушный (obedient, docile, tractable, good, biddable, obeying)
  2. сговорчивый (accommodating, pliable, amenable, tractable, manageable, appeasable)
  3. легко поддающийся обработке (tractable)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. (of a person or animal) easy to control or influence.
     "tractable dogs that have had some obedience training"


  If your little brother quietly obeys your instructions and waits for
  you at the food court while you and your friends wander around the
  mall, he's probably a tractable child, meaning he's obedient,
  flexible, and responds well to directions.

  Note the similarity between tractable and tractor. Both come from
  the Latin word tractare, which originally meant "to drag about." You
  can think of a tractable person as someone who can be dragged about
  easily, like a plow being dragged by a tractor.

  So with a generative model like this, if you get to observe what it
  produces, and you now try to infer what the hidden state was, in
  general that's very hard, but there's two types of hidden state
  model for which the computation is tractable.

  You should probably postpone dinner if your date's cold is
  contagious — that means it's easily spread and likely to get you
  sick.

  Contagious actually evolved from contagio, the Latin phrase for
  “contact." Those smart ancient Romans — they figured out that the
  sick and contagious can pass on their plague to those they touch or
  get close to. So the word contagious usually sends people running.
  But let’s not forget that a smile or good deed can be just as
  infectious as a cough!

  2. бесчувственный (unfeeling, insensible, senseless, insensate, tearless, inhuman)
  3. неразумный (irrational, unwise, silly, subhuman, inadvisable, insensate)
  4. бессмысленный (nonsensical, senseless, meaningless, pointless, mindless, insensate)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. lacking physical sensation.
     "a patient who was permanently unconscious and insensate"


  Insensate is a word to describe something without feelings or
  consciousness. Cars, computers, and stuffed animals are all
  insensate (though some of us occasionally project thoughts and
  personalities onto them).

  Insensate can also describe individuals who seem to lack the
  characteristically human emotions of kindness and generosity. A
  person who tears a stuffed animal out of the hands of a young child
  might be described as insensate. Another meaning of insensate is
  “lacking intelligence.” In short, insensate, in any sense of the
  word, is usually something that you don’t want to be.

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. a spoken word, statement, or vocal sound.
     "His bizarre word rhythm and gleeful disregard for punctuation makes even his most banal utterances sound dramatic."


  An utterance is a bit of spoken language. It could be anything from
  "Ugh!" to a full sentence.

  To utter means "to say." So when you're saying something, you're
  making utterances. Saying "24" in math class is an utterance. A
  police officer yelling "Stop!" is an utterance. Saying "Good boy!"
  to your dog is an utterance. Even a long speech by the President is
  an utterance. If you can't hear it, it's not an utterance.

  So now let's consider how much information a hidden Markov model can
  convey to the second half of an utterance it produces from the first
  half.

* intrinsic :Quora:
  [2017-05-08 Mon 10:15]

  The intrinsic qualities of something have to do with its nature. An
  intrinsic quality of dogs is that they're loyal.

  Anything intrinsic comes from within. Doing a job for only money is
  not intrinsic. Doing a job because you love it is intrinsic; the
  motivation comes from within. It's good to treat people as having
  intrinsic value. If you like someone for intrinsic reasons, then you
  have no other motivation. The opposite of intrinsic is extrinsic,
  for things that come from the outside instead of from the inside.

  That is the dynamics and the production of observations from the
  underlying state both involve intrinsic noise.

  3. соперник (rival, contender, competitor, contestant, adversary, antagonist)
  4. неприятель (enemy, adversary)
  5. оппонент (opponent, adversary, enemy, opposer, contradictor)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. one's opponent in a contest, conflict, or dispute.
     "Davis beat his old adversary in the quarterfinals"


  An adversary is someone who fights against or opposes another. In
  tennis, you stand across the net from your adversary.

  Adversary as in "enemy" or "opponent" is related to the words
  adversarial, or hostile, or adverse, meaning against or contrary.
  The Adversary is a specific reference to Satan, or the Devil. The
  word adversary is from Middle English adversarie, from Latin
  adversarius, from adversus "against."

  If you're up against a much smarter adversary, you probably can't
  outwit them, so it might be a good idea just to behave randomly.

  1. перехитрить (outwit, outsmart, euchre, outmaneuver, circumvent, outfox)
  2. провести (outwit, catch, hoodwink, best, entrap)

  DEFINITION

  verb
  1. deceive or defeat by greater ingenuity.
     "Ray had outwitted many an opponent"


  Use the verb outwit to describe using your brain to beat an
  opponent, like outwitting someone by figuring out the answer to a
  difficult riddle.

  Wit comes from the Old English word witan, which means "to know." So
  someone who outwits another person knows more — or at least knows
  more than the person thought. You can outwit someone with clever
  words, or with craftiness on the playing field. An unexpected
  strategy can help one side outwit the other on the battlefield.

  If you're up against a much smarter adversary, you probably can't
  outwit them, so it might be a good idea just to behave randomly.

     "thousands of antiques hoarded by a compulsive collector"


  To hoard is to save something (or lots of things) for future use.
  Squirrels hoard nuts for the winter. Old ladies tend to hoard canned
  food and used plastic bags.

  People have been using the word hoard for both "to hide" and
  "treasure" for centuries; as both a verb and as a noun. Some hoard
  valuables, such as money, jewelry, and family antiques. Others build
  up a hoard, or cache, of things that aren't worth money but are
  important to them — like comic books or match books.

* plausibility :Quora:
  [2017-05-08 Mon 21:30]

  Something's plausibility is how likely it is to be true. You might,
  for example, question the plausibility of your brother's story about
  seeing a UFO land in the back yard.

  The noun plausibility means "likelihood" or "believability." You're
  most likely to come across the word in a negative or questioning
  context, as when someone doubts the plausibility of an action
  movie's plot or questions the plausibility of a debater's claims and
  arguments. If you aren't sure you believe something, you'll question
  its plausibility. The Latin root is plausibilis, "deserving applause
  or acceptable."

  1 cognitive plausibility in terms of a model of the brain; 2 a model
  that was learned from experiences rather than programmed by hand;
  and 3 representations that were continuous rather than Boolean, thus
  sidestepping some of the brittleness issues of traditional symbolic
  expert systems.

  7. чашка (cup, bowl, pan, basin, bob)
  8. мелкая бухта (basin)
  9. маленькая бухта (basin)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. a bowl for washing, typically attached to a wall and having faucets connected to a water supply; a washbasin.
     "‘I liked the traditional idea of washing with a basin and ewer,’ he reflects."
  2. a wide, round open container, especially one used for holding liquid.
     "People saw them turn over her basins of food and all the tofu products, eggs and all, splashed on the ground."
  3. a natural depression on the earth's surface, typically containing water.
     "the Indian Ocean basin"


  A basin is a container that holds water and is used for washing, but
  you probably just call it your bathroom sink.

  You can think of basinas something shaped like a bowl. If you're
  going for an old-fashioned ring, say "wash basin." If you’re in
  England, you might use a basin for cooking. The word basin also has
  various geological senses, particularly a depression in the ground
  or ocean floor. A basin is also the spot where a river drains — like
  the famed Mississippi River Basin. That’s one big bowl!

  So we're going a learn blue basin of attraction and a pink basin of

* bound                                                               :Quora:
  [2017-05-09 Tue 10:05]

  To bound is to jump or hop — usually as you run. Bound can also mean
  to go or to plan to go, especially to a certain destination, as in
  being bound for New York or homeward-bound.

  Superman can "leap tall buildings in a single bound," but the word
  bound is usually about boundaries. When you're playing soccer or
  football, the ball goes "out of bounds." Someone can also be bound
  with rope — tied up. Commitments are another kind of tie. When you
  get married, you're bound to your partner. If you make a promise,
  you're bound to your word. On a less pleasant note, if you're
  constipated, you're bound up.

  And so whenever your trying to use a recurrent neural network to
  learn attractors like this, you're bound to get vanishing or
  exploding gradients.

  verb
  1. уклоняться (dodge, skew, avoid, shrink, evade, deviate)
  2. увернуться (dodge, evade)
  3. избегать (avoid, shun, escape, evade, steer clear of, eschew)
  4. обходить (bypass, get round, skirt, evade, walk, sidestep)
  5. ускользать (escape, elude, slip, evade)
  6. увиливать (shirk, prevaricate, equivocate, dodge, evade, wriggle out of)
  7. отвиливать (evade, dodge)
  8. не поддаваться усилиям (evade)

  DEFINITION

  verb
  1. escape or avoid, especially by cleverness or trickery.
     "friends helped him to evade capture for a time"

  When you evade something, you escape it. You could evade a police
  chase by slipping into a secret alley, or you could evade your
  mother's questions about the missing cookies by slipping into
  another topic.

  Other things people like to evade? Death. Taxes. Creepy
  ex-boyfriends. The verb evade comes from Latin roots ex ("away) and
  vadere ("to walk"), meaning literally "to walk away or to escape."
  Definitely what you want to do with creepy ex-boyfriends.

  The third method really kind of evades the problem.

  акционер

  noun
  1. посредник (intermediary, mediator, agent, broker, middleman, stakeholder)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. (in gambling) an independent party with whom each of those who
     make a wager deposits the money or counters wagered.

     "The statute permits a gambling ‘loser’ or other permitted
     plaintiff to recover from ‘a winner, depositary or stakeholder ’
     money lost by a ‘wager, bet or stake.’"
     
  2. a person with an interest or concern in something, especially a
     business.

     "The body should also have regional networks in order to
     accommodate greater interests among stakeholders ."


  A stakeholder is a person interested in a company. If you become CEO
  of a big company, you'll have to keep the interests of every
  stakeholder in mind, from the employees to the customers to the
  investors, whenever you make decisions.

  Supposedly people used to gamble by putting their money on a wooden
  stake, and a person called a stakeholder who wasn't involved in the
  betting would supervise to make sure everything was fair. No one
  uses wooden stakes anymore, but we still call the person who holds
  the money and monitors the betting the stakeholder, and people often
  use stake to mean "risk," or "investment." That's why someone who is
  invested in a business is also called a stakeholder.

  Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide
  stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or
  service under test.[1] Software testing can also provide an
  objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to
  appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation.

   A [courtesy] is a polite remark or respectful act. Complain about a

   usually an apology from the manager and, if you're lucky, a free
   dinner.

   [Courtesy] is all about using your good manners, which is why it
   shares roots with the word courteous. Holding the door open for
   someone, writing a thank-you note for a gift, and letting the
   pregnant lady have the last seat on the bus are all courtesies that

  To hustle something means to hurriedly push it along. If you
  overslept, you'll have to hustle out of the house to get to work on
  time.

  Hustle comes from the Dutch word for "shake" or "toss." As a noun, a
  hustle is a busy, hurried scene, like the hustle of the subway at
  rush hour. We also call the act of swindling a hustle, because it
  happens so fast. As a verb, hustle can either mean to swindle
  someone or to hurry them, or to work hard. You can hustle someone
  out the door. If you hustle, you can earn good tips as a waiter.

  adjective
  1. having or showing yearning desire.
     "her [longing] eyes"
    
  noun
  1. a yearning desire.
     "Miranda felt a wistful [longing] for the old days"
    
  verb
  1. have a strong wish or desire.
     "she longed for a little more excitement"

   A [longing] is a strong feeling of need or desire for someone or
   something. If you're stuck in detention and all of your friends are
   outside enjoying a sunny day, you might be looking out the window
   with [longing].

   A [longing] describes an unfulfilled desire. The days might feel long
   as long as you are [longing] to see someone you love, if that person
   is far away. You might be [longing] for your mother's home-made
   chicken soup, if you are sick and far from home. Or perhaps you are
   a pregnant woman, wide awake and [longing] for pickles and ice-cream
   at four in the morning. Let's hope there's a twenty-four hour deli
   open somewhere to help satisfy your [longing].

   Anyway, it took us hours and hours, because the poor horse was
   tired, and I was sitting there trying to be polite, dying to scratch
   myself, and [longing] for a drink.

    If you do something languidly, you do it slowly, without haste, as
    if you're a Southern belle without a care in the world lazily
    sitting around on the veranda on a hot day.

    The adverb languidly comes from the Latin word languere, meaning "be
    weak or faint." When you do something such as run or climb stairs
    languidly, you probably do appear weak or sluggish. The word has a
    peaceful and relaxed connotation, however — if you do something
    languidly you aren't trying very hard and you aren't worrying much
    about it. You may chat languidly with your friends on a summer day
    while sipping tea on the patio.

   verb

      "he cuddles the baby close"

   To cuddle is to embrace in a loving, affectionate way. If you're
   having a terrible day, you probably wish you could just go home, get
   in bed, and cuddle with your cat.

   Cuddle might come from the Middle English couth, "known" — after
   all, you only cuddle with those you know. Or, cuddle may have
   started as baby talk that caught on. When you cuddle, you give a
   snuggly hug to make yourself or another person feel loved or
   comforted. As a noun, cuddle describes the time of the embrace, like
   having one last cuddle before leaving for a long trip.

   noun
   1. a large group of animals, especially hoofed mammals, that live, feed, or migrate together or are kept together as livestock.
      "a [herd] of elephants"

   verb
   1. (with reference to a group of people or animals) move in a particular direction.
      "Nick [herd]ed me through the baggage claim and into his Jaguar"
   2. keep or look after (livestock).
      "Hunter and Tripp [herd]ed sheep"

   A [herd] is a bunch of animals — or people who act like a bunch of
   animals. It's also a verb — when people [herd] animals, they try to
   keep them moving in the same direction.

   A [herd] usually refers to a group of animals with hooves, like cows
   or sheep (meat-eating animals like wolves cruise around in packs).
   On a farm, sheepdogs are in charge of [herd]ing the [herd] of sheep.
   [Herd]s of buffalo roam the plains. It's rarely a good thing when
   people act like a [herd], which is to do what everyone else is doing.
   You might want "to break away from the [herd]" if everyone is wearing
   pinwheel hats, for example. If you're having trouble getting people
   together, you might say it's like "[herd]ing cats." Cats never follow
   directions.

   adjective
   1. knobbly, rough, and twisted, especially with age.
      "the [gnarled] old oak tree"

   You’ve probably heard the word "gnarly" used to describe
   something really awesome. But [gnarled] means rugged, roughened and
   knotty, like the hands of an old wood carver, as well as the wood
   he carves.

   We owe the adjective [gnarled] and other forms of the word to our
   friend Shakespeare, who created it in 1603. In “Measure for
   Measure,” he writes, “Thy sharpe and sulpherous bolt splits the
   un-wedgable and [gnarled] oak.” But [gnarled] didn't come into use
   again until the 19th century. In any case, word experts believe
   it's related to the Middle English word knar which means “knot in
   wood.”

   1. the quality of being kind and generous.
      "I was overwhelmed by the [generosity] of friends and neighbors"


   [Generosity] is a quality that's a lot like unselfishness. Someone
   showing [generosity] is happy to give time, money, food, or kindness
   to people in need.

   [Generosity] is a quality — like honesty and patience — that we all
   probably wish we had more of. When you show [generosity], you might
   give away things or money or put others before yourself. But
   [generosity] is about more than cash and stuff. When you're forgiving

    The root of the word plaintively is the French word plainte, meaning
    “lamentation.” It’s also the origin of the word plaintiff, meaning a
    person who brings a lawsuit against someone else. The person has a

   verb
   1. irritate intensely; infuriate.
      "this futile process exasperates prison officials"


   It’s understandable if you get [exasperated], or really frustrated, if
   you’re standing in the supermarket's express lane and everyone in
   front of you has way more than the 10-item maximum.

   Over the centuries, nothing much has happened to the definition of
   this word — the Latin original means "irritated to anger." Speaking
   of which, let's get back to the supermarket, a veritable hotbed of
   [exasperated] people pushing wobbly-wheeled shopping carts their
   children try to fill with cartoon-branded junk food, brushing past
   unstable store displays that come tumbling down, enduring
   inoffensive but flavorless supermarket music, and emerging into the
   cold light of day unable to remember where they parked the car.

   Larry gave a short, [exasperated] sigh and picked up his book again.

   adjective
   1. deeply upset and agitated.
      "a [distraught] woman sobbed and screamed for help"


   If you are upset, you are [distraught]. If you don't want to explain
   why you are pulling your hair out, just utter "Leave me alone; I'm
   [distraught]." It'll work.

   While [distraught] may sound like an old Germanic past participle, it
   is actually an alteration of distract from the Latin distrahere "to
   draw in different directions." If you are [distraught], you are so
   upset that it's hard to think straight, hence your mind is "drawn in
   different directions."

   said Mother, [distraught].

   noun
   1. a person living in solitude as a religious discipline.
      "Secular idleness would have little meaning in solitude, and the
      religious contemplation of the [hermit] or monk is not in question
      here."
   2. a hummingbird found in the shady lower layers of tropical forests, foraging along a regular route.
      "A local guide took us out the first morning for a half-day of
      birding, including a visit to a lek of performing green [hermit]
      hummingbirds, and then got us on our way to the Canopy Tower, a
      short distance north of the city."


   You hear about [hermit]s more often than you meet one, and that’s
   because a [hermit] is someone who likes to be alone, far from people,
   sometimes because of their religious beliefs or maybe because they
   simply want some privacy.

   [Hermit]s like living solo, alone in the woods, up in a mountain, or
   sometimes they live in a city without hardly ever leaving their
   apartment. The root of the word is the Greek erēmos, meaning
   “solitary.” A life of solitude isn’t for everyone, but a [hermit]
   chooses it for any number of reasons. For example, being able to
   honor their religious beliefs more fully or hating all of humanity
   are two possible motivations to become a [hermit].

   'I don't think it's good for us to live like [hermit]s,' said Larry.

   adjective
   1. (of a statement or course of action) chosen in accordance with wisdom or prudence; likely to be of benefit.
      "I cannot believe that it is [sensible] to spend so much"
   2. readily perceived; appreciable.
      "it will effect a [sensible] reduction in these figures"


   [Sensible] means practical and reasonable. If you're wearing [sensible]
   shoes, they're sturdy, comfortable, good for walking, and your feet
   don't hurt. If you're a [sensible] person, you're level-headed and
   calm, and you make wise decisions.

   [Sensible] may not sound exciting — who wants to be like a pair of
   galoshes, when you can be stilettos? But [sensible] is the voice of
   reason, and when you're tooling along in your convertible, you'll be
   grateful for the [sensible] 15-mile-per-hour speed limit posted at
   that sharp turn where the road drops off into the canyon. [Sensible]
   comes from the Latin sensibilis, meaning "perceptible by the
   senses," a meaning that eventually evolved into "having good sense,
   reasonable."

   'If you made [sensible] suggestions I wouldn't disagree.'

   adjective
   1. so foolish, unreasonable, or out of place as to be amusing; ridiculous.
      "it's [ludicrous] that I have been fined"


   [Ludicrous] things are funny, absurd, or nonsensical. If someone says
   something silly or far-fetched, you could say "That's [ludicrous]!"

   [Ludicrous] originally meant something that was funny, playful, or
   joking: a [ludicrous] comment was just a really funny comment. Over
   time, [ludicrous] took on a more negative flavor. Now a [ludicrous]
   statement might be funny, but it's also ridiculous, hard to believe,
   off the wall, or even stupid. When people say "That idea is
   [ludicrous]!" it usually means the idea could never happen: the notion
   is laughable. Saying Neil Armstrong was the third President would be
   a [ludicrous] statement.

   'I don't see anything [ludicrous] in anything I suggested.'

   [Unkempt] literally means “not combed,” but use it to describe

   when you roll out of bed in the morning. Keep it that way if you're
   going for the rock star look.

   From the fusing of un- “not” with kempt “neat” comes the adjective
   [unkempt]. Kempt has fallen out of use, but [unkempt] persists as a
   popular word to describe anything unpolished, rough, or disorderly.
   Pig sties, the corrals where pigs live, are usually quite [unkempt].
   That's why your mom keeps calling your messy, [unkempt] train wreck of

   1. a piece of land planted with fruit trees.
      "Apple and pear [orchard]s were planted, as were plum thickets

   An [orchard] is a tree garden. If you visit New England in autumn,
   make sure to stop by a local apple [orchard] and pick a few baskets to
   take home.

   From the Old English orceard blossomed our modern-day spelling of
   [orchard], a noun meaning “fruit farm.” But you can also use the word
   figuratively to refer to something filled with treats or precious
   content. The US Congregational minister, Henry Ward Beecher, was
   famous for having proclaimed, “A book is a garden, an [orchard], a
   storehouse, a party, a company by the way, a counselor, a multitude
   of counselors.”

   It stood on a hill overlooking the sea, surrounded by unkempt
   olive-groves and silent [orchard]s of lemonand orange-trees.

   1. an illness, typically a minor one.
      "Along the way, minor [ailment]s were treated and hypochondria
      dispelled, with adept matter of factness."


   If you've got a rash or a persistent cough, you can call that an
   [ailment]. Some other common [ailment]s are allergies or chronic
   headaches. They can be a real pain. Literally.

   The word [ailment] comes from the Old English eglan meaning "to
   trouble, plague, afflict," and the suffix -ment from the Latin
   mentum, which when added to the end of word describing an action
   turns that word into the result of that action. So the result of
   something that troubles, plagues or afflicts you is an [ailment] — a
   pain or discomfort that just doesn't seem to go away.

   The word [ghoul] originates in the Arabic word “ghul,” which refers to
   an evil spirit that digs up graves and eats the dead. Some confuse
   [ghoul] with the word “gremlin,” but the two are not interchangeable. A
   gremlin does not gorge on the flesh of the dead; it is more a
   mischievous imp and troublemaker, famous for causing mechanical
   difficulties in World War II aircraft.

   noun
   1. the action of jostling.
      "The resulting [jostle] of competing versions marks him more than any other poet, even Auden."

   verb
   1. push, elbow, or bump against (someone) roughly, typically in a crowd.
      "passengers arriving and departing, jostling one another"


   The verb [jostle] describes being bumped and pushed in a horde of people
   — or doing the bumping, like those at a concert who [jostle] their way
   to the front, and the people [jostle]d out of their spots when the
   newcomers arrive.

   [Jostle] describes both what someone does, like an impatient person who
   [jostle]s other people out of his way on a crowded bus or subway car,
   and what happens to those victims: They may have their bags and cups
   of hot coffee [jostle]d out of their hands by the impatient one's
   pushing and shoving. When you say the word [jostle] remember to shove
   the t out of the way because it's silent: "JOSS-ul."

   We were [jostle]d and pushed as we struggled to get back to the place
   where we had left the car.

   1. a person who is unable to walk or move properly because of disability or injury to their back or legs.

   verb
   1. cause (someone) to become unable to move or walk properly.
      "a crippling disease"


   When something is [cripple]d, it's not working properly. Your bike might
   be [cripple]d by the broken front brake that won't let the wheel turn
   freely.

   You can used the adjective [cripple]d to talk about a broken machine or
   a process that's not working the way it should. It was once commonly
   used to describe a physically disabled person, but this has become an
   offensive term and should be avoided. The word [cripple]d comes from the
   Old English crypel, which is related to cryppan, "to crook or to
   bend."

   1. a piece of wood, metal, or some other material having one thick end and tapering to a thin edge, that is driven between two objects or parts of an object to secure or separate them.

   A [wedge] is a block of wood that keeps a door propped open, or a
   problem that pulls people apart, like the jealousy that drove a [wedge]
   between two friends.

   [Wedge] means "triangle-shaped." Pieces of pie are [wedge]s. So are
   tortilla chips. In some parts of the country, a sandwich on a long
   roll is called a [wedge], or a wedgie, while in other places, it's a
   hoagie or sub. Just about everywhere, the [wedge] you get in the
   schoolyard means your underwear are pulled up between your butt
   cheeks, which is consistent with the verb form of [wedge]: to squeeze
   into a tight space.

   This dark multi-coloured [wedge] of humanity moved slowly towards the
   dark door of the church, and we were swept along with it, [wedge]d
   like pebbles in a larva-flow.

   I only managed to stay on because my feet had become [wedge]d in the

   — both of those objects are probably [embroider]ed.

   To [embroider] refers to a type of ornamentation or needlework, but
   another usage of the word [embroider] means to embellish the truth. For
   example, if a fisherman sitting on the dock tells you about the 38
   inch striped bass he almost caught this morning, he may have found a
   way to [embroider] the truth.

   The coffin was standing upright, looking like a silver chrysalis,
   and at its lower end a portion had been removed so that the saint's
   feet, clad in the richly-[embroider]ed slippers, peeped out.

   1. a brilliant red color.

   Use the adjective [scarlet] to describe things that are a deep, rich
   red color, like a robin's breast or a wild strawberry.

   Some things are such a vivid shade that red doesn't seem to be quite
   accurate — [scarlet] is the perfect word to use for them. Blood is
   [scarlet], and so are rubies and ripe cherries and some brilliant red
   roses. You can also use [scarlet] as a noun, to talk about the color
   itself: "My favorite painter uses a lot of [scarlet]." In the mid-13th
   century, [scarlet] simply meant "rich cloth," which might have been
   the color [scarlet] or some other color entirely.

   I think they came to the conclusion that Mother was about to have a
   fit, and with some justification, for she was [scarlet] in the face,
   and her grimaces were getting wilder and wilder.

   The Latin root, incantare, means "cast a spell on."If you're so
   captivated by something, like stunning photographs in an art
   gallery, that you may as well be under a fairy tale spell, you're
   [enchant]ed. Charming actors in old movies often say, "[Enchant]ed,"
   after being introduced to a beautiful woman. What they mean,
   essentially, is that they find her so fascinating they can't take
   their eyes off her.

   verb
   1. adopt a position where the knees are bent and the upper body is brought forward and down, sometimes to avoid detection or to defend oneself.

   To [crouch] is to bend your knees, pull your body in, and sit on your
   heels. This position is called a [crouch]. You might [crouch] down to

      "Fido tended to slobber"

   To slobber is to allow spit, or saliva, to drip from your mouth.

   Another word for slobber is drool. You can use it as a verb, as in
   "That cupcake made me slobber," or a noun: "Wipe that slobber off
   your chin." To figuratively slobber over something or someone is to
   be overly enthusiastic or sentimental, like when your friends all
   slobber over your adorable new puppy.

   'After all those people have been [slobbering] over those slippers you
   have to go and kiss them.'

   When you [rinse] something, you run water over it. You probably at

   so your [enduring] friendship or your [enduring] interest in sports is
   solid enough to stand the test of time. Besides meaning
   long-lasting, [enduring] sometimes means long-suffering as when
   someone has an [enduring] disposition, but this meaning is found in

      "black ravens emerged from the fog"

   Things that are [emerging] are just being born — or they're reaching
   an adult state. The important thing is they're growing and
   developing.

   You could say an improved baseball team is an [emerging] force in the
   National League, or a new disease is an [emerging] threat. [Emerging]
   things can be brand new but aren't necessarily: they could just be
   beginning to develop. [Emerging] means something close to sprouting —
   when you think of this word, think "growing."

   1. a mark, fault, or other imperfection that mars a substance or object.
      "plates with [flaw]s in them were sold at the outlet store"
   2. a squall of wind; a short storm.
      "High cirrus clouds form white streaks across its surface and a
      number of dark storms act as [flaw]s and focus for the eye."

   verb
   1. (of an imperfection) mar, weaken, or invalidate (something).
      "the computer game was [flaw]ed by poor programming"

   A [flaw] can be a sign of weakness or defect. If you try to make wings
   and fly off the roof but wind up crashing in the gutter, there's a
   [flaw] in your plan.

   In the early 14th century, when the noun [flaw] was first recorded, it
   referred to a snowflake or spark of fire. That sense is now
   obsolete, and now we use [flaw] to describe shortcomings in either
   character or object. We all have [flaw]s. It can also describe an
   intentional mark of imperfection. “You see,” said the dancer Martha
   Graham, “when weaving a blanket, an Indian woman leaves a [flaw] in
   the weaving of that blanket to let the soul out.”

   But his great qualities and personal [flaw]s remained inextricably
   linked.

      "the case has no direct bearing on the issues"
   3. the level to which something bad can be tolerated.
      "school was bad enough, but now it's past bearing"
   4. a part of a machine that bears friction, especially between a rotating part and its housing.
      "If the [bearings] that allow the crankshaft to turn freely are
      worn out, the crankshaft cannot turn so the engine cannot run."
   5. a structural part that supports weight, such as a wall that supports a beam.
      "It's as if the closet has had every foundation and bearing wall
      removed but still stands, supported by mere expediency, etiquette
      and the lingering shards of shame."
   6. the direction or position of something, or the direction of movement, relative to a fixed point. It is typically measured in degrees, usually with magnetic north as zero.
      "the Point is on a bearing of 015°"
   7. a device or charge.
      "armorial [bearings]"

   When you walk into a room with your shoulders straight and your head
   up, people might say you have a noble bearing. Bearing is the way
   you hold your body, and it often means you hold it well.

   Bearing has many uses, but they mostly involve support and/or
   direction. Bearing, for example, is the name given to a mechanical
   part that supports a moving joint — like a ball bearing. In
   buildings, [bearings] are walls or beams that support the building. In
   the same way, when you carry your body, you are bearing yourself up.
   Bearing also is used to talk about direction and travel: you could
   step off the sidewalk and nearly be run over by a car bearing north.

   Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write
   down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning

   find the way certain celebrities talk to be quite imitable. But add
   the prefix in-, meaning “not,” and you get “not imitated.” Use this

   were first made. Many [reed] instruments, including the clarinet,

   adjective

      "a [versatile] sewing machine"
   2. changeable; inconstant.

   To describe a person or thing that can adapt to do many things or

   In E.B. White's classic children's book Charlotte's Web, Charlotte
   the spider tells Wilbur the pig that she is [versatile]. "What does
   '[versatile]' mean — full of eggs?" Wilbur asks. "Certainly not,"
   Charlotte replies. "'[Versatile]' means I can turn with ease from one
   thing to another." Charlotte knew her etymology, because the word
   reflects its Latin root, versatilis, "turning around; revolving." It

   1. the dialect of Greek used by the ancient Athenians, the chief literary form of classical Greek.

   An [attic] is an unfinished room at the very top of a house, just
   below the roof. It’s often the setting for creepy stories because
   it’s a room people don’t go in very often.

   A finished [attic] is extra space you can use for a playroom, bedroom,
   or storage area. In fiction, it’s a great place to stash crazy
   people. In Charlotte Bronte’s book Jane Eyre, there’s a madwoman in
   the [attic]. Some [attic]s don't even have floors that can be walked on,
   though — they're just empty space at the top of a house. An [attic]
   was originally called an [attic] storey, from the architectural term
   [Attic] order.

   Larry took possession of one enormous [attic] and engaged two
   carpenters to make bookshelves; Leslie converted the large covered
   veranda behind the house into a shooting-gallery, and hung an
   enormous red flag up outside whenever he was practising; Mother
   pottered absent-mindedly round the vast, subterranean, stone-flagged
   kitchen, preparing gallons of beef-tea and trying to listen to
   Lugaretzia's monologues and worry about Margo at the same time.

   [Emerald] is a green gemstone. It's also the name of this particular
   shade of green. On St. Patrick's Day, you'll see the color [emerald]
   everywhere — in cupcake icing and maybe even in your beer.

   Green things are called [emerald] because of the [emerald] itself, which
   is a green, transparent form of beryl and a precious gemstone.
   Gemstones are found in many forms of jewelry, and they're especially
   loved in Ireland, which is also known as the [Emerald] Isle. Like many
   gemstone names, [emerald] has a long pedigree in many languages: most
   immediately French, Latin, and Greek.

   In the crumbling walls of the sunken garden lived dozens of little
   black scorpions, shining and polished as if they had been made out
   of bakelite; in the figand lemon-trees just below the garden were
   quantities of [emerald]-green tree-frogs, like delicious satiny sweets
   among the leaves; up on the hillside lived snakes of various sorts,
   brilliant lizards and tortoises.

   From the literal ladder definition of [rung], a place to put your foot
   (or hand) as you climb up, comes the metaphorical meaning of "a
   level." For example, if you get a promotion at work, you might say
   you're climbing up the [rung]s of the company. The horizontal bars
   between the legs of a chair are also [rung]s. This word comes from a
   Germanic root meaning "stake, staff, or bar."

   of which, let's get back to the supermarket, a veritable hotbed of

   unstable store displays that come tumbling down, enduring

   [Futile] comes from the Latin futilis, which originally meant "leaky."
   Although we use [futile] to talk about more than buckets, the image of
   a leaky vessel is a good illustration of the adjective. Pouring
   water into a leaky bucket is [futile]. Your exercise program will be
   [futile] if you don't stop chowing down on chocolate. [Futile] is
   fancier than its synonym useless. Other synonyms are fruitless or
   vain. The i can be either short (FYOO-t'l) or long (FYOO-tile).

   [Brood] is also what a chicken does when she sits on her eggs to hatch

   Synonyms for [valiant] include "heroic" and "courageous," so it isn’t
   surprising that those who serve in the military often are called
   [valiant]. The 14th-century French origins of the word are "bold" or
   "of worth," which makes the adjective [valiant] a good one for
   describing ordinary people who put all they have into something,
   making their efforts [valiant], even if they fail. The Plymouth
   [Valiant], by the way, was considered a strong and successful car,
   though [valiant] usually refers to people.

   adjective
   1. active, fast, and energetic.
      "a good [brisk] walk"

   [Brisk] is one of those delightful words that sounds like what it
   means: quick, lively, bracing, and refreshing. There's nothing like
   a [brisk] walk in the morning to get the blood flowing and the spirit
   ready for the day.

   Anything [brisk] is happening quickly but not too fast. Probably taken
   from the French brusque, which also means "quick," but in a more
   negative way, [brisk] can be used to describe not only physical
   actions but also more conceptual notions, such as [brisk] business
   around the holidays or [brisk] interactions at a speed-dating event.
   The soft-drink called [Brisk] must be called that for a good reason.
   Perhaps it picks you up!

   The females, once the young were hatched, behaved in much the same
   way as they had always done: they flew a little faster, there was an
   air of [brisk] efficiency about them, but that was all.

   hoop. There's also the [rim] of a wheel — the part the tire is

   English [rim]a, "edge," which appears in the Old English word sæ[rim]a,
   "seashore," or "[rim] of the sea."

   This noun is from Latin decōrus "proper, becoming, handsome," from
   décor "beauty, grace," which is also the source of English décor.
   The corresponding adjective is decorous, meaning "well-behaved in a
   particular situation." Both [decorum] and decorous are often used to
   describe behavior in a classroom or courtroom.

   noun
   1. the outer parts of a town or city.
      "the park was built on the [outskirts] of New York in 1857"

   Some people like to live downtown. Others prefer the open spaces of
   the suburbs. But if you live in between the two, you are in the
   [outskirts], the place where the city ends and the suburbs begin.

   [Outskirts] describes the outer edge of a city or town, farthest from
   the center but still technically part of that place. If you had a
   city map, you could draw a line on all sides where crowded streets
   filled with apartment building and businesses begin to give way to
   single-family houses and country roads. You might not get a perfect
   circle but you will see that [outskirts] are those border places
   between the city and the little towns that surround it.

   Well, everything went very well, and the horse behaved with great
   decorum, until we got into the [outskirts] of the town.

   [Inextricably] is an adverb that means in a manner that is impossible
   to unravel or separate from something else. It usually modifies
   words like "linked" and "tied." To most Americans, pilgrims and
   Thanksgiving are [inextricably] linked.

   [Inextricably] is the adverb form of the adjective inextricable, which
   comes from the Latin word inextricabilis, meaning cannot be
   disentangled. In your mind, summer and the beach are [inextricably]
   tied together because you've spent your vacation at the shore for as
   long as you can remember. Circumstances might [inextricably] link you
   and your neighbor when you're trapped in an elevator together for
   the longest nine hours of your life.

   But his great qualities and personal flaws remained [inextricably]
   linked.
