* tangible :misc:
[2021-04-05 Mon 11:10]

When you can touch something, it's tangible: "I need tangible proof
that aliens exist — I want to shake their little green hands!"

Tangible is from Latin tangere, "to touch," and it simply means
something that can be touched or felt, though it can be used in
metaphorical senses: tangible assets have a value that can be
precisely measured, and tangible grief can be clearly sensed by an
onlooker. So you might not need to physically touch something for it
to be tangible, but it has to be grounded in the real world of facts:
"Has the teen pop star demonstrated any tangible ability to sing?"

Our standard of living increased 20-fold in these 170 years, but
barely a day went by that lacked tangible reasons for pessimism.
* invincible :misc:
[2021-04-05 Mon 11:11]

Something invincible is victorious over everything. Disease, death,
destruction? No match for something truly invincible. Mere humans who
imagine they're invincible, however, will inevitably prove that
they're not.

Invincible comes ultimately from the Latin verb vincere, "to conquer."
Many of the uses for invincible are for describing someone or
something victorious or unbeatable at what they do. A company can be
invincible when it outsells similar businesses for years, a tennis
player is invincible after winning all of the majors in a year or a
career, and Superman and the Indomitable Snowman are invincible as
long as they stay away from kryptonite and the warm sun.

He associated good times with the end of bad times. Getting wealthy
made him feel like staying wealthy was inevitable, and that he was
invincible. After losing nearly everything he reflected:

* belabor :misc:
[2021-04-05 Mon 11:13]

Belabor means to go at something with everything you've got. When you
say, "Don't belabor or agonize over the decision," it means, "Move
on."

Belabor is made up of the Latin roots be and labor meaning "to exert
one's strength upon." You can belabor a point by using excessive
detail, or you could belabor the obvious by stating over and over what
everyone already knows. Belaboring can be a physical attack as well. A
person can belabor or beat the living daylights out of you with a
club.

“I’ve been banging away at this thing for 30 years. I think the simple
math is, some projects work and some don’t. There’s no reason to
belabor either one. Just get on to the next.”
* bargain :misc:
[2021-04-05 Mon 11:15]

The table you bought at a yard sale for five dollars might seem like a
bargain until you get it home and realize it only has three legs. A
bargain is a good deal.

Inexpensive items are one type of bargain, and another kind of bargain
is an agreement you make with someone — a deal or compromise. Two
countries might strike a trade bargain, or you could make a bargain
with your friend that you'll drive to the mall if she buys you a giant
cinnamon roll. Bargain also means to negotiate the details of a
purchase, which makes sense because the root word is bargaignier,
French for "haggle over the price."

It was such a bargain that the Germans effectively considered it a
donation.
* preemptively :misc:
[2021-04-05 Mon 11:18]

A preemptive action is made to keep some other action from being
taken.  Before you could be accused of eating the whole cake, you
decided to make a preemptive apology, which was met with awkward
silence.

Tired of being disturbed by your roommate's loud music, your
preemptive strike was to crank up your favorite opera as soon as you
arrived home.  Unfortunately, he'd already made a preemptive strike of
his own by borrowing your stereo.  Don't confuse preemptive with
peremptory, a word meaning “arrogant.” You don't have to be arrogant
to make a preemptive move, just cautious.

That is by design. No comedic genius is smart enough to preemptively
know what jokes will land well. Every big comedian tests their
material in small clubs before using it in big venues.

[2021-04-05 Mon 11:21]

Your thumb is the fifth digit on your hand, the one that doesn't quite
match your fingers. Thumbs help us grip objects with care and
precision — it would be difficult to hold chopsticks without a thumb.

Humans are more dextrous than our closest primate relatives because of
our nimble thumbs. They're opposable, so we can move them forward and
touch them to our fingers. Some monkeys share this trait, and they're
the best able to use primitive tools. Your thumbs make it possible for
you to brush your teeth, write with a pen, and snap. You can also
thumb through the pages of a book — in other words, turn each page
with your thumb.

To incur is to get or receive — and usually it's something you brought
upon yourself. If you don't pay your credit card bills on time, you'll
likely incur lots of fees and some serious debt.

Generally, when you incur something, that something is
undesirable. You can incur penalties, expenses, a parking ticket, or a
friend’s wrath, for example. But it's pretty unlikely that you'd incur
free tickets to the World Series. Frederick Douglass once famously
said, “I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring
the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and to incur my own
abhorrence."

Part of why this isn’t intuitive is because in most fields we only see
the finished product, not the losses incurred that led to the
tail-success product.
* horrendous :misc:
[2021-04-05 Mon 12:02]

Bad luck, an injury, a mistake, an unfortunate outfit, or a crime —
anything can be called horrendous if it causes such dread or fear that
you can barely even think about it.

If you’ve ever encountered something horrendous, you won’t be
surprised to learn that the word traces back to the Latin word
horrere, meaning "to bristle with fear, shudder." That’s a good way to
think about horrendous things — they cause you to shudder. You can use
the word to describe any type of thing — people, ideas, actions, and
so on — but save it for those things that are not merely bad but
instead are truly horrifying.

Something I’ve learned from both investors and entrepreneurs is that
no one makes good decisions all the time. The most impressive people
are packed full of horrendous ideas that are often acted upon.
* quip :misc:
[2021-04-05 Mon 12:02]

A quip — a short, witty comment — can be pleasant, wise, or sarcastic,
but usually carries an element of humor.

A quip is a witty or clever remark that sounds spur-of-the-moment. A
successful quip must sound offhand, as though it were an afterthought,
even if the speaker has been honing the statement for days.  Dorothy
Parker was a famous writer known for her quick quips, such as, "The
best way to keep children home is to make the home atmosphere pleasant
— and let the air out of the tires."

There is the old pilot quip that their jobs are “hours and hours of
boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.”

[2021-04-05 Mon 12:02]

Genius is an exceptional talent or skill, something above and beyond
the norm. A genius is someone who possesses this brilliance, like a
child prodigy who learned the piano at age 3 and played sold-out
concerts by age 5.

Genius comes from the Latin word of the same name, meaning "guardian
deity or spirit which watches over each person from birth" or "innate
ability."  Your genius — your superior talent — at the game of chess
could make you a world champion. Your amazing genius would also make
you a genius. The word can be used more lightheartedly to describe a
natural ability or flair for something. You may have a genius for
putting together stylish outfits.

Napoleon’s definition of a military genius was, “The man who can do
the average thing when all those around him are going crazy.”

[2021-04-05 Mon 12:04]

Your duds are your clothes. Your grandmother might hand you a hundred
dollar bill at the mall and say, "Go buy yourself some new duds."

The noun duds is an informal, slang term for "clothing." You can pack
your duds in a suitcase before a vacation or arrange your duds by
color in your closet. Though experts aren't sure where the word duds
came from originally, they know that it was dudde in the 1300s, which
meant "cloak or mantle," and later came to be duddes and to mean
"ragged clothing."

Most public companies are duds, a few do well, and a handful become
extraordinary winners that account for the majority of the stock
market’s returns.

Perhaps 99% of the works someone like Berggruen acquired in his life
turned out to be of little value. But that doesn’t particularly matter
if the other 1% turn out to be the work of someone like
Picasso. Berggruen could be wrong most of the time and still end up
stupendously right.

* exclusive :misc:
[2021-04-05 Mon 12:05]

Exclusive means with limited access. The only way you might get
reservations at one of the most exclusive restaurants in Los Angeles
is to become friends with the maitre d', or become famous.

By its nature, something that is exclusive leaves people out, or
excludes them. You would think this was a bad thing, since excluding
people is not very nice, but by being exclusive, things like clubs,
restaurants, and resorts become all the more desirable. Exclusive can
also mean sole or only: The company became the exclusive soda vendor
at the new stadium. The local newspaper got an exclusive interview and
broke the news.

You can be optimistic that the long-term growth trajectory is up and
to the right, but equally sure that the road between now and then is
filled with landmines, and always will be. Those two things are not
mutually exclusive.

[2021-04-05 Mon 12:06]

To let out a chuckle or giggle is to laugh: people laugh when
something is funny.

To chortle, cackle, guffaw, or titter is to laugh. The job of a
comedian is to make people laugh. Often people laugh at things that
aren't supposed to be funny, and people also laugh to be polite. If
something is silly, you can say "That's a laugh!" If you had fun at a
party, you can say "Thanks for the laughs." Everybody's laugh sounds a
little different. It would be a shame if your laugh sounded like Elmer
Fudd.

What’s the saying? You plan, God laughs. Financial and investment planning
are critical, because they let you know whether your current actions are
within the realm of reasonable.
* gnaw :misc:
[2021-04-05 Mon 12:06]

To gnaw is to bite or chew. Your favorite food might be corn on the
cob, because you love to gnaw along each row of kernels.

To gnaw also means to deteriorate or wear away as if by gnawing with
the teeth. In Arches National Park, the weather has gnawed away at the
rocks creating beautiful formations like arches, bridges, and balanced
rocks. In this sense, to gnaw can be used even more
figuratively. Something might gnaw at the back of your mind —
something you were supposed to do, although now you can't quite
remember what it was.

No one wants to hold cash during a bull market. They want to own
assets that go up a lot. You look and feel conservative holding cash
during a bull market, because you become acutely aware of how much
return you’re giving up by not owning the good stuff. Say cash earns
1% and stocks return 10% a year. That 9% gap will gnaw at you every
day.
* complacent :misc:
[2021-04-05 Mon 12:06]

Someone who is complacent has become overly content — the
junk-food-eating couch potato might be feeling complacent about his
health.

The literal meaning of this word's Latin root is "very pleased," but
even though complacent people may seem pleased with themselves, we are
rarely pleased with them. They are unconcerned by things that should
concern them, and they may neglect their duties. A complacent person
might be heard saying, "Ehh, don't worry about it!" — when there
really is something to worry about.

Moritz: There’s a lot of truth to that … We assume that tomorrow won’t
be like yesterday. We can’t afford to rest on our laurels. We can’t be
complacent. We can’t assume that yesterday’s success translates into
tomorrow’s good fortune.

strategies, and successful investing attempts.

* clamor :misc:
[2021-04-05 Mon 21:16]

To clamor is to make a demand — LOUDLY. It's usually a group that
clamors — like Americans might clamor for comprehensive health care
coverage.

The noun clamor is often used specifically to describe a noisy outcry
from a group of people, but more generally, the word means any loud,
harsh sound. You could describe the clamor of sirens in the night or
the clamor of the approaching subway in the tunnel.

This is, in part, because other tasks and projects clamor for our
attention, but also because it’s just really hard to look long and
intently at our selfish motives, at what we’ve called “the elephant in
the brain.”

If it’s all the rage, everybody’s into it, your parents don’t get it,
and teenage girls across the globe are trying to outdo each other with
it, it’s officially a fad.

From hairstyles to hula hoops to saying “that’s hot,” fads are known
to rise to crazed levels of popularity seemingly overnight. But they
fade out just as fast, leaving late adopters with outdated sayings and
some seriously uncool shoes. Much like a fad itself, no one has any
real idea where this word came from. But it’s still in fashion some
144 years later.

But all I found was an avalanche of management fads and techniques,
cod philosophy, self-help manuals, life coaches and gurus, all of
varying degrees of dubiousness, and all insisting that they definitely
knew the secret to happiness, no matter who you are.
* credible :misc:
[2021-04-06 Tue 16:42]

Someone who's credible is honest and believable. A pathological liar,
for example, might not be the most credible witness for your case
against the bank robber.

Similar to words like reliable and plausible, credible is an adjective
that comes to us from the Latin credibilis, meaning “worthy to be
believed.” A credible reputation is often earned through consistent
good behavior and an overall trustworthy personality. Spill a secret
you promised to keep, or lie under oath in a courtroom, and you lose
all credibility.

If you’re an experienced neurobod, you can easily spot when someone is
just borrowing the terminology of your field to sound credible, rather
than actually having any useful understanding of it.

A smattering is a small but inexact amount of something. If you know a
smattering of things about Australia, then you don't know much.

A smattering is a small amount of something, but it's hard to say how
much. It's probably less than a bunch, but it's not much more than a
whit or a jot. If you said "There's a smattering of squirrels in the
park," then there are only a few squirrels. This word also implies
that you don't understand a subject very well — a smattering of
knowledge is only a tiny bit of knowledge.

To truly explain how the brain deals with happiness would take more
than a vague two-line summary or a smattering of impressive-sounding
terminology, it would take a whole book …

A grievance is a complaint.  It can be formal, as when an employee
files a grievance because of unsafe working conditions, or more of an
emotional matter, like a grievance against an old friend who betrayed
you.

A grievance is a complaint that may or may not be justified. Often a
grievance is a complaint about something that breaks a rule or a law,
like a grievance filed against a person who builds a fence in his
front yard in a town that does not allow that. If that same neighbor
plants flowers he knows make you sneeze uncontrollably, you might be
unhappy about that, but this is the kind of grievance you can work out
among yourselves.

Because if there’s one thing I do, it’s go to ridiculous extremes to
settle minor grievances, even if the party that caused them remains
blissfully unaware of my existence.

That dank, stone-walled underground prison where wretched prisoners
were kept manacled in medieval days? That was a dungeon, otherwise
known as the "keep," and most familiar to us today from a million
video games and movies.

In fact, the original meaning of dungeon was of something overground
rather than underground, coming from the Old French term donjon,
meaning the "great tower of a castle," and the underground meaning
only came later. Rapunzel in the fairy tale was held captive in a
tower rather than an underground cell and if she hadn't been, her long
hair wouldn't have been much help in her escape.

So, I wanted to include insights from a wide range of people from
different walks of life, to see what makes them happy (or not). As a
result, I ended up talking with stars of stage and screen,
millionaires, leading scientists, journalists, ghost-hunters and one
person who … well, let’s just say that in no other research I’ve done
did I ever hear the term ‘sex dungeon’ used so freely and so often.
* warn :misc:
[2021-04-06 Tue 16:48]

When you warn someone, you advise them to be careful or tell them
about a problem or danger. If you perform a dangerous stunt, you
should probably warn your audience, "Don't try this at home."

Many traffic signs are meant to warn drivers about hazards, like
bridges that get slippery in the rain or bumps in the road. And the
purpose of a dog's growl is to warn another dog (or human) that it's
stressed or fearful. A warning is a helpful message, no matter what
form it comes in, and to warn is to send this message. The Old English
root is warnian, "give notice of impending danger."

I should warn you though, that this is not meant to be a self-help
book, or some model for how to live a happier and fuller life, or
anything like that.
* din :misc:

Walk into the average school cafeteria at lunchtime, and you'll get a
good sense of what a din is — loud, confused, continuous, generally
unpleasant, and often potentially headache-inducing noise.

Who knew noise pollution was a problem in ancient times? Humans have
been experiencing loud, sustained, annoying sounds for centuries,
judging by the etymology of the word din. It traces its roots back to
Old English dyne or dynn, which had the same meaning as din does
today, only with a different pronunciation. Before that, it popped up
in Old Norse as dynr and meant to "come rumbling down" — fitting, from
the language that gave us Thor, the God of Thunder.

Would you like to be stuffed head first into a tube, a cold and
confining one, where you’re not allowed to move? For hours at a time?
A tube that makes incredibly loud noises, an ongoing din of clicks and
screeches like an enraged metal dolphin?
* fairly :misc:
[2021-04-06 Tue 19:46]

When you do something fairly, you treat everyone with equal
consideration. Sharing a pizza fairly between six people is easy: just
give each person one slice.

A teacher who doesn't treat all students fairly isn't a very good
teacher — and a police officer who doesn't act fairly toward all
citizens is also doing a poor job. When you behave fairly, you're
unbiased and impartial, and you follow the rules. You can also use
this adverb to mean "to a large degree" or "reasonably." For example,
you could say, "I'm fairly certain that it's going to snow again
tomorrow."

It may not sound that impressive, but this activity is essentially the
basis of our mind and consciousness, in much the same way that
individual cells make up our body (cells combine in complex ways to
form tissues, which combine in complex ways to form organs, which
combine to form one functioning entity that is you). Scientifically
speaking, this is a fairly big deal.
* utterly :misc:
[2021-04-06 Tue 19:49]

Utterly is an intensifying word: something utterly delicious is very,
very delicious.

One thing people love to do is exaggerate. You often hear people
talking about how awesome or awful things are. When you're laying it
on thick, utterly is an utterly useful word: it means something
similar to completely, totally, or very. Something utterly
disappointing is extremely disappointing. Something utterly wonderful
is wonderful times ten. When you get tired of writing very, utterly is
a good word choice.

So of course happiness comes from the brain. But that’s like being
asked where Southampton is and replying ‘the solar system’; correct,
but utterly unhelpful.
* reward :misc:
[2021-04-06 Tue 20:05]

A reward is something you get for a job well done. If you study hard
for that vocabulary test, an "A" might be the reward in your future.

You can use reward as a verb, as when the mayor rewards a firefighter
who saves a family from a terrible blaze, or as a noun, to talk about
the actual payment or item that's given to the firefighter. People
often offer a reward for the return of lost or stolen things, like
bicycles or jewelry or dogs. Reward meant "a regarding" or "an
observation" in the 1300's, but it soon came to mean "repayment for
some service."

Dopamine is an obvious one. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that fulfils a
wide variety of functions in the brain, but one of the most familiar and
established is its role in reward and pleasure.
* perilous                                                             :misc:
[2021-04-06 Tue 20:06]

Something that is dangerous or very risky can be described with the
adjective perilous. If you are driving in a blizzard, you may kick
yourself for making such a perilous journey.

The adjective perilous comes from the Latin word periculum, meaning
dangerous. Words from the same root include peril, a noun meaning a
dangerous situation, and imperil, a verb meaning to put in danger. The
last thing you want to do as a parent is to imperil your
children. Unfortunately, childhood is filled with peril — from
climbing on the monkey bars to eating paste, dirt, or bugs. If you
think you can prevent all perilous situations, you haven't been a
parent very long!

Whenever the brain recognises that you’ve done something it approves
of (drunk water while thirsty, escaped a perilous situation, been
sexually intimate with a partner, etc.), it typically rewards this
behaviour by causing you to experience brief but often intense
pleasure triggered by the release of dopamine. And pleasure makes you
happy, right?


* surge :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:38]

A surge is a sudden strong swelling, like a tsunami wave that engulfs
the land. Although a surge offers a fluid image, anything can
experience a sudden surge, including emotions, political support, or
an angry mob.

The original Latin word surgere, meaning “to spring up or rise,”
serves as the basis for the word surge, which refers to a great sudden
growth or swelling.  If you are watching a sad movie and you
experience a sudden surge of emotion, do you quietly reach for a
tissue, pretend something's in your eye, or simply weep and sob with
reckless abandon?  Yeah, me too.  Christmas shopping can be dangerous
when there is a surge of interest in one toy and desperate shoppers
surge into stores trying to grab it up.

Expected rewards correspond with an initial dopamine surge, which then
tails off. But unexpected rewards correspond with an increased level
of dopamine release for a longer period after the reward is
experienced.
* gorging :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:41]

A gorge is a very deep crevice between two mountains or hills. Gorges
are formed by rivers running through and eroding rock over a very long
period of time.

The Latin root of gorge means "throat," leading to both the "narrow
passage" meaning and the French gorgier, "to swallow," which
influenced the verb version of gorge, "to overeat." You may love to
gorge on ice cream, but the stomachache afterward won't be very
pleasant. To remember the "canyon" meaning, think of the famous
upstate New York bumper sticker, “Ithaca is gorges.” It's a play on
gorgeous, meaning beautiful, and the beautiful ravines in the area.

Of course, endorphin neurotransmitters are the ‘big daddy’ of
pleasure-causing chemicals. Whether they are released from gorging on
chocolate or due to the rush of sex, endorphins provide that
oh-so-wonderful intense giddy warm sensation that permeates your very
being.

When you live in a big city like New York, you know all too well how
the smells of spices and cooking meats can permeate a hallway, easily
passing through those thin apartment doors to make your mouth water.

The verb permeate literally means to "pass through." It's often used
to describe smells or liquids that not only pass through, but also
spread to fill an entire area. When you bake cookies, you'll notice
that the rich, sweet smell of those cookies isn't confined just to
your oven — it permeates the entire kitchen and even the whole
house. In science class, you might have learned about a permeable
membrane — a thin material that is porous enough to let liquids or
gases to pass through.

Of course, endorphin neurotransmitters are the ‘big daddy’ of
pleasure-causing chemicals. Whether they are released from gorging on
chocolate or due to the rush of sex, endorphins provide that
oh-so-wonderful intense giddy warm sensation that permeates your very
being.6
* debilitating :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:42]

Something that's debilitating seriously affects someone or something's
strength or ability to carry on with regular activities, like a
debilitating illness.

Debilitating comes from the Latin word debilis, meaning "weak." That's
why you'll often see the adjective used to describe illness. After
all, serious diseases weaken the body. Other things that can be
debilitating are those that can stop you from reaching a goal, like a
debilitating snow storm that forces you to stay home, or debilitating
shyness that keeps you from reaching out to the people you want to
meet.

They’re obviously pleasurable (hence the alarming number of people who
use them), but these drugs are also clearly debilitating.
* drooling :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:43]

The dampness that forms in your mouth when you smell something
delicious is drool. When it actually drips from your mouth, you drool.

The official term for drool is saliva. Babies drool, dogs drool — we
all drool sometimes. Sometimes people drool (or salivate) because of
problems with their salivary glands. You might drool when you skip
breakfast and your friend offers you a warm, homemade cinnamon
roll. The word comes from drivel, which today means "speak nonsense,"
but originally had the sense of "to slobber or run at the nose."

Someone in the grip of an intense opiate ‘high’ isn’t much good for
anything other than staring into space and occasionally drooling.
* facilitate :misc:

To facilitate means to make something easier. If your best friend is
very shy, you could facilitate her efforts to meet new people.

Facilitate comes from the Latin facilis, for "easy." It means to make
something easier or more likely to happen. You facilitate growth or a
process, as opposed to, say, dinner.  Often in business meetings
someone will be assigned to facilitate a discussion so people don't
just sit in awkward silence. Synonyms are ease, simplify, expedite,
and assist.

Mothers use many terms to describe childbirth – ‘miraculous’, ‘incredible’,
‘amazing’, and so on – but ‘enjoyable’ is rarely among them. And yet despite
the extreme physical demands it places on a woman’s body, they get through
it, and often do it again. This is because human women have evolved many
different adaptations to facilitate childbirth, and one of these is the
build-up and release of endorphins as it progresses.
* dampen :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:45]

To dampen something is to stifle it, to lessen its effect, or to
moisten it. Getting a cold will dampen your enthusiasm.

This word has several related meanings, most of which make something
less effective or powerful. Using a towel will dampen it in the sense
of getting it wet, but dampening goes beyond things that are damp
(wet). Bad news will dampen your mood, bringing it down. Boxing gloves
dampen the force of punches because they cushion the blows. Anything
dampened has been weakened and brought down a notch.

The brain deploys endorphins to dampen the pain and stop it from reaching
heart-stopping levels (which can happen8). This could also contribute to the
almost deliriously happy state women experience the moment the baby is born
(although that’s possibly just relief). Thanks to endorphins, childbirth, no
matter how gruelling it is, could be worse.

* contentment :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:50]

Contentment is the state of being happy and satisfied. On Thanksgiving
when you think about all you are grateful for, hopefully you feel a
sense of contentment. If not, have another piece of pie and then
you’ll feel contentment.

Contentment isn’t an excited kind of happy, it’s more like a peaceful
ease of mind. It’s being satisfied with what you have, whatever that
is. You might feel a sense of contentment knowing you have a cup of
hot chocolate and a good movie to look forward to tonight. Or you
might experience contentment thinking about the vast estate you just
purchased in the Hamptons. Whatever is going on in your life, you’re
pleased about it.

Life is more than just a series of euphoric moments. Happiness is also
about contentment, satisfaction, love, relationships, family,
motivation, wellbeing, and many other words found in Facebook
memes.

* cuddle :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:51]

To cuddle is to embrace in a loving, affectionate way. If you're
having a terrible day, you probably wish you could just go home, get
in bed, and cuddle with your cat.

Cuddle might come from the Middle English couth, "known" — after all,
you only cuddle with those you know. Or, cuddle may have started as
baby talk that caught on. When you cuddle, you give a snuggly hug to
make yourself or another person feel loved or comforted. As a noun,
cuddle describes the time of the embrace, like having one last cuddle
before leaving for a long trip.

One contender would be oxytocin. Oxytocin has an unusual reputation, often
being described as the ‘love’ hormone, or the ‘cuddle’ hormone.
* fidelity :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:53]

Fidelity is the quality of being faithful or loyal. Dogs are famous
for their fidelity.

Fidelity comes from the Latin root fides, which means faith, so
fidelity is the state of being faithful. Marital fidelity is
faithfulness to your spouse. If you're a journalist, your reports
should have fidelity to the facts.  Someone without fidelity to a
religion or group belief is called an infidel.

However, oxytocin has since been implicated in a much wider variety of
situations: sexual arousal and responses, stress, social interaction,
fidelity, and no doubt much more.

This has a number of weird consequences. For instance, oxytocin is
important for forming and enhancing social bonds but it is also
released during sexual intercourse.
* longing :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:54]

A longing is a strong feeling of need or desire for someone or
something. If you're stuck in detention and all of your friends are
outside enjoying a sunny day, you might be looking out the window with
longing.

A longing describes an unfulfilled desire. The days might feel long as
long as you are longing to see someone you love, if that person is far
away. You might be longing for your mother's home-made chicken soup,
if you are sick and far from home. Or perhaps you are a pregnant
woman, wide awake and longing for pickles and ice-cream at four in the
morning. Let's hope there's a twenty-four hour deli open somewhere to
help satisfy your longing.

Thanks to oxytocin, sexual interaction can fundamentally alter your
perception of your partner, changing purely physical attraction into
genuine affection and longing.
* warier :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:55]

Describe yourself as wary if you don't quite trust someone or
something and want to proceed with caution. Be wary of risky things
like wild mushrooms and Internet deals!

You can trace wary through Old English back to Old High German giwar
"aware, attentive." If you keep a wary eye on something, you are
attentive for signs that it is becoming dangerous. Likewise, if you
give someone a wary glance, your face conveys the suspicion and
caution you feel. When you are wary of driving alone at night or
making promises, you fear something bad might happen if you do these
things.

The conclusion drawn here is that increased oxytocin makes men more
committed to their partner, making them more aware of how their
actions might impact on them, meaning they’d be warier of interacting
with unfamiliar attractive women, especially when others are there to
see it.
* TODO wary
* hostility :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:57]

Hostility is the state of ill will and bad feeling. If a teacher
embarrasses you in front of the whole class, you will probably regard
him or her with hostility for the remainder of the school year.

Hostility can be used to describe aggressive relations between two
countries as well as between people. The issue of territorial borders
can often cause hostility between neighboring countries. If actual
fighting breaks out, use the word hostilities to refer to the violent
actions between them. The ordinary citizens of the countries involved
will look forward to the end of hostilities when the two governments
are able to work together for peace.

Not quite. As with most things, oxytocin has a down side. For instance,
increasing your social bonds with an individual or a group can increase your
hostility to anyone outside that bond.
* TODO hostile
* ascribe :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:57]

Ascribe means to give credit to, like if you ascribe the A you got on
your group project to the hard work of your partners!

Ascribe's Latin root is ascribere, meaning basically "to write in.''
Makes sense, because ascribe is often used to link writers to their
words. Many a quirky quote, like "Age is an issue of mind over
matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter," is ascribed to that
famous scribe Mark Twain. It can also be a way of blaming something —
you might ascribe your bad attitude to your mom because she won't let
you have cupcakes for dinner.

One study found that men dosed with oxytocin were much quicker to
ascribe negative traits to anyone not from their culture or ethnic
background.
* integral :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:58]

/ˈɪntɪɡr(ə)l,ɪnˈtɛɡr(ə)l/
Something that is integral is very important or necessary. If you are
an integral part of the team, it means that the team cannot function
without you.

An integral part is necessary to complete the whole. In this sense,
the word essential is a near synonym. In mathematics, there are
integrals of functions and equations. Integral is from Middle English,
from Medieval Latin integralis "making up a whole," from Latin integer
"untouched, entire."

Not quite. As with most things, oxytocin has a down side. For
instance, increasing your social bonds with an individual or a group
can increase your hostility to anyone outside that bond. One study
found that men dosed with oxytocin were much quicker to ascribe
negative traits to anyone not from their culture or ethnic
background.15 Or, to put it another way, oxytocin makes you racist. If
racism is integral to happiness, then I’m not sure humans deserve it.
* resentment :misc:
[2021-04-07 Wed 17:58]

Resentment, or the strong and painful bitterness you feel when someone
does something wrong to you, doesn’t have actual physical weight, but
it feels very heavy and can last a long time. Forgiveness is one way
to get rid of resentment.

Sometimes resentment lasts for years. It can be strong and hard to
pull out, like an old, gnarled tree root. While resentment over being
wronged can come from just one act against you, it also can get
stronger over time, as in "your growing resentment might just come
from the fact that the team captain always picks you last." It also
comes from misunderstandings, like feeling resentment over a dirty
look you thought was directed at you but really wasn't. It's usually
best to root out resentment early.

It doesn’t have to be so extreme though; you’ve probably witnessed
someone (or even been that someone) experiencing bitter jealousy and
resentment, even hatred, when the object of their affection is seen to
interact in an overly friendly way with someone else.
* unanimously :Elephant:
[2021-04-08 Thu 17:46]

If a group decides something unanimously, it means that every single
member is in agreement. A vote passed unanimously has no one objecting
to it.

When Congress passes a bill unanimously, each member agrees that it
should become a law. Things that are done or agreed on unanimously
have no dissenters, no one arguing against them — it's as if the group
were thinking as a single entity. In fact, the root of unanimously is
the Latin unanimus, "of one mind," from unus, "one," and animus,
"mind."

We’re quite curious to see how the world reacts to our book. Early
reviews were almost unanimously positive, and we expect the typical
reader to accept roughly two-thirds of our claims about human motives
and institutions.

* bedrock :Elephant:
[2021-04-08 Thu 17:51]

Bedrock is the hard layer of rock beneath looser rocks and soil. In
some places, the bedrock is exposed, while in others it lies deep
underground.

A geologist who's interested in studying the bedrock in different
areas might have to dig through the various layers of soil to reach
that bedrock. You can also use the word in a figurative way, to mean
"the heart of the matter," or "the basic, fundamental principles." For
example, you might say that fairness and freedom is the bedrock of a
good government. The word combines bed — here meaning "plot of land" —
and rock.

As he immersed himself in the literature, however, he started noticing
data that didn’t add up, and soon he began to question even the most
basic, bedrock assumptions.

* considerable :Elephant:
[2021-04-08 Thu 17:55]

Use the adjective considerable to describe something that is large in
amount. Things you probably spend a considerable amount of time on:
homework and laundry. Things you'd rather spend time on: anything that
isn't homework and laundry!

The adjective considerable can describe something of importance and is
worthy of notice or respect. If you are an excellent singer, dancer,
musician, writer, or similar profession, people may ask you to donate
your considerable talents to charitable causes. If you're not an
excellent singer, dancer, musician, or writer, they will still ask you
to donate, but they are more likely to ask for money!

Altogether, these puzzles cast considerable doubt on the simple idea
that medicine is strictly about health.

* lurk                                                             :Elephant:
[2021-04-08 Thu 17:57]

To lurk is to creep around, hide out, and wait to attack. Your team’s
strategy for winning capture the flag might be to lurk in the bushes
for an hour until the opposing side thinks you gave up and went home.

The verb lurk means to move furtively or sneak around, usually while
you wait to pounce. Tigers lurk through the jungle, stalking their
prey, and creepy characters are always lurking in the shadows in
horror movies. Perhaps that's why you'll often hear people describe
not-so-safe places by saying that danger lurks at every turn.  Other
words for lurk include creep, prowl, and snoop.

Robin’s hypothesis is that a similar transaction lurks within our modern
medical system, except we don’t notice it because it’s masked by all the
genuine healing that takes place.

* lenient :Elephant:
[2021-04-08 Thu 17:59]

If you're not overly strict, and you show tolerance and mercy when
someone does something wrong, you're being lenient.

Lenient means tolerant or relaxed, and is usually used when we’re
talking about someone’s attitude toward discipline. In 19th-century
child-rearing books, we often read about strict teachers who punish
children just for squirming in their seats. These days teachers are
more likely to be lenient, more understanding. If you're a big fan of
discipline and punishment, however, lenient might mean "soft" or
"indulgent."

And it’s not just doctors who are on the “kissing” or supportive side
of the transaction, but everyone who helps the patient along the way:
the spouse who insists on the doctor’s visit, the friend who watches
the kids, the boss who’s lenient about work deadlines, and even the
institutions, like employers and national governments, that sponsored
the patient’s health insurance in the first place.

* conspicuous :Elephant:
[2021-04-08 Thu 18:00]

Keep your eye on the adjective conspicuous for something that stands
out so much you notice it right away — like that zit in the center of
your friend's forehead.

Conspicuous comes from the adjectival form of the Latin verb,
conspicere, meaning "to look at." Conspicuous can mean either very
obvious to the eye (like something that is conspicuous from a
distance) or attracting attention (like conspicuous consumption). If
you are doing something wrong, it's wise not to be conspicuous about
it!

The conclusion is that medicine isn’t just about health—it’s also an
exercise in conspicuous caring.

* morph                                                            :Elephant:
[2021-04-08 Thu 18:03]

To morph is to change from one shape to another. A cute bunny, for
example, might morph into a killer dragon in a fairy tale or an
animated film.

Morph comes from the word metamorphosis, which is a Greek word meaning
"a transforming." As a verb, it has only been around since the 1980s,
when computers allowed animators to make things change shape in an
apparently seamlessly way. With the right skills, you can morph a
toaster into a highly intelligent robot that helps fight crime, offers
dating advice to the protagonist of the film, and still makes an
excellent piece of toast.

An office full of software engineers soon morphed, under the
flickering fluorescent lights, into a tribe of chattering primates.

* unaware :Elephant:
[2021-04-08 Thu 18:10]

Unaware is simply the opposite of "aware." If you are unaware, you
have no idea what's going on.

To be unaware is to be totally incognizant (but not incontinent). To
be "caught unawares" means you were caught off guard or by
surprise. Either way you've got your head in the clouds about
something. Now some people might say that ignorance is bliss, but the
guy in the crosswalk who was unaware of the bus barreling down on him
at full speed might disagree.

So shouldn’t it stand to reason that we’d be hyper-conscious of our
deepest biological incentives? And yet, most of the time, we seem
almost willfully unaware of them.

* flinch :Elephant:
[2021-04-08 Thu 18:11]

To flinch is to react to pain by wincing, pulling away, or
cringing. Often it's used to describe a person who shows a moment of
weakness or fright: he was so tough, I thought he'd never flinch, but
snakes really freak him out.

To flinch is to pull away suddenly or recoil when something frightens
or hurts you. People flinch at different things. Needles, for example,
cause some people to flinch, while they're not even noticed by
others. If you can withstand something awful without showing it,
you're likely to hear someone say "Wow! You didn't even flinch!" Think
of it as a combination of flee and pinch. If you don't flee when you
get pinched, you don't flinch.

It’s not that we’re literally incapable of perceiving these motives
within our psyches. We all know they’re there. And yet they make us
uncomfortable, so we mentally flinch away.

* ploy :Elephant:
[2021-04-09 Fri 10:15]

A ploy is a clever plan that helps you get what you want. A
manipulative little girl might shed tears simply as a ploy to get her
mother to buy her ice cream.

A politician might add amendments to a bill as a ploy to delay voting,
or a hooligan might yell, "Fire!" in a movie theater as a ploy to
sneak his friends in. A sneaky move in a game is a ploy, and
sensational news about a celebrity can be just a ploy to get him more
media attention. The first recorded use of ploy was in 1722, meaning
"anything with which one amuses oneself" in Scottish and Northern
English dialects.

Self-deception is therefore strategic, a ploy our brains use to look good
while behaving badly. Understandably, few people are eager to confess to this
kind of duplicity. But as long as we continue to tiptoe around it, we’ll be
unable to think clearly about human behavior. We’ll be forced to distort or
deny any explanation that harks back to our hidden motives. Key facts will
remain taboo, and we’ll forever be mystified by our own thoughts and actions.
* duplicity :Elephant:
[2021-04-09 Fri 10:16]

Though he said he didn't know anything about the footprints in the new
sidewalk, his duplicity, or deceitfulness, was obvious from the cement
caking his shoes. His mouth said one thing, his feet said another.

Many words with "du" have meanings with "two" or "duo." Duplicity is
from a Latin word meaning "twofold, having two parts." Someone who
shows duplicity is two-faced — maybe showing one side in public and
another in private — or is just a liar, saying something known to be
untrue or misleading. A fraud uses duplicity to gain something with
false promises, and someone described as "fake" might use duplicity
just to fit in or be accepted.

Self-deception is therefore strategic, a ploy our brains use to look
good while behaving badly. Understandably, few people are eager to
confess to this kind of duplicity.

* hark                                                             :Elephant:
[2021-04-09 Fri 10:18]

Hark! This is an old fashioned word for “listen up!” Hark also means
“to look back.” If you ride a horse to school, your behavior harks
back to the days before cars.

Hark is an order to pay attention and listen carefully, but it also
means to go back to or remember something from the past. Hark has an
interesting origin: it comes from the term "to hark back," which was
when hunting dogs retraced the scent of their prey when they had lost
it to try to pick it up again. Using hark these days sounds very
literary and old fashioned. It harks back to ye olde times.

We’ll be forced to distort or deny any explanation that harks back to
our hidden motives. Key facts will remain taboo, and we’ll forever be
mystified by our own thoughts and actions.

[2021-04-09 Fri 10:21]

Confront means either to face a situation that makes you
uncomfortable, or to say something to someone about something they've
done that bothers you. Rather than letting things go, when people are
rude to you you should confront them.

Confront derives from the Latin con- "with" and -front "front." You
can confront a sad truth, you can confront a person by calling them on
their behavior, you can confront someone with the fact that they have
terrible breath. You can be confronted, too—on the trip through the
mountains, we were confronted by the impassibility of the road.

It’s only by confronting the elephant, then, that we can begin to see
what’s really going on.

* unsavory :Elephant:
[2021-04-09 Fri 10:21]

Call something unsavory if it's unappetizing, tasteless, or morally
offensive. Curdled sour milk is pretty unsavory, as are the dirty
details of the latest political scandal.

The adjective unsavory was formed by merging un, meaning “not,” with
savory, meaning “pleasant, agreeable.” So if it's unsavory, it's
unpleasant. First used to describe revolting tastes, unsavory now also
applies to just about anything that figuratively leaves a bad taste in
your mouth. Mobsters do all kinds of unsavory things to the people
that cross them. So you probably shouldn't hang out with such unsavory
characters.

Again, it’s not that we’re completely unaware of our unsavory
motives—far from it. Many are readily apparent to anyone who chooses
to look.

* shrift :Elephant:
[2021-04-09 Fri 10:23]

Use the noun shrift to describe the act of confessing, especially to a
priest.

Shrift is an old-fashioned way to talk about the traditional religious
ritual of confession and absolution. Shrift comes from the equally
antique word shrive, which is what a priest does when he hears a
confession. The phrase "short shrift" began as a description of the
brief chance a condemned prisoner had to confess his sins before being
put to death, and evolved to mean "to dismiss with little
consideration."

But generally, we prefer to ignore the elephant, and as a result, we
systematically give short shrift to explanations of our behavior that
call attention to it.

* intrinsic :Money:
[2021-04-09 Fri 10:57]

The intrinsic qualities of something have to do with its nature. An
intrinsic quality of dogs is that they're loyal.

Anything intrinsic comes from within. Doing a job for only money is
not intrinsic. Doing a job because you love it is intrinsic; the
motivation comes from within. It's good to treat people as having
intrinsic value. If you like someone for intrinsic reasons, then you
have no other motivation. The opposite of intrinsic is extrinsic, for
things that come from the outside instead of from the inside.

Money’s greatest intrinsic value—and this can’t be overstated—is its
ability to give you control over your time.

* obtain :Money:
[2021-04-09 Fri 10:58]

Obtain means to get something that is not so easy to come by such as
knowledge, rights, or a large amount of money. You wouldn't say you
obtained a pair of pants, unless they were one of a kind.

At times in its history, obtain has meant to be victorious or to
succeed. Today, it mostly means to acquire, but keeping its prior
meanings in mind helps you to use it in the right way. College degrees
are something that you obtain as is permission from your parents to go
to a party. When you obtain something, you have worked hard to get it,
so you are pretty happy to have it.

To obtain, bit by bit, a level of independence and autonomy that comes
from unspent assets that give you greater control over what you can do
and when you can do it.

[2021-04-09 Fri 11:13]

A recluse lives alone, works alone, eats alone, and generally stays
away from other people. Anti-social old hermits are recluses, as are a
lot of students during exam time.

In the early 13th century, a recluse was a person who shut out the
world to go meditate on religious issues. But nowadays recluses can
think about whatever they want while they're sitting in solitude —
they're simply people who shy away from social interaction and live
secluded lives. Or think of the Brown Recluse spider, who likes to
hide out in dark old boots or undisturbed corners of the basement.

He was also a recluse, spending most of his time by himself. He rarely
spoke, deliberately making himself inaccessible and staying quiet when
you caught his attention.

[2021-04-10 Sat 10:37]

Use pungent to describe a taste or smell that gives a sharp
sensation. "What is that pungent odor?" is a polite way of suggesting
that someone in the room has BO.

The ultimate source of the word pungent is Latin pungere "to prick,
sting." Ginger and mustard seed are examples of pungent
spices. Limburger cheese has the distinction of being the most pungent
of all cheeses. And if your pet has an accident in the house, there
may be a pungent odor. And pungent can be used in a figurative sense:
pungent language is stimulating and expressive.

In the wind are pungent odors from the marshes by the road. We are in
an area of the Central Plains filled with thousands of duck hunting
sloughs, heading northwest from Minneapolis toward the Dakotas.
* marsh :Zen:
[2021-04-10 Sat 10:37]

A marsh is an area in transition from land to water. It is a very bad
idea to go walking in a marsh in your best shoes; try some fishing
boots, or perhaps a boat.

The word marsh comes from the old Dutch word mere, for sea, and it
means land that is sea-ish… not sea, but sea-ish, like most of
Holland. Marshes can be found often where a river empties into the
sea, or along the side of a low, flooded river. Another word for marsh
is swamp. If you’re in trouble or just want to be alone, a marsh is a
great place to hide: no one will follow you. Just don’t forget your
galoshes.

This highway is an old concrete two-laner that hasn't had much
traffic since a four-laner went in parallel to it several years
ago. When we pass a marsh the air suddenly becomes cooler. Then, when
we are past, it suddenly warms up again.

[2021-04-10 Sat 10:39]

Muck is a goopy, muddy substance, like the muck at the bottom of a
pond or the muck you clean out of the gutters on your house once a
year.

You can also use muck to mean animal manure, its original,
13th-century meaning — specifically, "cow dung and vegetable matter
used as manure." The definition has expanded since then to include any
number of dirty, slimy substances, from the mud on the bottom of a
lake to the sludge in a flooded basement. As a verb, to muck is either
to remove animal waste or to spread manure on a field.

The pungent smell then was from muck stirred up by hip boots while we
were getting in position for the sun to come up and the duck season to
open.
* sloughs :Zen:
[2021-04-10 Sat 10:40]

When you slough, you get rid of the rough. To slough is to remove an
outer layer, like filing dry skin from feet. You can slough away
emotions too, like the heebie-jeebies you get thinking about dead skin
from people's feet. Ew.

Slough rhymes with "rough." It doesn't sound as though it'll give you
a beautiful result, but when you slough away old skin, new skin
appears. Snakes shed or slough off their skins as they grow and get
rid of icky cells, and humans do the same, though fortunately we don't
slough off one big skin as snakes do. Maybe it's best to slough off
that mental image with a nicer one.

Or winters when the sloughs were frozen over and dead and I could walk
across the ice and snow between the dead cattails and see nothing but
grey skies and dead things and cold. The blackbirds were gone then.

* dwell :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:09]

To dwell in a home is to live in it. To dwell on something — usually
something bad, like a failed romance or terrible service in a
restaurant — is to think or speak about it at great length.

Dwell has been part of the English language for over 1,000 years. The
definition of the word has evolved considerably since its first
recorded use in the 9th century when Old English dwellan meant "lead
astray" or "hinder." If you constantly dwell on the bad things in
life, it could hinder you from seeing the good or lead you astray to
the negative. If you keep complaining, your friends might tell you to
stop dwelling on it or, if they're really annoyed, they'll say, "Get
over it!"

In light of this, it’s important to emphasize where we’re coming from. The line between
cynicism and misanthropy—between thinking ill of human motives and thinking ill of
humans—is often blurry. So we want readers to understand that although we may be
skeptical of human motives, we love human beings. (Indeed, many of our best friends are
human!) We aren’t trying to put our species down or rub people’s noses in their own
shortcomings. We’re just taking some time to dwell on the parts of human nature that
don’t get quite as much screen time. All in all, we doubt an honest exploration will detract
much from our affection for these fine creatures.
* commencement :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:09]

A commencement is the act of starting out, or blazing a new trail.

The suffix -ment makes the word commencement a noun — a thing, an
activity, a start. The word can be used for the beginning of anything,
from a business meeting to a vacation trip to a marriage. Anything
that begins has a moment of commencement. That's why a graduation
ceremony is called a commencement — a graduate is embarking on a new
life, and the commencement ritual marks the official beginning of that
life.

Consider how some ideas are more naturally viral than others. When a theory emphasizes
altruism, cooperation, and other feel-good motives, for example, people naturally want to
share it, perhaps even shout it from the rooftops: “By working together, we can achieve
great things!” It reflects well on both speakers and listeners to be associated with
something so inspirational. This is the recipe for ideas that draw large audiences and
receive standing ovations, the time-honored premise of sermons, TED talks,
commencement speeches, and presidential inaugurations.
* shove :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:10]



nil

This book attempts to shine light on just those dark, unexamined facets of public life:
venerated social institutions in which almost all participants are strategically
self-deceived, markets in which both buyers and sellers pretend to transact one thing
while covertly transacting another. The art scene, for example, isn’t just about
“appreciating beauty”; it also functions as an excuse to affiliate with impressive people
and as a sexual display (a way to hobnob and get laid). Education isn’t just about
learning; it’s largely about getting graded, ranked, and credentialed, stamped for the
approval of employers. Religion isn’t just about private belief in God or the afterlife, but
about conspicuous public professions of belief that help bind groups together. In each of
these areas, our hidden agendas explain a surprising amount of our behavior—often a
majority. When push comes to shove, we often make choices that prioritize our hidden
agendas over the official ones.
* conspicuous :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:11]

Keep your eye on the adjective conspicuous for something that stands
out so much you notice it right away — like that zit in the center of
your friend's forehead.

Conspicuous comes from the adjectival form of the Latin verb,
conspicere, meaning "to look at." Conspicuous can mean either very
obvious to the eye (like something that is conspicuous from a
distance) or attracting attention (like conspicuous consumption). If
you are doing something wrong, it's wise not to be conspicuous about
it!

* hobnob :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:12]

To hobnob is to spend time or hang out with someone, especially at a
social event. When you're invited to a fancy benefit party at a
museum, you might get to hobnob with socialites and minor celebrities.

When you hobnob, you mingle or pal around with fancy folks. People who
work in book publishing occasionally get to hobnob with writers, and
if you get a job on a movie set, you may have a chance to hobnob with
movie stars. Hobnob first meant "to drink to one another," or "to
toast each other." In Britain, a HobNob is also a popular cookie or
biscuit brand.

* profiteering :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:12]

To profiteer is to take advantage of a situation or a person in order
to make money. A landlord might profiteer during a housing shortage by
doubling rents.

When you profiteer, you don't just profit — you profit more than you
should at the expense of someone else. You can also call a person who
does this a profiteer. Profiteers famously take advantage of things
like scarce food or ongoing conflicts to make a lot of money. The word
existed but wasn't commonly used in English until World War I, when
journalists started talking about "war profiteers" who benefited
financially from shortages and desperation.

Here’s another way to look at it. The world is full of people acting on motives they’d rather
not acknowledge. But most of the time, opposing interest groups are eager to call them
out for it. For example, when U.S. bankers angled for a bailout during the 2008 financial
crisis, they argued that it would benefit the entire economy, conveniently neglecting to
mention that it would line their own pockets. Thankfully, many others stood ready to
accuse them of profiteering. Similarly, during the Bush administration, U.S. antiwar
protestors—most of whom were liberal—justified their efforts in terms of the harms of
war. And yet when Obama took over as president, they drastically reduced their protests,
even though the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continued unabated.6 All this suggested an
agenda that was more partisan than pacifist, and conservative critics were happy to point
out the disconnect.7
* accuse :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:13]

If you charge someone with misdeeds or misconduct, you accuse that
person. If the last piece of devil's food cake is missing, your sister
may accuse you of eating it — especially if you have chocolate on your
mouth.

The verb accuse comes from the Latin word accusare, which itself is
formed from the roots ad, meaning toward, and causa, reason or
lawsuit. "Cause," "excuse," and even "ruse" are all from that same
root word. Today, if you're accused of a crime, you may still be
headed toward a lawsuit. However, to accuse someone of a crime doesn't
necessarily make them guilty — plenty of people have been falsely
accused.

* devious :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:13]

Devious describes someone who tends to lie and to trick other
people. Devious credit card companies lure younger and younger people
into debt with offers of low interest rates and even just free
t-shirts.

Devious sometimes just describes a path that is not direct, a meaning
that can be traced to the Latin adjective devius "out of the way,"
formed from the prefix de- "off" plus via "way, road." The related
English verb deviate means to do something different or unexpected,
and the adjective deviant describes behavior that is not considered
normal or morally correct.

2.Cognitive and social psychology. The study of cognitive biases and self-deception has
matured considerably in recent years. We now realize that our brains aren’t just hapless
and quirky—they’re devious. They intentionally hide information from us, helping us
fabricate plausible prosocial motives to act as cover stories for our less savory agendas. As
Trivers puts it: “At every single stage [of processing information]—from its biased arrival,
to its biased encoding, to organizing it around false logic, to misremembering and then
misrepresenting it to others—the mind continually acts to distort information flow in favor
of the usual goal of appearing better than one really is.”5 Emily Pronin calls it the
introspection illusion, the fact that we don’t know our own minds nearly as well as we
pretend to. For the price of a little self-deception, we get to have our cake and eat it too:
act in our own best interests without having to reveal ourselves as the self-interested
schemers we often are.
* covert :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:13]

Covert means secret or hidden. Soldiers might take part in a covert
mission to infiltrate an enemy camp — and you might take part in a
covert mission to steal your brother's leftover Halloween candy.

Covert is the opposite of overt, which means obvious, or in full
view. Covert things are hidden, private, or stealthy. It comes from
the Old French covert, or "covered." A covert bag of chips you've
snuck into the movie theater might literally be covered, hidden under
your coat, while a covert plan to throw your dad a surprise party is
just a secret.

Because of this, we must take covert agendas into account when thinking about these
institutions, or risk radically misunderstanding them.
* flaunting :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:14]

Flaunt is "to display proudly or show off," like when you flaunt your
new Italian leather jacket by wearing it to the beach and pretending
you're cold to make sure everyone sees it.

Although we love it when a peacock flaunts his colorful feathers, when
a person does the same thing we feel bad. Flaunt is like bragging,
which can bum people out because they don't have whatever you're
showing off, like that cool jacket. When rich people flaunt their
wealth by speeding past you in their limo, they may as well splash a
mud puddle on your white clothes. Leave the flaunting for peacocks and
stars in bad reality TV shows.

We start with evolutionary psychology, but we don’t end there. We continue to seek
hidden motives at larger social levels, taking inspiration from Thorstein Veblen, an
economist and sociologist writing roughly a century ago. Veblen famously coined the term
“conspicuous consumption” to explain the demand for luxury goods. When consumers are
asked why they bought an expensive watch or high-end handbag, they often cite material
factors like comfort, aesthetics, and functionality. But Veblen argued that, in fact, the
demand for luxury goods is driven largely by a social motive: flaunting one’s wealth. More
recently, the psychologist Geoffrey Miller has made similar arguments from an
evolutionary perspective, and we draw heavily from his work as well.
* squabbles :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:16]

A squabble is a fight but not necessarily a serious one. When we
squabble, we have a little argument, probably about something not too
important.

Do you notice how squabble sounds kind of funny? That's a clue that a
squabble is not the most serious kind of argument or fight. A loud,
screaming fight would never be called a squabble. A small, silly
discussion about something small or trivial is more of a
squabble. Friends and family members squabble all the time.

But the biggest revelation from Boehm’s book concerned social status. Of course office
workers, being primates, are constantly jockeying to keep or improve their position in the
hierarchy, whether by dominance displays, squabbles over territory, or active
confrontations. None of these behaviors is surprising to find in a species as social and
political as ours. What’s interesting is how people obfuscate all this social competition by
dressing it up in clinical business jargon. Richard doesn’t complain about Karen by
saying, “She gets in my way”; he accuses her of “not caring enough about the customer.”
* outings :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:17]

An outing is a short trip, especially one that takes no longer than a
day. For example, you might ask your pal if he'd like to go on an
outing to the zoo.

A summer outing might be a picnic or a day at the beach, while a
winter outing could consist of a hike in the snow or a shopping trip
and lunch at a restaurant. Any brief, fun journey can be called an
outing. In the fourteenth century, an outing was simply the "action of
going out," and in the fifteenth century it started to mean "act of
putting out" as well. By the 1800s it had gained today's definition.

Initially, Kevin took the startup scene for a straightforward exercise in company-building:
gather some people together; give them time to think, talk, and write code; and
eventually, like Legos clicking into place, out pops useful software. Then he read Hierarchy
in the Forest by anthropologist Christopher Boehm, a book that analyzes human societies
with the same concepts used to analyze chimpanzee communities. After reading Boehm’s
book, Kevin began to see his environment very differently. An office full of software
engineers soon morphed, under the flickering fluorescent lights, into a tribe of chattering
primates. All-hands meetings, shared meals, and team outings became elaborate social
grooming sessions. Interviews began to look like thinly veiled initiation rituals. The
company logo took on the character of a tribal totem or religious symbol.
* scurrying :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:18]



nil

Now, we don’t expect our readers to believe this explanation just yet. We’ll examine it in
more detail in Chapter 14. What’s important is getting a feel for the kind of explanation
we’re proposing. First, we’re suggesting that key human behaviors are often driven by
multiple motives—even behaviors that seem pretty single-minded, like giving and
receiving medical care. This shouldn’t be too surprising; humans are complex creatures,
after all. But second, and more importantly, we’re suggesting that some of these motives
are unconscious; we’re less than fully aware of them. And they aren’t mere mouse-sized
motives, scurrying around discreetly in the back recesses of our minds. These are
elephant-sized motives large enough to leave footprints in national economic data.
* unanimously :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:19]

If a group decides something unanimously, it means that every single
member is in agreement. A vote passed unanimously has no one objecting
to it.

When Congress passes a bill unanimously, each member agrees that it
should become a law. Things that are done or agreed on unanimously
have no dissenters, no one arguing against them — it's as if the group
were thinking as a single entity. In fact, the root of unanimously is
the Latin unanimus, "of one mind," from unus, "one," and animus,
"mind."

We’re quite curious to see how the world reacts to our book. Early reviews were almost
unanimously positive, and we expect the typical reader to accept roughly two-thirds of
our claims about human motives and institutions. Yet, we find it hard to imagine the
book’s central thesis becoming widely accepted among any large population, even of
scholars. As better minds than ours have long advanced similar ideas, but to little
apparent effect, we suspect that human minds and cultures must contain sufficient
antibodies to keep such concepts at bay.
* mire                                                             :Elephant:
[2021-04-14 Wed 12:26]

When you're mired in something, you're stuck or entangled in it. You
can't get out.

Sometimes, being mired means to be literally trapped in the mire,
which is like a swamp or muck. But usually when people are mired, it's
in something less icky but equally hard to get out of. You could be
mired in six hours of homework. Congress could be mired in discussions
that are going nowhere. A bad relationship could be mired in
arguments. When you're mired, it feels like you're sinking in
quicksand.

Before we get mired in the complexities of human social life, let’s
start at a simpler beginning.

* placate                                                             :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:07]

If you placate someone, you stop them from being angry by giving them
something or doing something that pleases them. If your dad is annoyed
that you forgot to take out the trash, you might be able to placate
him by doing the dishes.

If your little sister is mad that the dog ate her favorite teddy bear,
you could placate her by buying her an ice cream cone. A near synonym
for placate is appease. The origin of placate is Latin placare, "to
calm or soothe." The related Latin verb placere is the source of
English please.

Fevers have always been as feared as they are mysterious. Ancient
Romans worshiped Febris, the Goddess who protected people from
fevers. Amulets were left at temples to placate her, hoping to stave
off the next round of shivers.
* concern                                                             :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:08]

If you're concerned, you're feeling worried. When your clumsy friend
announces his plans to become a stunt double, you should be concerned
for his safety, and if you're not, you're a lousy friend.

The adjective concerned has roots in Latin terms for seeing clearly,
as well as for being in relation to something. If you feel concerned,
say for your neighbor who just bet his savings on a horse race, that's
because you truly care for his well-being and you see that he's doing
something stupid. Sometimes we use concerned to show the limits of our
investment. As far as you are concerned, Madame X can jump off a
cliff! You don't care!

The organization today notes: “The main work that concerned
Wagner-Jauregg throughout his working life was the endeavour to cure
mental disease by inducing a fever.”
* hunch :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:09]

When you pose for pictures with short friends, you hunch over so you
don't tower above them — you scrunch up your shoulders, bend your
knees, and try to look smaller.

You can also have a hunch, which has nothing to do with
scrunching. When you have a hunch about something, you think it might
be true. Your dog bolts over the fence, and you have a hunch he's
heading for the neighbor who feeds him pâté. Hunch is an odd word of
unknown origin, which seems to have originally meant "to push or
shove" — to nudge.

Wagner-Jauregg assumed this was due to a hunch that had been around
for centuries but doctors didn’t understand well: fevers play a role
in helping the body fight infection.
* span                                                                :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:11]

Any distance between two things is called a span. These end points can
be physical, like the span of a rope between two trees, or they can be
more abstract, such as the span of time between five and six o'clock.

Span comes from the Old English spann, the width of the stretched-out
hand, measured from thumb to little finger. It came to refer to
various other measurements, such as the distance across an arch. The
first reference to a length of time came in the late 16th century, and
the phrase "attention span" first appeared in 1922 (as "span of
attention").

A hyper-connected world means the talent pool you compete in has gone
from hundreds or thousands spanning your town to millions or billions
spanning the globe.
* pounce :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:12]

To pounce is to attack suddenly by leaping onto your prey. A tiger
will slowly sneak up on its prey and then suddenly pounce, using speed
as much as strength to make the kill.

Of all the animals, cats are the best at pouncing. Snakes
strike. Elephants charge. But when an animal leaps onto its prey,
that's pouncing. When we talk about how people pounce, however, we're
usually talking more figuratively. When we say that a person pounced
on another person, we mean that they attacked viciously without
warning — usually giving the victim no time to defend
themselves. Lawyers pounce on witnesses, for example. If you feel
suddenly ganged-up on, you might feel pounced upon.

Savings without a spending goal gives you options and flexibility, the
ability to wait and the opportunity to pounce. It gives you time to
think. It lets you change course on your own terms.
* hedge :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:13]

A hedge is a living fence made of closely planted bushes, which, as
they grow and get trimmed and shaped, form a wall of green.

Hedge can also be used as a verb. If someone asks you a question and
you hedge, you're avoiding a straight answer. If you're not sure what
your boss's political views are, you can hedge by not revealing
yours. If you hedge your bets, you're trying to minimize risk or loss
— that is, you're trying to cover yourself no matter what happens.

Only saving for a specific goal makes sense in a predictable
world. But ours isn’t. Saving is a hedge against life’s inevitable
ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment.
* propensity :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:14]

A propensity is a natural tendency to behave in a certain way. We all
have propensities — things we tend to do. Dogs have a propensity to
bark, and many people have a propensity for getting annoyed by it.

If you have a propensity for something, then it's something that comes
naturally to you or something you just do a lot. Some people have a
propensity to laugh. Other people have a propensity for making others
laugh, or for being generous, or for getting angry. It's hard to
change your propensities. Sometimes a propensity is a bad thing, as in
a criminal with a propensity for theft or murder.

People with enduring personal finance success—not necessarily those
with high incomes—tend to have a propensity to not give a damn what
others think about them.
* bloat :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:16]

Both as a noun and a verb, bloat refers to being swollen, puffed up,
or overfilled. You can bloat something by filling it up to the point
where it swells.

You use bloat to make the point that something is more than just fat
or large — it's too puffed up or swollen and seems like it might
burst. Most often you'll see bloat used to describe things that are
filled up with liquid or gas — as in that feeling you get after eating
too much. But you might also see the meaning extended to include
things like budgets, egos, and expensive shoe collections. Anytime
someone has way too much of something, you might see bloat used to
describe the situation.

There are professional investors who grind 80 hours a week to add a
tenth of a percentage point to their returns when there are two or
three full percentage points of lifestyle bloat in their finances that
can be exploited with less effort.
* insolvency :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:18]

Insolvency is when someone is completely out of money. A company's
insolvency means that it isn't able to pay its workers and may have to
go out of business.

A family's insolvency is a frightening thing — it might result in the
loss of their home, for example, since they can't afford to pay their
bills. The noun insolvency is more often used to describe the
financial troubles of a business or other organization. If your tennis
club faces insolvency, it may need to seek help from investors or
close altogether. The adjective insolvent means "unable to pay one's
debts," combining the roots in, "not," and solventem, "paying."

The world is filled with people who look modest but are actually
wealthy and people who look rich who live at the razor’s edge of
insolvency. Keep this in mind when quickly judging others’ success and
setting your own goals.
* ingrained :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:19]

Use the adjective ingrained to describe the strong beliefs of someone
who has thought that way for a very long time, such as the ingrained
patriotism of a 20-year military veteran.

Ingrained comes from the word grain, which in late Middle English
referred to a certain kind of dye. This type of dye was indelible —
unable to be removed — much like ingrained beliefs that are so firmly
fixed that they'll never change.

The danger here is that I think most people, deep down, want to be
wealthy. They want freedom and flexibility, which is what financial
assets not yet spent can give you. But it is so ingrained in us that
to have money is to spend money that we don’t get to see the restraint
it takes to actually be wealthy. And since we can’t see it, it’s hard
to learn about it.
* restraint :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:20]

Restraint is the act of holding something back. For example, if you
exercise restraint over your emotions, you won't burst out into tears
in public.

As you may have guessed from its similar spelling, the word restraint
comes from the verb restrain, which in turn comes from the Latin word
restringere, meaning "draw back tightly, confine, check." When talking
about an object, a restraint is a device used to maintain control of
something. For example, if your leg is operated on, the doctors will
use a restraint to hold it still.

The danger here is that I think most people, deep down, want to be
wealthy. They want freedom and flexibility, which is what financial
assets not yet spent can give you. But it is so ingrained in us that
to have money is to spend money that we don’t get to see the restraint
it takes to actually be wealthy. And since we can’t see it, it’s hard

Diet and exercise offer a useful analogy. Losing weight is notoriously
hard, even among those putting in the work of vigorous exercise. In
his book The Body, Bill Bryson explains why:

Modern capitalism makes helping people fake it until they make it a
cherished industry.
* morsel :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:22]

A morsel is a small amount of something, a tid-bit, a sliver, usually
of something of high-quality and much desired — like a morsel of dark
chocolate or a morsel of secret information.

Originally it referred specifically to food — a nineteenth century
lady might partake of a "dainty morsel" to eat, for example. More
often than not morsel now refers to non-food items: a morsel of good
taste; a morsel of common sense, and, of course, most popular of all,
a morsel of gossip. That's why, like all good food, all good gossip is
juicy.

“What happened to your Porsche?” I asked. It was repossessed after
defaulting on his car loan, he said. There was not a morsel of shame.
* assumption                                                          :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:22]

An assumption is something that you assume to be the case, even
without proof. For example, people might make the assumption that
you're a nerd if you wear glasses, even though that's not true. Or
very nice.

From the Latin assumptionem, meaning “a taking or receiving,”
assumption was recorded circa 1300 as a noun describing “the reception
of the Virgin Mary into heaven.” The word later shook its religious
roots and developed into the noun we hear more often today, usually
when a person takes something for granted or literally takes
possession of something.

I remember a fellow we’ll call Roger. He was about my age. I had no
idea what Roger did. But he drove a Porsche, which was enough for
people to draw assumptions.
* gawk :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:23]

When you stare in amazement at something, you gawk at it. You might
stand frozen in one position with your mouth and eyes wide open and
gawk when you see a famous movie star on the street.

The verb gawk was first recorded in American English in 1785. It may
have evolved from the word gaw, which came from the Middle English
word gowen, meaning "to stare." When you gawk at something, you get
completely absorbed in what you're looking at. It's usually not
considered polite behavior to gawk at another person, especially if
it's someone you find attractive. After all, staring is rude.

I learned that as a valet, when I began thinking about all the people
driving up to the hotel in their Ferraris, watching me gawk.
* diminish                                                            :Money:
[2021-04-14 Wed 13:24]

If you drive through a tunnel, you’ll notice that your cell phone
reception is diminished. When something is diminished, it’s been
weakened or lessened.

Diminished is an adjective used when something has lost its power,
prestige, or worth. The value of a car, for instance, is diminished
over time by wear and tear. In some instances, diminished means
"belittled," or made to seem like less in the face of something
perceived as better or greater. The popularity of a laptop, for
instance, will be diminished if a cheaper, more powerful model is
released.  Leaders and politicians who get involved in scandals often
suffer diminished reputations.

Compared to generations prior, control over your time has diminished.

* obtain :Money:
[2021-04-16 Fri 05:32]

Obtain means to get something that is not so easy to come by such as
knowledge, rights, or a large amount of money. You wouldn't say you
obtained a pair of pants, unless they were one of a kind.

At times in its history, obtain has meant to be victorious or to
succeed. Today, it mostly means to acquire, but keeping its prior
meanings in mind helps you to use it in the right way. College degrees
are something that you obtain as is permission from your parents to go
to a party. When you obtain something, you have worked hard to get it,
so you are pretty happy to have it.

I spook very easily these days, and am not ashamed to admit it. He
never spooked at anything. Never.
* preconception                                                    :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 10:55]

A preconception is an idea or opinion you have about something before
you really know much about it. You might have the preconception that
all New Yorkers are rude until you visit the city and start meeting
friendly people.

Imagine you give your friend an assessment of a popular TV show,
saying, "Oh, it's so boring!" despite the fact that you've never seen
it. Your negative opinion of the show is a preconception — you may be
correct about the show, but you won't know until you actually sit down
a watch a few episodes. Preconception comes from pre, "before," and
the Latin concipere, "to take in and hold."

In fact, it can be especially useful to study other species because we
have fewer preconceptions about them. Think of it as a “training
wheels” exercise, if you will.
* TODO whop                                                        :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 10:56]

Gelada baboons, for example, devote a whopping 17 percent of their
daylight hours to grooming each other.
* facilitate                                                       :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 10:56]

To facilitate means to make something easier. If your best friend is
very shy, you could facilitate her efforts to meet new people.

Facilitate comes from the Latin facilis, for "easy." It means to make
something easier or more likely to happen. You facilitate growth or a
process, as opposed to, say, dinner.  Often in business meetings
someone will be assigned to facilitate a discussion so people don't
just sit in awkward silence. Synonyms are ease, simplify, expedite,
and assist.

And thus there can be an incentive for each party to deceive the
other, which may be facilitated by a bit of self-deception.
* misconstrue :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 10:57]

To misconstrue is to get the wrong idea about something. If you
misconstrue a friend’s silence, you might get mad at him for ignoring
you — until you find out he has a sore throat and can’t talk.

The verb misconstrue comes from mis- meaning "wrong" and construe
meaning "construction." Combined they mean "to put a wrong
construction on" — in other words, to interpret in the wrong
way. Sometimes people can intentionally allow others to misconstrue
something for personal gain. For example, a politician may let voters
misconstrue her voting record if she believes doing so will help her
get elected.

To find out why we often misconstrue animal motives, including our
own, we have to look more carefully at how our brains were designed
and what problems they’re intended to solve. We have to turn, in other
words, to evolution.
* TODO hind                                                        :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 10:57]

Humans are a peculiar species. We’re relatively hairless, we walk on
our hind legs, we dance and sing like nobody’s business. We laugh,
blush, and shed tears.
* vain :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 10:57]

If you spend all day admiring yourself in reflective surfaces —
mirrors, pools of water, the backs of spoons — people may think you
are conceited, or vain.

Vain is from Latin vanus, "empty," and in English it originally meant
"lacking value or effect, futile," like your vain attempt to find a
pencil in your messy, overstuffed backpack. Likewise, the phrase "in
vain" means "without success." Vain also means "conceited, too proud
of oneself."  Carly Simon's line "You're so vain, you probably think
this song is about you" is an excellent illustration of this use.

This much is common sense. But in addition to biases in the evidence
itself, we are also biased in the way we approach it. In this respect,
we’re not so much drunk as we are vain; we want our species to be seen
in the most flattering light.
* TODO spur                                                        :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 10:58]

We also endorse competition in service of broader cooperative
activities from which we all stand to gain, like when firms compete in
the marketplace, driving down costs and spurring innovation.
* infer :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 10:58]

When you infer something, you read between the lines. To infer is to
make a well informed guess — if you see your mom’s bag on the table,
you might infer that she’s home.

When you infer, you listen closely to someone and guess at things they
mean but haven't actually said. It’s like guessing, but not making
wild guesses. You're making deductions — guesses based on
logic. Another kind of inferring is more scientific, like when a
scientist has part of a dinosaur fossil and can infer what the rest of
the dinosaur looked like. When you see the word infer, think "educated
guess."

Yes. And so we can reasonably infer that an open field isn’t the
redwood’s native environment.
* TODO ridley                                                      :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 10:58]

“The way the brains of human beings have gotten bigger at an
accelerating pace,” writes Matt Ridley in his book on evolutionary
biology, The Red Queen, “implies that some such within-species arms
race is at work.”
* malevolent :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 10:59]

If someone is malevolent, they wish evil on others. If you find
yourself approaching someone with a malevolent look in her eye, best
to run the other way.

Malevolent comes from the Latin word malevolens, which means
"ill-disposed, spiteful"; its opposite is benevolent, which means
"wishing good things for others."  A malevolent person might display
satisfaction at someone else's problems. But it's not only individuals
who can be malevolent. If you think that television violence
influences viewers to violence, you see television as a malevolent
force. The stress is on the second syllable: muh-LEV-uh-lent.

In an influential 1990 article on language evolution, they write:
“Interacting with an organism of approximately equal mental abilities
whose motives are at times outright malevolent makes formidable and
ever-escalating demands on cognition.”
* lump :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 10:59]

If it's hard to determine its shape and otherwise looks like a big
blob of something, it's probably safe to call it a lump.

Jabba the Hut looks like a disgusting lump. So does the growing mound
on your noggin where you walked into the glass door. And if you've
been lumped together with a bad bunch, you might have been grouped
with people indiscriminately. But all lumps aren't bad. Little old
ladies put lumps of sugar into their tea. And that choked up feeling
you get during a sappy movie? That's just a lump in your throat.

But here (and throughout the book), we’re mostly going to be glossing
over such differences. To motivate our choice to lump men and women
together, consider that when a species is pair-bonded and monogamous,
the incentives for males and females converge.
* courtship :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:00]

A courtship is a period in a romantic couple's relationship when they
are dating. Most partners go through a courtship before deciding to
get married.

Courtship is an old-fashioned word, assuming that two people who love
each other will eventually get married. If your uncle and aunt only
met a few weeks before their wedding, you can say they had a brief
courtship — and if you have friends who aren't married but have been
together for years, you could describe their decades-long
courtship. The word is indeed old-fashioned, from the 16th century
when it meant "paying court to a woman with intention of marriage."

As Geoffrey Miller argues in The Mating Mind, “Our minds evolved not
just as survival machines, but as courtship machines,” and many of our
most distinctive behaviors serve reproductive rather than survival
ends.
* vicious :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:00]

Vicious is an adjective that means intentionally harmful or nasty. If
you spread vicious rumors about a person, you're telling people things
that will hurt her feelings or ruin her reputation. Cut it out!

If you're described as vicious, you're someone who does brutal things
on purpose, out of ill-will towards others, like beating up
defenseless puppies or poisoning the drinking water for a town. You're
worse than just mean if you are vicious — in fact, you're evil! People
(and puppies) will be wise to keep their distance. Other things, like
gossip, animals, or cars from horror movies can be vicious, too.

Dominance is clearly the result of competition, which can often be
vicious and destructive. It’s all about strength and power, the
ability to control others through force.
* vapid :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:00]

Reserve the adjective vapid for the airhead in your office who brings
nothing to the table, except maybe the doughnuts. Vapid is an
adjective to describe someone or something that is dull or
uninspiring.

"We prefer not to consider the shockingly vapid and primitive comments
uttered by athletes in postcontest interviews," David Foster Wallace
wrote. The word was originally used in English in a much more literal
sense, describing beverages that lacked flavor. It comes from the
Latin word vapidus, literally "having exhaled its vapor."

In this regard, prestige is like a popularity contest, similar to the
kind found in high schools around the world (only perhaps not quite as
vapid). We earn prestige not just by being rich, beautiful, and good
at sports, but also by being funny, artistic, smart, well-spoken,
charming, and kind.
* yesteryear :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:00]

Yesteryear is an extremely poetic way to refer to the past. You might
nostalgically talk about the town where you used to live as your home
of yesteryear.

The word yesteryear was actually invented by a poet, Dante Gabriel
Rossetti, in 1870. Rossetti was searching for an accurate way to
translate a phrase by the French poet Francois Villon — the line he
came up with was "But where are the snows of yesteryear?" Other
translators have substituted yore for yesteryear, but the latter is a
word that perfectly captures a kind of nostalgia for a lost past.

Similarly, even the poorest members of today’s world are richer, by
many material standards, than the kings and queens of yesteryear—and
yet they remain at the bottom of the prestige ladder.
* pang                                                             :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:01]

A pang is a sharp jab or an intense hurt that comes on suddenly. If
you've felt an all-of-a-sudden, deep sadness that seems to hit you
even in the back of the eyes, you've probably had a pang of emotion
over a loss or a tragic story.

You can feel a physical pain or pang right when you get hurt, or you
might suffer a pang of guilt that keeps popping up if you don't own up
to something bad. Pang sounds close to pain, and it is pain, but it
has a sharper edge — it's intense and comes on fast. A childbirth pain
often is called a pang, because it's such a unique type of
hurting. Having a pang of regret can be almost as sharp.

But the prestige-seeking itself is more nearly a zero-sum game, which
helps explain why we sometimes feel pangs of envy at even a close
friend’s success.
* savvy :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:01]

You are known as someone with a lot of business savvy, but only
because you've managed to keep your staggering debts a secret. Which
is actually pretty savvy. Someone who is savvy is shrewd and
perceptive.

Most English words stem directly from other European languages, like
French and Latin.  Not savvy.  It comes from the West Indies, a twist
on the French savez vous? — “Do you know?”  Savvy was first recorded
in its adjective form in 1905. Synonyms for the noun form include
acumen, discernment, grasp, perception, and sharpness.

You need the ability to identify, attract, and retain good allies, and
you need to be savvy enough to navigate the tumult as coalitions form,
dissolve, and clash all around you.
* dwarf :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:02]

An unusually short, small person is sometimes called a dwarf. There
are many different genetic medical conditions that can cause a person
to be classified as a little person or a dwarf.

Some people are offended by dwarf, preferring to be called "little
people," "LP," or "people of short stature." The general condition
that leads to delayed growth is called "dwarfism." The noun dwarf is
also used for an unusually small animal or plant, or as a verb meaning
"make something seem very small," as when a new apartment building
dwarfs the surrounding houses. The Old English root dweorg referred to
a tiny creature from German mythology.

But we know of no species more political than our own. Just as human
brains dwarf those of other species, both in size and in complexity,
so too do our coalitions. These take many forms and go by many names.
* clique                                                           :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:02]

A clique is an exclusive group of people or friends. Before Rudolph
pulled Santa's sled through the fog, the clique of flying reindeer
never let him play their reindeer games.

In high school, the exclusive nature of cliques causes a lot of hurt
feelings. Clique carries this less than nice feeling with it wherever
it goes, whether it be a set of elites who surround a government
official, a group of popular kids who don't let others join their
group or the closed circle of people at the office who always make
sure they get the best jobs.

In government, coalitions appear as interest groups and political
parties; in business, they are teams, companies, guilds, and trade
associations. In high school, coalitions are called cliques or
friends. On the street and in prison, they’re called gangs.
* anguish :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:02]

The noun anguish refers to severe physical or emotional pain or
distress. A trip to the dentist might cause a cavity-prone person a
lot of anguish.

We get this word from a Latin word, angustus, which literally meant
"narrow" but developed the figurative sense of "distressed" — think of
being choked off or forced into a small space. In modern times anguish
has been in the English with the parallel and related meanings of
"physical torment" and "emotional suffering." Both kinds might be
experienced at the hands of a dentist who likes to make his patients
squirm in agony.

Whenever we anguish over the guest list for a party, we’re playing
politics.
* astute :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:03]

Someone who is astute is clever and has good judgment. The kid running
around with a bucket stuck on his head? Not so astute.

Astute (from Latin) is a formal and flattering adjective for someone
with a good head on their shoulders. It differs from its synonym
shrewd in placing less emphasis on hardheadedness than on sensitivity:
we talk about a shrewd bargainer but an astute interpretation. Other
synonyms are perceptive (emphasizing insight) and discerning
(emphasizing an ability to distinguish).

This was an argument made by one of Niccolò Machiavelli’s lesser-known
but equally astute contemporaries, Baldassare Castiglione.
* TODO overtly                                                     :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:03]

It’s important to note, however, that although Castiglione’s methods
are less overtly competitive, they nevertheless stem from similar
incentives.
* setback :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:03]

A setback is an event that makes you lose progress or keeps you from
gaining ground. If you're knitting a sweater, dropping a bunch of
stitches would be a big setback.

If warring countries are negotiating a treaty, a sudden resurgence of
fighting would be a huge setback for their peace plan. And if you're
trying to finish baking in time for you friend's birthday party,
knocking the frosted cake onto the floor would also be a
setback. Setbacks are always frustrating — unless you're talking about
the kind of setback that's defined as "a building's distance from the
street."

Not every courtier can be the king’s favorite; one man’s fortune is
his rival’s setback.
* clout :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:04]

When you speak of someone having clout, it usually means that they
communicate a sense of power or influence, particularly in the
political sense. "You’ll wanna talk to that big guy over there if you
want me to let you in. He’s got clout."

Clout can also mean to hit someone really hard — either the hit you
give (“that’s a big clout he just landed”) or the act of hitting (“she
clouted him with a baseball bat”). Of course, the sense of having
power and the actual hitting are related, since clout is something to
be wielded — either physically or figuratively. Note: it's not just
tough guys who have clout. China is said to have "growing economic
clout," and Oprah is known to have significant clout in the media
industry.

To succeed in the mating game, for example, it often pays to have high
status and political clout—while an attractive mate can, in turn,
raise one’s social status.
* unfettered                                                       :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:05]

The adjective unfettered describes something or someone uninhibited
and unrestrained. If you write mysteries novels for a living you
probably turn your unfettered imagination to murder and mayhem.

Unfettered comes from the Old English root word fetor, which was a
chain or shackle for the feet. Un- means "not," so originally the word
literally meant "not chained or shackled." Today there isn't much real
shackling going on, so the adjective unfettered mainly describes
something that is free or unrestrained. You'll see such uses as
unfettered emotions, unfettered stock market growth, and unfettered
speech.

The three games also share some important structural similarities. As
we’ve mentioned, they’re all competitive games where not everyone can
win, and where unfettered competition has the potential to get nasty.
* mediated :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:05]

When you argue with your friend and your disagreement is mediated,
that means a neutral person has stepped in to help the two of you
negotiate or come to an agreement.

Two kids fighting on a playground might need their dispute to be
mediated by a calm grownup. Unfortunately, many of the fights that
need to be mediated are between leaders of countries or feuding groups
of fully grown adults. The Latin root of mediated is medius, or
"middle," which makes a lot of sense when you imagine a referee
standing in the middle of two angry soccer teams.

Both of these tasks—judging and being judged—are mediated by signals.
* mutt :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:06]

A mutt is any dog that's a combination of different breeds, rather
than one identifiable breed. Your beloved mutt might be as big as a
Golden Retriever but with short, Corgi-like legs.

Most dogs are mutts, and many of their owners are fine with the word
mutt, despite the word's original implication of "inferior, mixed
breed dog." Dogs called crossbreeds are deliberately bred to combine
characteristics of two or more recognized breeds, while mutts — also
known as mongrels — are the result of accidental mixing of breeds. In
the late 1800s, mutt was a derogatory term meaning either "stupid
person" or "stupid dog."

A signal, in evolutionary biology, is anything used to communicate or
convey information. Unblemished skin or fur, for example, is a signal
of a healthy organism; compare a prize-winning beagle to a mangy mutt.
* mangy :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:06]

Imagine something really disgusting — crusty, dirty, falling apart —
you know, like zombie flesh. If it’s shoddy, gross, and really, really
cruddy, it can be called mangy.

If you want a really insulting adjective, you can’t do better than the
word mangy. A mangy dog has a skin disease carried by mites that
causes the animal to lose its hair and develop crusty patches on its
body. Or, if you own a mangy sweater, it is probably threadbare and
stained. As you can imagine, you should probably think twice before
calling a person mangy!

A signal, in evolutionary biology, is anything used to communicate or
convey information. Unblemished skin or fur, for example, is a signal
of a healthy organism; compare a prize-winning beagle to a mangy mutt.
* dictum :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:06]

"You are what you eat" is a dictum, and so is a law requiring you to
curb your dog. A dictum is a formal pronouncement, a rule, or a
statement that expresses a truth universally acknowledged.

Dictum dates from the 16th Century. It descended from a Latin word
that means "something said." In contemporary use, it means more like
"something that is officially said." If the principal of your school
issues a dictum declaring "no jeans in school," it's time to go
shopping.

In the human social realm, honest signaling and the handicap principle
are best reflected in the dictum, “Actions speak louder than words.”
* whittle :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:06]

To whittle is to pare or carve away. Wood carvers whittle pieces of
wood, removing bit by bit until what's left is a sailor with a yellow
raincoat or a lone wolf howling at the moon.

Whittle can also mean to reduce an amount or number of items. In this
sense, it is commonly paired with the words away or down. A courtroom
attorney might "whittle away" at a defendant's alibi until the truth
emerges. You might "whittle down" a to-do list or "whittle away" at
your student loan debt every month. But only a highly skilled wood
carver can whittle a chunk of pine into that old salty dog with a
yellow raincoat.

We may have evolved an instinct to make art, for example, as a means
of advertising our artistic skills and free time (survival
surplus)—but that’s not necessarily what we’re thinking about as we
whittle a sculpture from a piece of driftwood.
* TODO pinecone                                                    :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:07]

All the energy that they currently waste racing upward, they could
instead invest in other pursuits, like making more pinecones in order
to spread further, perhaps into new territory. Competition, in this
case, holds the entire species back.
* rogue :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:07]

A rogue is a sneaky person who has tricks up his sleeve, not like a
magician, but like someone who would steal your wallet or cheat at
cards.

Dishonesty won’t get you far in life, unless you are a rogue who
survives by lying and exploiting others.  The word comes from the
Latin rogare, which means “beg,” and while some rogues dress like
beggars to get your money, anyone who deceives is a rogue, like the
presidents of corrupt corporations who steal from their employees, or
that rogue Uncle Marvin who promises you chocolate for washing his
car, but afterward tells you he has no chocolate.  That rogue!

This rogue tree would then soak in more energy from the sun, and
thereby outcompete its rivals and leave more descendants, ensuring
that the next generation of redwoods would be even more rivalrous and
competitive—until eventually they were all back to being as tall as
they are today.
* angle                                                            :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:07]

Remember all those pesky geometry classes in high school? Then you'll
remember measuring the angle or space between two intersecting lines
in degrees. If you recall that a right angle measures ninety degrees,
give yourself a bonus.

Angle can also mean a biased way of looking at or presenting
something. Talk radio stations, for example, often discuss current
events with a "political angle." On a far more peaceful note, to angle
also means simply to fish, both in the literal sense of trying to
catch a fish on a hook or in the metaphorical sense of trying to
subtly obtain something without being seen to do so directly, as in,
"I'm going to angle for a promotion at work."

Most of us have been in a situation like this: You’re standing in line
to buy a movie ticket, chatting quietly with a friend and minding your
own business, when a group of strangers casually angles in ahead of
you.
* detriment :Elephant:

Detriment is the hurt or harm as a result of damage, loss, or a bad
decision. The developers won the lawsuit, much to the detriment of the
people who live near the construction site.

The meaning of detriment has not changed much from its roots in the
Latin word, detrimentum, which is "a rubbing off, loss, damage,
defeat." A detriment is a loss that wears you down. Smoking is a
detriment to good health, as is standing in the snow barefooted. To
the detriment of the people who clean the floors, we gave the girls
scrambled eggs right before gymnastics class.

Now, some norms, especially top-down laws, can be oppressive or
extractive and an overall detriment to the societies that enforce
them.

[2021-04-26 Mon 11:08]

Use the adjective notorious to describe people, places, or things that
are famous for a bad reason.

A good synonym for notorious is infamous; both words mean "well-known,
and not in a good way." A celebrity convicted of a series of crimes
might be referred to as notorious, as might a book that has been
banned in several countries. The word originally meant just "famous"
and could carry either positive or negative connotations. Only in
recent centuries did the negative uses start to outweigh the positive
ones. In general, you'd rather be famous than notorious — unless
you're looking to build a bad reputation.

In Debt, the anthropologist David Graeber tells the story of Tei
Reinga, a Maori villager and “notorious glutton” who used to wander up
and down the New Zealand coast, badgering the local fishermen by
asking for the best portions of their catch.
* glutton :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:08]

Do you like to eat and drink — I mean, really like to eat and drink?
Then you might be a glutton.

We all have our favorite foods and drinks, but some people are a
little more into it than others — these people are gluttons. Someone
who's a glutton because they just eat too much is different from a
gourmet or gourmand, who enjoys only the best food. This word also is
used in phrases like "glutton for punishment," which you might say
about a student who asks for extra homework.

* flout                                                            :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:08]

To flout is to scorn or show contempt for. "I flout the law and the
concept of civilian safety by making a concerted effort to jaywalk
every time I cross a street."

Oddly enough, when flout came into existence in the 1550s, it had a
much different sense to it than it does now; it's believed that it
evolved from the Middle English flowten, “to play the flute." These
days, the verb flout means "to scorn," as in to scorn a law, person,
or social norm by defying it. As a noun, it is a contemptuous remark
or insult. Wrote William Shakespeare, “Flout 'em, and scout 'em; and
scout 'em and flout 'em; Thought is free.”

This story is extreme, to say the least, but it illustrates how
norm-following and norm-enforcement can be a very high-stakes
game. Reinga flouted an important norm (against freeloading) and
eventually paid dearly for it.
* TODO tellingly                                                   :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:08]

But just as tellingly, the fishermen who put him to death felt so
duty-bound by a different norm (the norm of food-sharing) that they
followed it even to the point of building up murderous resentment.
* indecency :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:09]

Indecency is the habit or action of being offensive or
improper. Indecency is banned on television during times that children
might be watching.

If you tell dirty jokes or deeply offend a friend, you could be
accused of indecency. Swearing on a radio broadcast or showing an
extremely violent scene in a movie meant for kids are both examples of
indecency that are punishable by law. Indecency comes from the Latin
word indecentem, "not decent" or "in bad taste," from the roots in-,
"not," and decentem, "fitting or proper."

When you forget to zip up your fly, for example, no one’s going to
arrest you for public indecency; they’re just going to snicker.
* snicker :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:09]

To snicker is to laugh in a mean or disrespectful way, often
expressing superiority. We might snicker at a bully who walks directly
into a closed door.

You can also use this word's near-synonym, snigger, to describe a
short snort of a laugh or a scornful sound. You know your stand-up
comedy act isn't going well when you don't even get snickers from your
audience. A secondary meaning of snicker is horse-related: to
whinny. It's actually from this use that the Snickers candy bar gets
its name. In 1930, the Mars family named it after their favorite horse
— Snickers.

Most norms, of course, aren’t enforced on pain of death. In general,
the punishment will be tailored to the crime. When you forget to zip
up your fly, for example, no one’s going to arrest you for public
indecency; they’re just going to snicker.
* TODO lashing                                                     :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:09]

Instead of lashing out physically at a transgressor, we might roll our
eyes or flash a disapproving scowl.
* covenant                                                         :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:09]

A covenant is an agreement between two people, or companies, or even
countries. It is formal, solemn, sometimes even sacred.

There are some places where you'll hear covenant get used. It's a
little old fashioned and formal, but marriage is often referred to as
a covenant. The most famous covenant appears in the Bible — God tells
a shepherd named Abraham to follow God's instructions in exchange for
making Abraham's descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky.

But the threat of some kind of punishment must always be present, or a
“norm” is little more than hot air. “Covenants,” says Thomas Hobbes,
“without the sword, are but words.”
* TODO forage                                                      :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:10]

Foraging, also known as hunting and gathering, is the lifestyle our
ancestors practiced until the agricultural revolution starting around
10,000 b.c.
* corroborate                                                      :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:10]

To corroborate is to back someone else’s story. If you swear to your
teacher that you didn't throw the spitball, and your friends
corroborate your story by promising that you were concentrating on
math homework, she might actually believe you.

For example, a witness in court corroborates the testimony of others,
and further experimentation can corroborate a scientific theory. Near
synonyms are substantiate and confirm. Corroborate, originally meaning
"to support or strengthen," was borrowed from Latin corrōborāre,
formed from the prefix cor- "completely" plus rōborāre "to strengthen"
(from rōbur "strength").

Even so, the data about this way of life is consistent enough, and
corroborated by enough archaeological evidence and reasoning, for us
to develop at least a rough sketch of how our ancestors probably
lived.
* prominence :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:10]

Prominence has to do with importance. If a band becomes famous,
they've come into prominence.

Prominence is a type of importance: if you put a statue in the middle
of a room, you're giving it a place of prominence. In movies, music,
and sports, the most successful people have great prominence — they're
prominent or famous. Anything that juts out or sticks out has
prominence. Whether prominence comes from being widely known or just
being hard to miss, you can't really ignore anything or anybody that
has achieved prominence.

Despite its prominence in the public imagination, big-game hunting is
rarely the main source of calories.
* dissenter                                                        :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:11]

A dissenter is someone who disagrees with commonly held opinions or
beliefs. Except for one dissenter (your brother who dislikes amusement
parks), everyone in your family is looking forward to going to
Disneyland next summer.

If the U.S. Supreme Court makes a decision that's supported by eight
of the Justices, the one Justice who disagrees with the ruling is a
dissenter. This word is also used to mean "protester," or someone who
stands up and takes action against a law or policy. In the 17th
century, dissenter was used for someone who disagreed with a religious
belief or doctrine.

Decisions are made by consensus, and dissenters are free to leave the
band.
* tread :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:12]

When you tread on the earth, you walk on it. The next time your pal
thinks you have it too easy, you might ask him, “Why don’t you tread
in my shoes for a day?”

Tread usually implies stepping with force, but it can also simply mean
placing your feet, one after the other, on the ground. You might try
to tread lightly on the moss in the backyard so you don't damage
it. Tread is also a noun that means the mark that a tire leaves on the
ground, or the actual grooves on the tire. You might be relieved that
the tread marks at the crime scene didn't match your brother's truck
after all.

Foragers would readily support the motto of the early American general
Christopher Gadsden: “Don’t tread on me.”
* reprisal :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:12]

A reprisal is an act of retaliation, especially one committed by one
country against another. If you attack your enemy's village and cause
lots of damage, expect a reprisal.

Reprisal comes from the French for taking back, and used to mean the
seizure of property as a compensation for some earlier loss. Now we
use it more in the sense of a retaliatory attack.  When Germany bombed
London during World War II, the British reprisals included the bombing
of Berlin. Reprisal doesn't always have to be about war; you can use
it for any act of retaliation.

The incentives surrounding true norms are more complex. When we do
something “wrong,” we have to worry about reprisal not just from the
wronged party but also from third parties.
* wimpy :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:12]

Someone who's wimpy is extremely ineffective, weak, or fearful. You
might feel wimpy about declining an invitation to jump on your
friend's snowmobile without a helmet, but that's actually a wise
decision.

This informal adjective is a derogatory way to describe a cowardly or
physically frail person. "Don't be such a wimpy kid," your older
sister might say, "go ahead and jump off the high dive!" Most experts
trace wimpy back to the comic strip character J. Wellington
Wimpy. Known simply as Wimpy, he was Popeye's hamburger-loving,
soft-spoken, and slightly cowardly sidekick.

Big strong Albert could easily steal from wimpy Bob without fearing
trouble from Bob himself, but in human groups, Albert would then face
sanctions from the rest of the community.
* projectile :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:12]

A projectile is a type of weapon that is propelled towards its
target. If you fire a cannon, the cannonball is a projectile, but the
cannon itself is not.

When projectile refers to a weapon, it is always propelled by
something else. Think of the bullet in a gun or a spear thrown by a
person. A rocket, which is self-propelled, is also called a
projectile. As an adjective, projectile means "propelled forward" as
in a projectile force or weapon. Sometimes you see the expression,
projectile vomiting, a particularly violent way to throw up.

Another way weapons alter the balance of power applies to projectile
weapons like stones or spears. Such distance weapons make it much
easier for a coalition to gang up on a single individual.
* melee :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:13]

A melee is a noisy free-for-all or rowdy fight — a no holds barred,
battle royal, if you will. It's what pro wrestlers engage in every
night, and shoppers endure at the toy store every holiday season.

If you think melee sounds like a fancy French way to say "crazy bar
brawl," you're right: It comes from the French mêlée which means
"confused fight or mixture.” What makes a melee different than any
other fight is that element of chaos or confusion — so don't jump into
a brewing melee unless you're really ready to bring the ruckus.

And a three-against-one melee still carries a big risk of serious
injury for the attackers, especially if the one they’re attacking is
the strongest of the group.
* curtail                                                          :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:13]

To curtail something is to slow it down, put restrictions on it, or
stop it entirely. If I give up cake, I am curtailing my cake-eating.

Curtail is an official-sounding word for stopping or slowing things
down. The police try to curtail crime — they want there to be less
crime in the world. A company may want to curtail their employees'
computer time, so they spend more time working and less time goofing
around. Teachers try to curtail whispering and note-passing in
class. When something is curtailed, it's either stopped entirely or
stopped quite a bit — it's cut short.

And while it can often be mean-spirited and hurtful, gossip is also an
important process for curtailing bad behavior, especially among
powerful people.
* topple                                                           :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:13]

To topple something is to knock it down. A house of cards can be
toppled — so can a government.

Things can topple in several ways. If a building collapses or falls
down for any reason, it topples. If you knocked over another student,
you toppled that person. Governments that are overthrown are also said
to be toppled. When you see the word topple, someone or something is
going down.

If and when the North Korean regime is eventually toppled, for
example, it will be in large part because citizens whispered in
private about the failings of the “supreme leader.”
* transgressor                                                     :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:14]

You can use the noun transgressor for anyone who violates a rule or
oversteps a boundary. You are being a transgressor, for example, when
you bring your barking dog into the library.

A car thief is one kind of transgressor, a person who is actually
breaking the law. Another kind of transgressor is someone who betrays
an agreement or an unstated rule of behavior, like not wearing full
clown makeup to a non-circus-related job interview. The word
transgressionem is at the root of transgressor, and it means "a
transgression of the law" in Late Latin or "a going over" in classical
Latin.

Standing up to norm violators can be risky, especially when they’re
powerful. It’s rarely in people’s best interests to stick out their
necks to punish transgressors.
* evict :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:14]

Use the verb evict to say that a tenant is being forced to move out of
his home, usually through legal action. If you don't pay your rent,
eventually your landlord will evict you.

Evict became part of the English language back in the 1530s. Based on
the Latin word evincere, meaning "recover property, overcome and
expel, conquer," even then it had a legal process attached to
it. Before you evict someone, you have to complete official paperwork,
though some landlords may succeed in evicting tenants without
following the legal steps.

Someone who helps evict a cheater will be celebrated for her
leadership. Who would you rather team up with: someone who stands by
while rules are flouted, or someone who stands up for what’s right?
* retaliation :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:14]

Retaliation is an act of revenge. Before you initiate retaliation on
someone who has wronged you, consider whether he or she might have a
ninja alter ego and a set of nunchucks stashed away.

The noun retaliation stems from the Latin retaliare, meaning “pay back
in kind.” Notice the word kind in that definition. Retaliation used to
have both good and evil connotations. Now, though, it’s important to
read that kind as synonymous with type or sort because retaliation has
since lost its positive sense. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, “Man
must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge,
aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.”

Kevin’s story illustrates that it’s difficult to enforce norms because
anyone who tries to mete out punishment faces the risk of retaliation.
* fare :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:15]

It's not fair that fare means three unrelated things. As a verb, it
means to proceed or get along, as in "Fare thee well." As a noun, it
can refer to the cost of travel ("Train fare is ten dollars") or to
food ("Tatertots are typical cafeteria fare").

To remember fare's different meanings, think of how, for people living
close to the bone, the question "How are you eating/faring?" is not so
different from "How are you getting along/faring?" And when you pay
plane fare and fly to France, you will most assuredly be eating French
fare once you get there.

But a group may fare just as well by positively rewarding people who
help to punish cheaters.
* unduly :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:15]

If something is done unduly, it's done out of proportion with what's
reasonable or right. If you're unduly treated, you're not treated in
the way you deserve to be.

Duly comes from the late 14th century duweliche meaning "rightly,
properly." The prefix un-, meaning "not" of course reverses that
meaning so with unduly we get "not rightly or properly." You might
become unduly angry with a toddler for tracking mud into the
house. Unduly can also mean "excessively." Worrying unduly about the
future can be paralyzing. Sometimes it's good to take the days as they
come.

By targeting intentions rather than actions, norms can more precisely
regulate the behavior patterns that cause problems within communities.
(It would be ham-fisted and unduly cumbersome to ban friendliness, for
example.)
* toot                                                             :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:15]

Toot is both the act of blowing on a horn and the sound that comes out
when you do. The word is fun to say, a favorite of children pretending
to be cars. It suggests a kind of merry, or at least chipper,
sensibility.

Speaking of merriment, toot can also refer to a night of drinking and
carousing. Light, fun drinking: think 1920s flappers dancing in
fountains, not hardcore alcoholics with bottles in paper bags. It's
the car behind you letting you know the light has changed or the
cheerful sound of a tugboat asking larger ships to make way. Even
"tooting your own horn" is just not that serious — it's a lighthearted
spin on the otherwise obnoxious act of bragging.

Clearly we all enjoy tooting our own horns now and again, and so
bragging (or showing off) is tolerated occasionally and in small
doses.
* bristle :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:16]

A bristle is a stiff hair — the kind men shave off their face or the
kind badgers have all over. Bristle also means to get angry. Tell an
animal rights activist you use a badger's bristle shaving brush and
you'll get the idea.

The emotional meaning of to bristle comes from the fact that most
animal bristles used by man are so-called erectile hairs — the ones
that stand up on the neck or along the back of animal when it's angry
or surprised. A common word associated with bristle is hackle, another
name for such erectile animal hairs. Thus the saying "to get one's
hackles up," which is pretty much identical to bristling.

But in most contexts, we start to bristle when people get too full of
themselves. It’s part of that forager aversion to dominance, since
bragging is a way to increase one’s influence and dominance within a
community.
* TODO babbler                                                     :Elephant:

In humans, just as with the Arabian babbler we encountered in Chapter
1, status comes in two distinct varieties: dominance and prestige.*
malevolent :Elephant: [2021-04-26 Mon 11:17]

If someone is malevolent, they wish evil on others. If you find
yourself approaching someone with a malevolent look in her eye, best
to run the other way.

Malevolent comes from the Latin word malevolens, which means
"ill-disposed, spiteful"; its opposite is benevolent, which means
"wishing good things for others."  A malevolent person might display
satisfaction at someone else's problems. But it's not only individuals
who can be malevolent. If you think that television violence
influences viewers to violence, you see television as a malevolent
force. The stress is on the second syllable: muh-LEV-uh-lent.

“The way the brains of human beings have gotten bigger at an accelerating pace,” writes
Matt Ridley in his book on evolutionary biology, The Red Queen, “implies that some such
within-species arms race is at work.”4 Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom also emphasize
intra-species competition as an evolutionary cause of our intelligence. In an influential
1990 article on language evolution, they write: “Interacting with an organism of
approximately equal mental abilities whose motives are at times outright malevolent
makes formidable and ever-escalating demands on cognition.”5
* TODO twofold                                                     :Elephant:
[2021-04-26 Mon 11:17]

Here the logic is twofold. First, a prestigious beta has shown himself
to be more useful to the group, so the alpha prefers to keep him
around. Second, by performing more acts of “altruism,” a babbler
demonstrates his strength and fitness.
