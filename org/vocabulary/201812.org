* obstinate :satellite:
[2018-12-04 Tue 16:41]

When someone is beyond stubborn, use the word obstinate instead: "You
obstinate old mule! Get out of my way!"

While stubborn may have positive or negative connotations, obstinate
is most definitely negative, because it implies a kind of hard-headed
determination not to change your mind even when it might be best to
rethink your position. "The obstinate Man does not hold Opinions, but
they hold him," wrote Samuel Butler way back in the seventeenth
century. The word still does the trick if you want a put-down for
someone you think is being a pig-headed fool or a stick in the mud.

Kipling and Earhart almost capture the secret to achievement, but we need to qualify
them because they can lead to obstinate persistence either to goals or methods that
aren’t working, and because they ignore or dismiss the emotional component of achieving
goals.
* disengage :satellite:
[2018-12-04 Tue 17:05]

To disengage means to "free or disentangle" yourself or some object
from another person or object. No, it doesn't mean breaking off your
engagement to your beloved — that's "chickening out."

Does your mind wander when someone (your fiancé, for example) talks to
you? Well, your mind can disengage as well, that is, stop paying
attention. Disengage has quite a formal, intellectual ring to it, even
if used about a situation as physical as two armies "disengaging from
combat." It's a technical term, and faintly clinical; the kind of word
frequently used by politicians and diplomats.

Then, about two years ago, my bestie, Josh Wateskin, recognizing that I couldn’t unwind
or disengage from my relentless analyzing of the world – especially the financial world
– recommended that I take up meditation.
* relinquish :satellite:
[2018-12-04 Tue 17:07]

If you relinquish something, you let it go. You relinquish control of
the army when you resign as general. You relinquish your plan to sneak
into town when your parents find out what's going on.

Relinquish is also commonly used to mean physically letting go of
something: The monkey wouldn't relinquish its grasp on the banana.
Relinquish descends from Latin relinquere, from the prefix re- "again"
plus linquere "to leave."

But, I eventually
reframed meditation as a way to relinquish control of my conscious mind so that my more
powerful unconscious mind could take over, and my analysis of the world would improve.
* beckons :satellite:
[2018-12-04 Tue 17:21]

To beckon is to use a physical gesture to call someone over to you.
Universally recognized gestures used to beckon include crooking the
finger or nodding the head to invite someone over.

We get the word beckon from the Old English gebecnian, meaning "to
make a mute sign," which comes from bēacen, meaning "a sign or
beacon." (Remember that "beacon" is a noun while beckon is a verb).
When you beckon to someone, you give them a physical sign to "come
here." Figuratively, an ice cream sundae might beckon you, calling you
away from your diet.

Almost always, the answer is,
“My mission,” which is like a beacon that always beckons.
* beacon :satellite:
[2018-12-04 Tue 17:22]

If your nose is shining like a beacon, I hope you are a reindeer
employed by a jolly fat man from the North Pole.

Beacon comes from an Old English word meaning “sign,” and that's what
actual beacons are for lost ships: signs of having made it to land.
Beacons are often some kind of light, like the bonfires that the
ancient Greeks lit on hillsides to communicate that an army had come
home from overseas. You'll also see beacon used figuratively,
especially in the phrase “beacon of hope.”

Almost always, the answer is,
“My mission,” which is like a beacon that always beckons.
* inherent :satellite:
[2018-12-04 Tue 17:25]

Use the adjective inherent for qualities that are considered permanent
or cannot be separated from an essential character.

We use the adjective inherent to describe attributes that are part of
the essential nature of something. It's different from you being tall,
rather than being a description, it has to be a quality and this
quality is unchangeable. So, for example, if you have never been able
to eat spinach, you have an inherent dislike of it.

It’s especially
hard for me because of my inherent optimism and my unflagging enthusiasm, and because I
always lean into each moment and every encounter expecting magic or miracles, and
because life has rewarded me increasingly with tantalizing offers.
* pursuits :satellite:
[2018-12-04 Tue 18:51]

A pursuit is a chase or a quest for something. When a guard runs after
an escaping jewel thief, she's in pursuit — while the thief may have
stolen the jewels because he was in pursuit of wealth.

Whether it's a police officer in a car chase or a student working
towards a college degree at a university in the tropics, both can be
considered in “hot pursuit.”  Derived from the Anglo-French purseute,
pursuit means the act of pursuing or striving towards goals. In the
late 14th century it implied persecution, but things have changed
since then.

Keep in mind that the time spent on pursuits not related to your mission is time that
could’ve been spent on it – not that all your time, of course, should be devoted to your
mission.
* ambushing :satellite:
[2018-12-04 Tue 18:55]

An ambush is a sneak attack. To ambush your enemy, hide and wait for
him to come near and then pounce on him.

In war or in backyards, an ambush is a great way to surprise someone.
Ambush comes from a Latin word meaning “to place in a wood,” and
hiding in the woods behind a tree is a classic starting point for an
ambush. The actual attack is called an ambush, but ambush is also a
verb, so you can ambush your mom by dropping water balloons on her
head from a tree. Please don’t tell her where you got that idea.

I get endless delight covertly ambushing unsuspecting strangers with
random acts of kindness.
* comprised :satellite:
[2018-12-06 Thu 00:44]

When something comprises other things, it is made up of them or formed
from them. The periodic table comprises 118 elements, because the
whole comprises the parts.

In its traditional use, the word comprise is the opposite of compose:
if A comprises X, Y, and Z, then X, Y, and Z compose A. But because
compose and comprise sound so much alike, people have long confused
the two. So now you often hear things like "The band is comprised of a
guitarist, a bassist, and a hairy drummer," whereas sticklers would
prefer "is composed of" in that sentence. The word is undergoing a
usage shift, making it just as hairy as that drummer!

In order to write a personal mission statement, we must begin at the
very center of our Circle of Influence, that center comprised of our
most basic paradigms, the lens through which we see the world.
* fickle :satellite:
[2018-12-06 Thu 01:28]

People who are fickle change their minds so much you can't rely on
them. If your best friend suddenly decides that she doesn't like you
one week, and then the next week she wants to hang out again, she's
being fickle.

Fickle comes from the Old English word ficol, for deceitful. We
usually use fickle to talk about people, but it can also be used for
abstract things that alternately favor you and abuse you, like the
weather. If you win the lottery and then lose everything else in the
world that's important to you, fate is being fickle.

Your security lies somewhere on the continuum between extreme
insecurity on one end, wherein your life is buffeted by all the
fickle forces that play upon it, and a deep sense of high intrinsic
worth and personal security on the other end.

* accolades :satellite:
[2018-12-11 Tue 21:56]

A knight being honored with the tap of a sword-blade was the earliest
form of accolade. Today, an accolade is more than a way to bestow
knighthood, it is a form of praise or an award.

In the early 17th century, the French accoler meant to "embrace the
neck," which was done as part of a knighthood ceremony. By the 19th
century, accolade came to mean "award." A person who achieves a goal
in research or service may receive an official paper certificate or
trophy, an accolade of achievement, while a performer or speaker might
get an accolade in the form of applause from the audience. Rarely does
either of these types of accolade involve a sword.

Or that we
need certain things (like accolades, nominations,
invitations, etc.)
* hoe :satellite:
[2018-12-13 Thu 18:13]

A hoe is a gardening tool made up of a long handle with a sharp metal
blade at the end, used to stab the ground and loosen it.

Hoe can be a noun or a verb, so you can use your hoe to remove weeds
from a lawn, or you can hoe your garden and make it ready to plant.
The word shares the same root as hew, which is a verb that means "to
strike, chop, or cut." The “oe” seems tricky, but remember that it
never changes, and even if you’re hoeing with three hoes in grass you
hoed yesterday, the hoe stays the same.

2 You may think one is more of a hoe than another who goes
 after a matatu driver/conductor but more likely, you will
 find that even that other one has an assessment criteria
 for all suitors and potential suitors in her life factored
 into her decision making process.
* stoke :satellite:
[2018-12-13 Thu 21:06]

To stoke is to poke a fire and fuel it so that it burns higher. Stoke
can also mean "incite" — a principal's impassive silence in the face
of requests for more tater tots might stoke the flames of student
anger.

When a surfer says, "I am so stoked," it means she is excited — the
fire of enthusiasm is burning hotter. It's interesting to reflect on
how many words in our language have to do with the tending of fires,
an activity that has become much less common in recent human history.

When he was a young boy, he would use the verbal and
physical abuse he suffered at the hands of his father to
stoke the fires in him for achievement.
* seamless :satellite:
[2018-12-16 Sun 13:55]

Something seamless could literally be a piece of clothing without
seams, but it's usually something else that's smooth or unbroken, like
a seamless transition.

Seamless things are connected so well that you can't see what's
holding them together. They're flowing, consistent, and
well-put-together. If an employee leaves, and the replacement does a
great job immediately, that's a seamless transition. In basketball, if
a team goes from offense to defense without missing a beat, that's
seamless play. And that underwear that seems to be made out of one
piece of material? Seamless. And super comfortable.

Containerization makes CI/CD seamless.
* fraught :satellite:
[2018-12-20 Thu 19:44]

Fraught means filled with something — often something bad. Your
Thanksgiving was fraught with awkward moments when your family saw
your blue hair, and it only got worse when you told them you'd quit
law school to join the circus.

Fraught is related to the word freight, and comes from the Middle
English fraughten, meaning "to load with cargo." Think of a cargo ship
loaded up with freight for a journey — it's full of supplies, just
like Thanksgiving was filled with — or fraught with — awkward moments.
Fraught can also describe a situation filled with distress. If
relations between two countries are fraught, they are not getting
along with each other.

They
are actually incredibly difficult and fraught with failure.
* impinge :satellite:
[2018-12-26 Wed 18:09]

Whether you have a habit of standing too close when talking to others
or bringing luggage on a crowded rush-hour subway car, you'll find
people don't like it when you impinge on their personal space.

When you impinge, you intrude on something, whether it’s someone
else’s space, time, or rights. Think of it as moving in on someone’s
territory. The word also can be used in the sense of affecting
something, usually negatively, often by restricting it. For example,
constantly inviting your friend to go shopping and meet you in nice
restaurants might impinge on her desire to save money.

We become
vulnerable to the moods and feelings, the behavior and treatment of
our spouse, or to any external event that may impinge on the
relationship—a new child, in-laws, economic setbacks, social
successes, and so forth.
* resort :satellite:
[2018-12-26 Wed 18:12]

The noun resort means "turning to something or someone else for
assistance." You tried everything to figure out your math homework on
your own, so asking your dad for help was your last resort.

Resort, pronounced "re-ZORT," is also a verb that means "to adopt a
course of action to improve your situation." It's when you use that
last resort: if you can't convince your mom to let you go
rock-climbing, you will resort to begging. Resort also means a fancy
hotel, usually in a very scenic location, or a place you go often —
when your friends didn't know where you were, they checked your
resorts: the gym and the park.

So we resort to sarcasm, cutting
humor, criticism—anything that will keep from exposing the tenderness
within.
* accusations :satellite:
[2018-12-26 Wed 18:14]

When you say someone is guilty of doing something wrong you make an
accusation, like your accusation that your brother used your computer
without asking first.

Accusation comes from the verb accuse, which means to charge someone
with a crime. It is important to remember that an accusation comes
about when someone thinks another person has done something wrong or
committed a crime. It doesn't mean, however, that the person is
guilty. There needs to be proof — an investigation or trial, even
admission of guilt — before a conviction, meaning the person really is
guilty.

Each partner tends to wait on the initiative of the other for
love, only to be disappointed but also confirmed as to the rightness
of the accusations made.
* anxious :satellite:
[2018-12-26 Wed 18:19]

When you are anxious, you are very concerned or worried, but it can
also refer to when you are quite interested in something. You might be
anxious to improve your performance in math class after falling asleep
during a big test.

The word anxious has generally been used to describe when someone is
very concerned about something. In medical terms, to be anxious means
feeling uneasy and worried but not always with a specific focus. On
the other hand, being anxious can also mean that you are very eager.
One meaning is negative and the other is positive!

Since many factors affect
these economic foundations, I become anxious and uneasy, protective
and defensive, about anything that may affect them.
* prevent :satellite:
[2019-01-04 Fri 20:01]

The verb prevent means "to keep something from happening," like when
you use a complicated password to prevent hackers from accessing your
account.

Prevent comes from the Latin word praeventus, meaning "to act in
anticipation of," like when you shovel the icy, snow-covered sidewalk
to prevent people from falling. Prevent can also mean "to make
impossible," like when a school locks the doors during a dance to
prevent kids from leaving without their parents knowing.

Because their identity and sense of self-worth are wrapped up in
their work, their security is vulnerable to anything that happens to
prevent them from continuing in it.
* tangible :satellite:
[2019-01-04 Fri 20:16]

When you can touch something, it's tangible: "I need tangible proof
that aliens exist — I want to shake their little green hands!"

Tangible is from Latin tangere "to touch," and it simply means
something that can be touched or felt, though it can be used in
metaphorical senses: "tangible assets" have a value that can be
precisely measured, and "tangible grief" can be clearly sensed by an
onlooker. So you might not need to physically touch something for it
to be tangible, but it has to be grounded in the real world of facts:
"Has the teen pop star demonstrated any tangible ability to sing?"

A driving force of many
people is possessions—not only tangible, material
possessions such as fashionable clothes, homes, cars,
boats, and jewelry, but also the intangible
possessions of fame, glory, or social prominence.
* prominence :satellite:
[2019-01-04 Fri 20:17]

Prominence has to do with importance. If a band becomes famous,
they've come into prominence.

Prominence is a type of importance: if you put a statue in the middle
of a room, you're giving it a place of prominence. In movies, music,
and sports, the most successful people have great prominence — they're
prominent or famous. Anything that juts out or sticks out has
prominence. Whether prominence comes from being widely known or just
being hard to miss, you can't really ignore anything or anybody that
has achieved prominence.

A driving force of many
people is possessions—not only tangible, material
possessions such as fashionable clothes, homes, cars,
boats, and jewelry, but also the intangible
possessions of fame, glory, or social prominence.
* jeopardy :satellite:
[2019-01-04 Fri 20:18]

To be in jeopardy is to be in danger. Eating three plates of nachos a
day may improve your chances of winning your office's nacho-eating
contest; unfortunately, it could also put your health in jeopardy.

Jeopardy is a state of being, so this word is almost always preceded
by the preposition "in." The phrase "in jeopardy" is just one of
several ways to convey that someone is in trouble. You can also try
"at risk," "in danger," or — if you're into idioms — "on thin ice,"
"out on a limb," or "up the creek without a paddle."

If my sense of security lies in my reputation or in
the things I have, my life will be in a constant state
of threat and jeopardy that these possessions may be
lost or stolen or devalued.
* inferior :satellite:
[2019-01-04 Fri 20:20]

You might call something inferior if its quality isn't as good as
another, comparable thing, like that kite that you can't get to fly no
matter how fast you run back and forth while your friend's kite soars
overhead.

Besides "lower in quality," another meaning of the adjective inferior
is "lower in rank or status," the way a corporal is inferior to a
general in the Army. The word inferior can also be used as a noun to
mean "a person who is lower in rank or status," in which case you
might say to your younger brother, "You are my inferior, therefore you
should take out the trash."

If I’m in the presence of
someone of greater net worth or fame or status, I feel
inferior.
* selfhood :satellite:

I don’t have any
sense of constancy or anchorage or persistent
selfhood.
* allied :satellite:
[2019-01-04 Fri 23:57]

Allied means united or joined together. If two countries are allied,
they are on the same side and have common interests.

When two people are allied, they are friendly — or at least
cooperative. To be allied means to have an agreement to work together,
so when politicians are allied on a bill, they've pledged to join
forces and unite for a common cause. In a war, allied countries are
fighting on the same side. Allied comes from ally, which first meant
"join in marriage," from the Latin root alligare, "bind to."

Another common center, closely
allied with possessions, is that of fun and pleasure.
* ostensible :satellite:
[2019-01-05 Sat 00:02]

When something is ostensible it appears to be the case but might not
be. Research for a role is the ostensible reason for Nat's drinking.
But I think it's because he just likes to drink.

Just because something is ostensible doesn't necessarily mean that
it's not as it appears to be, only that there's a possibility of
another reason. My ostensible reason for calling Brent was to ask
about work. The real reason was that I was hoping he might ask me out.
Turns out both the ostensible reason and the real reason were true!

For instance, success in all of its
 various guises; being known and being praised;
 ostensible pleasures, like acquiring money or
 seducing women, or traveling, going to and fro in
 the world and up and down in it like Satan,
 explaining and experiencing whatever Vanity Fair
 has to offer.
* distorted :satellite:
[2019-01-05 Sat 00:04]

If you have ever looked at yourself in a funhouse mirror, you probably
saw an image that was quite distorted. Okay, so maybe your hair looked
kind of weird that day, but your whole body wasn’t really that
misshapen.

This adjective is derived from the Latin verb distortus, which means
“to twist different ways.” When something is distorted this can mean
that it has been changed from the original form in any way. Someone
can have a distorted worldview, or facts from an event can be
distorted in the retelling. If a politician is misquoted in the
newspaper, then it could be said that her opinion has been
misrepresented or distorted by the media.

The distorted and ever-changing
social mirror becomes the source for the four
life-support factors, creating a high degree of
dependence on the fluctuating moods, feelings,
attitudes, and behavior of others.
* perceived :satellite:
[2019-01-05 Sat 00:07]

If you sense something is true by instinct, but not necessarily by
fact, you can describe that sense as perceived. If you suspect that
your neighbor's dog might be dangerous, you can say the dog is a
perceived threat to your family's safety.

The adjective perceived has its Latin roots in per, meaning
"thoroughly," and capere, meaning "to grasp." Today it retains a sense
of grasping something mentally or sensing it. Oddly, the word has two
conflicting meanings: first, something you infer or suspect, rather
than detecting with your senses. The second meaning, however, is quite
the opposite: something sensed through your actual senses, especially
those of sight or hearing.

Rather than proactively leading his own life, the
enemy-centered person is counterde-pendently reacting
to the behavior and attitudes of a perceived enemy.

I got to the location over two hours early and

* contradicting :satellite:
[2019-01-08 Tue 21:35]

"Contra-" usually means "against," and to contradict is to go against
or say the opposite of what someone else is doing or saying. Sometimes
to contradict is to frustrate with words, like when one person says
"The sky is blue" and another says "No, it's azure."

Denying or distorting the truth is a big part of trying to contradict.
It can be harmless verbal back-and-forth, like when a husband and wife
disagree just to disagree, or contradict each other to make a humorous
point, but at other times people contradict something to make another
person look like a liar. Often, a person who has lied will later
contradict himself by saying something different from what he said
earlier — and sometimes the two sides contradict each other, and
neither is actually right.

There are some people who get so busy in church worship
and projects that they become insensitive to the pressing
human needs that surround them, contradicting the very
precepts they profess to believe deeply.
* precepts :satellite:
[2019-01-08 Tue 21:36]

A precept is a rule or direction, often with some religious basis,
dictating a way you should act or behave.

Precepts are little life lessons that are usually passed down to
children by authority figures such as parents, teachers, or religious
figures. They are not as simple or practical as "eat your vegetables";
they tend to be more weighty and pretentious. In Hamlet, the character
Polonius dished out a few choice precepts to his son Laertes: "neither
a borrower nor a lender be" and "give every man thy ear, but few thy
voice." Of course Laertes never lived long enough to benefit from
Polonius's sage advice, since Hamlet offed him with his own poisoned
blade.

There are some people who get so busy in church worship
and projects that they become insensitive to the pressing
human needs that surround them, contradicting the very
precepts they profess to believe deeply.

* hypocrisy :satellite:
[2019-01-10 Thu 19:13]

People who go to church but don't believe in god? People who are
vegetarians on a moral basis but wear leather jackets? They are
engaging in hypocrisy, or behavior that is different from what they
say they believe.

A hypocrite is a person who practices hypocrisy: what they say is not
what they do. The noun hypocrisy descends from the Greek hypokrisis
"acting on a stage," from hypokrinesthai "to play a part, pretend,"
from the prefix hypo- "under" plus krinein "to judge." Many times kids
are enraged by their parents' hypocrisy when parents make their
children follow rules they don't follow themselves.

In the church-centered life, image or appearance can
become a person’s dominant consideration, leading to
hypocrisy that undermines personal security and intrinsic
worth.
* compartments :satellite:
[2019-01-10 Thu 19:14]

A compartment is a space within another space, like the glove
compartment in a car.

Compartments are spaces, but they're not spaces that stand on their
own. Rather, compartments are part of other spaces: they're
subdivisions. The trunk is a compartment of a car. A pocket is a
compartment of a suitcase. Closets are like compartments of rooms. One
of the most common compartments is a car's glove compartment, where
people throw all kinds of things. Anything that is divided into
smaller spaces has compartments. The ventricles are like compartments
of your heart.

Church-centered people often tend to live in
compartments, acting and thinking and feeling in certain
ways on the Sabbath and in totally different ways on
weekdays.
* stagnant :satellite:
[2019-01-10 Thu 19:17]

There is a tone to the word stagnant that sounds like what it is:
lacking movement, stale, and inactive, especially with exaggerated
pronunciation, "staaaagnant."

Stagnant came into use in the 17th century as a description for water
or air that wasn't moving or circulating, like in a scum-covered pond
or a closed-off room. Often things that are stagnant also have a smell
from sitting too long in one place. Not that this happens to everyone,
but sitting in front of a TV playing video games without moving more
than the fingers can make a person stagnant, sometimes with an
accompanying odor.

It becomes stagnant.
* seductive :satellite:
[2019-01-10 Thu 21:23]

Seductive is an adjective that describes the fascinating magnetic pull
that someone or something has, an attractive quality that tempts you
in some way.

A seductive person catches your eye and won’t let it go. The word
comes from the Latin seducere, meaning “draw aside.” When someone
draws your attention aside from whatever you’re doing, that is a
seductive person. Radio people often have seductive voices that lull
you to sleep, and stores put their most seductive items in the front
window in hopes that you’ll be tempted to come inside and buy them.

seductive vs voluntarily
* vocation :satellite:
[2019-01-11 Fri 20:57]

Unless you can find someone to pay you to sip fancy tropical drinks on
the beach, your vocation is not likely to be a vacation. Rather, the
word means something you know how to do––or what you do for a living.

The word vocation derives from the Latin vocare "to call." To become a
priest, you need to feel that you have been "called" to the ministry
directly by God. Their job is their calling, or vocation. An avocation
is something you do because you love it. Everyone should make it their
goal to have their avocation become their vocation.

In Frankl’s words,
“Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in
life….
* abdicate :satellite:
[2019-01-11 Fri 21:00]

Sometimes someone in power might decide to give up that power and step
down from his or her position. When they do that, they abdicate their
authority, giving up all duties and perks of the job.

The original meaning of the verb abdicate came from the combination of
the Latin ab- "away" and dicare "proclaim." (Note that in the charming
relationships between languages with common roots, the Spanish word
for "he says" is dice, which comes directly from dicare.) The word
came to refer to disowning one's children, and it wasn't until the
17th century that the first use of the word relating to giving up
power or public office was recorded.

To seek some abstract meaning to our lives out in our
Circle of Concern is to abdicate our proactive
reponsibility, to place our own first creation in the
hands of circumstance and other people.
