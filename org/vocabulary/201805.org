  noun
   1. an act or the sound of expelling air from the nose in a sneeze.
      "he stopped a sudden sneeze"

  verb
   1. make a sudden involuntary expulsion of air from the nose and mouth due to irritation of one's nostrils.

  When you sneeze, you blow air forcefully (and involuntarily) out of
  your nose and mouth, possibly while making a sound that might be
  spelled "achoo!" Allergies, pepper, and dust are all famous for making
  people sneeze.

  Behind every sneeze is some kind of irritant, a foreign substance that
  bothers the mucous membranes inside your nose. Pollen, cat dander, and
  the inflammation of your nose caused by a cold virus can all cause a
  sneeze (or several sneezes). When you sneeze, muscles in your face,
  neck, and chest contract reflexively. In rare cases, very bright
  lights or eating a large meal can make people sneeze. Go figure!

 tiered
*** --->
  многоуровневого

  verb
   1. располагать ярусами (tier, tier up)


  Something that is arranged in a series of levels or layers is tiered.
  Towering wedding cakes are often tiered, with the smallest layer at
  the very top.

  Stadium or theater seating is tiered — each row of seats is placed
  slightly above the row in front of it, so that people sitting in the
  back can see over the heads of the audience members in front. Skirts
  and dresses sometimes have tiered ruffles, each layer a bit higher
  than the one beneath it. The adjective tiered comes from tier, or
  "row," from the Old French tire, "rank or sequence."

  Because
  microservices are primarily modeled around business
  domains, they avoid the problems of traditional tiered
  architectures.

  noun

   2. западня (trap, snare, pitfall, mantrap, pit, mesh)
   3. волчья яма (pit, pitfall)
   4. рытвина (pothole, gully, hollow, pitfall, delve)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a hidden or unsuspected danger or difficulty.
      "He bought some books on self-publishing and brushed up on the perils and pitfalls involved."


  A pitfall is a trap or difficulty you didn't see. A possible pitfall
  for high school seniors is not working hard after they know they've
  already been accepted into college.

  In 1300, pitfall referred to an animal trap, such as branches laid
  across a deep hole offering no escape. Since the 1580s, pitfall has
  come to describe any hidden or unexpected difficulty, and its meaning
  has expanded to apply to humans. You might encounter a pitfall when
  trying to use a brand new computer program that's unexpectedly
  precise. It can even be a habit you don't want to address, like the
  pitfalls of snacking in front of the television every night.

  Microservices also integrate new
  technologies and techniques that have emerged over the
  last decade, which helps them avoid the pitfalls of many
  service-oriented architecture implementations.

   3. проникновенный (profound)

   4. океан (ocean, pond, deep, blue, main, profound)
   5. пучина (abyss, gulf, depth, profound, abysm, vortex)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. (of a state, quality, or emotion) very great or intense.
      "profound social changes"
   2. (of a person or statement) having or showing great knowledge or insight.
      "a profound philosopher"
   3. at, from, or extending to a great depth; very deep.
      "he opened the door with a profound bow"

  noun
   1. the vast depth of the ocean or of the mind.


  When you need a word that's deeper than "deep," consider profound.

  Profundus meant literally "deep" in Latin, and profound had the same
  meaning when it entered English in the 14th century. But even then, it
  also meant "figuratively deep" — that is, very great or intense: "The
  new laws have had a profound impact." Of people, it means "very
  knowledgeable or insightful," but sometimes if a person tries to sound
  profound they're really just giving you superficial knowledge dressed
  up with big words.

  Although the idea is not new
  (even if the term itself is), experiences from people all over the
  world, along with the emergence of new technologies, are having a
  profound effect on how they are used.

   7. замешанность (implication)
   8. то, что подразумевается (connotation, implicate, implication)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the conclusion that can be drawn from something, although it is not explicitly stated.
      "the implication is that no one person at the bank is responsible"
   2. the action or state of being involved in something.
      "our implication in the problems"


  An implication is something that is suggested, or happens, indirectly.
  When you left the gate open and the dog escaped, you were guilty by
  implication.

  Implication has many different senses: Usually used in the plural,
  implications are effects or consequences that may happen in the
  future. You might ask, "What are the implications of our decision?"
  Implication is also the state of being implicated, or connected to
  something bad: "Are you surprised by their implication that you were
  involved in the crime?"

   technology implications, as we discuss what sorts of service

   2. рыться (rummage, delve, burrow, scrabble, rummage about, rummage in)
   3. копать (dig, delve, excavate, peck, shovel, scoop)

   1. впадина (cavity, depression, hollow, trough, valley, delve)
   2. рытвина (pothole, gully, hollow, pitfall, delve)
   3. шурф (pit, hole, delve)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. reach inside a receptacle and search for something.
      "she delved in her pocket"


  The verb delve means to dig into, loosen, or investigate. She delved
  into her family's history and discovered an inventor, a checkers
  champion, and a circus equestrian in her ancestry.

  Delve has a literal meaning of to dig into the earth ("to delve the
  soil," as in preparing a garden, for example), but this sense is rare
  now. The verb is most often used in the more figurative sense — like
  to delve into a problem or into someone's personal life.

  noun
   1. наследие (heritage, legacy, inheritance, patrimony, heirloom, hangover)
   2. наследство (inheritance, heritage, legacy, patrimony, bequest, residue)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. an amount of money or property left to someone in a will.
      "Bentham tells the family that they are about to inherit a legacy from a relative."

  adjective
   1. denoting software or hardware that has been superseded but is difficult to replace because of its wide use.
      "Then new projects that could have gone with the legacy platform start going to the new one."


  Use the word, legacy, for something handed down from one generation to
  the next. A retiring company president might leave a legacy of honesty
  and integrity.

  Legacy comes from the Latin verb, legare "to appoint by a last will,
  send as an ambassador." Originally, the noun meant "ambassador" or
  "envoy" but soon shifted to mean the money and property a person
  leaves behind in his will. Many university scholarships are funded by
  the legacies of former students. In recent usage, political leaders
  are said to be concerned with their legacies, the historically
  significant achievements of their tenure in office.

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. pressed firmly together, in particular.
      "The impacted , partially air-filled material was seen in the distal esophagus."
   2. strongly affected by something.
      "grandiose planning projects have had deleterious effects on impacted social groups"

  verb
   1. come into forcible contact with another object.
      "the shell impacted twenty yards away"
   2. have a strong effect on someone or something.
      "high interest rates have impacted on retail spending"


  If your doctor tells you that something is impacted, that's not a good
  thing. It means wedged together and unable to move.

  Wisdom teeth are often impacted, which makes one question how wise
  they actually are. A fractured bone can be impacted as well, which
  means the two broken ends are wedged together. Perhaps you could say
  that your Christmas stocking is so jam packed and impacted with
  goodies that you can barely pull anything out — but that's about the
  only non-painful association with the word imaginable.

   7. отвлеченный (abstract, notional, abstractive, discrete)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. individually separate and distinct.
      "speech sounds are produced as a continuous sound signal rather than discrete units"


  Discrete means separate or divided. A discrete unit is a separate part
  of something larger. A room is a discrete space within a house, just
  as the crankshaft is a discrete part of a car engine.

  If something is discrete, it has its own space. An ice cube comes from
  an ice tray, but it has its own discrete compartment. A student
  government might have discrete committees for different projects.
  Don't confuse discrete with its close cousin discreet, which means
  “appropriately private.” Billionaire Bruce Wayne, for example, is very
  discreet about his secret life as Batman. You could say Batman is a
  discrete, or separate, part of Bruce Wayne’s identity. Anything
  distinct and separated is discrete.

  This chapter goes deep into the topic of testing, an area of
   particular concern when handling the deployment of multiple

   8. спрямлять (align, aline, square up)
   9. строиться (align, fall in, parade, troop, aline, form)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. place or arrange (things) in a straight line.
      "gently brush the surface to align the fibers"
   2. give support to (a person, organization, or cause).
      "newspapers usually align themselves with certain political parties"


  To align means to bring something into a straight line, or an easy
  agreement. If you always park on an angle and people are leaving mean
  notes on your windshield, learn to align the car with the parking
  space.

  Align comes from the French a, meaning "to" and ligne meaning "line,"
  and it means to bring something into line with something else. This
  can be literal. If you are hanging a painting, you'll want to align it
  with the window frame. The line can also be metaphorical. If you run
  for office, your political opinions will need to be aligned with those
  of your supporters.

  We’ll attempt to

   5. выдавать замуж (marry, marry off, give in marriage, wed, espouse, match)
   6. признавать (confess, accept, recognize, admit, acknowledge, espouse)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. adopt or support (a cause, belief, or way of life).
      "he turned his back on the modernism he had espoused in his youth"
   2. marry.
      "Edward had espoused the Lady Grey"


  Use the verb espouse to describe the actions of someone who lives
  according to specific beliefs, such as your friends who espouse
  environmentalism and as a result walk whenever possible instead of
  taking the car.

  You can see the word spouse in espouse, so you may be wondering what
  husbands and wives have to do with it. Originally espouse did mean "to
  marry," but its meaning has evolved to include other long-term
  commitments as well, such as support for a principle or a cause.
  Similar to marriage, if you espouse a belief system, the idea is that
  you've chosen to wed yourself to it.

  Some large, successful organizations like Amazon
  and Google espoused the view of small teams owning the full lifecycle
  of their services.

  adverb
   1. сосредоточенно (intently)

  DEFINITION

  adverb
   1. with earnest and eager attention.
      "he gazed at her intently"


  If you're studying something intently, you're probably leaning forward
  and you're oblivious to whatever is going on around you. Your
  attention is focused like a laser.

  If you're gazing intently into someone's eyes, you're hanging on to
  every blink of the eye, every nuance of expression. Maybe you're in
  love. When you do something intently, you do it with intensity. It's
  not a coincidence that intently sounds a lot like intensity, as they
  both come from the Latin intendere, made up of in- ("toward") and
  tendere ("stretch"). So when you're listening intently to a Bartók
  string quartet, you're stretching and straining to hear every note.

   2. the temporary cessation or suspension of something.
      "The Applicant has set in motion an appeal from the disciplinary panel to an appeal panel but that appeal has been put into suspense by reason of his application for judicial review."


  Suspense is a feeling of excited waiting. If you have been waiting for
  weeks to get an answer to your proposal of marriage, you are being
  kept in suspense.

  The verb form, suspend, literally means to keep hanging. Suspense can
  be used in all sorts of ways. Movies that keep you on the edge of your
  seat in fear use suspense to draw you in. Suspense doesn’t always have
  to be scary, but it is usually agitating. If you are in suspense,

  A faculty refers to any of your mental or physical abilities. If you
  lose your faculties, you are powerless. The faculty of a school is
  comprised of the people who work there. Lose them, and you have a
  different kind of problem.

  Faculty comes from the Old French word faculté, which means “skill,
  accomplishment, or learning.” You may have great faculties of memory,
  sight, mobility, charm, math, and musicality, but, as Beethoven was in
  the end, be robbed of your faculty of hearing. Any aptitude or ability
  — inborn or learned — that you have is a faculty. Also, if you go to
  school, your teachers make up the faculty of that school.

  An education which should
  improve this faculty would be the education par excellence.”

 voluntarily
*** --->
  добровольно

  adverb
   1. добровольно (voluntarily, mere of motion, of one's own free will)

  DEFINITION

  adverb
   1. of one's own free will.
      "many restaurants voluntarily removed it from their menus"


  Use the adverb voluntarily to describe something you do willingly. For
  example, you might voluntarily stay home and babysit your little
  brother if the alternative is a trip to the grocery store.

  People do things voluntarily when they are completely willing to do
  them, not forced or enticed by anyone else. Kids tend to eat candy
  voluntarily, ride their bikes with their friends voluntarily, and
  watch their favorite shows on TV voluntarily. It's easy to see the
  connection with the verb to volunteer, and both words are rooted in
  the Latin root voluntarius, "of one's free will."

  As early as
  the end of the nineteenth century, William James, the father of
  modern psychology, wrote that “the faculty of voluntarily bringing
  back a wandering attention, over and over again, is the very root of
  judgment, character, and will.

  adjective
   1. ощутимый (tangible, palpable, perceptible, appreciable, sensible, tactile)
   2. осязаемый (tangible, palpable, touchable, tactile)
   3. очевидный (evident, obvious, apparent, demonstrable, visible, palpable)
   4. явный (explicit, obvious, apparent, sheer, evident, palpable)
   5. прощупываемый (palpable)
   6. ощутительный (palpable, appreciable)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. able to be touched or felt.
      "the palpable bump at the bridge of the nose"


  When something is palpable, you can touch or handle it, even though
  the word is often used to describe things that usually can't be
  handled or touched, such as emotions or sensations.

  You probably won't see palpable used to describe, say, an egg or a
  doorknob or a motorcycle. Palpable is usually reserved for situations
  in which something invisible becomes so intense that it feels as
  though it has substance or weight. When the towers came down, the
  sense of sadness was so great, it was palpable.

  When we
  are forced to do multiple things at once, not only do we perform
  worse on all of them but our memory decreases and our general
  well-being suffers a palpable hit.

  noun
   1. осознание (awareness, realization, perception, knowing)
   2. осведомленность (awareness, knowledge, information, conversance, privity, info)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. knowledge or perception of a situation or fact.
      "we need to raise public awareness of the issue"


  Awareness is the state of knowing something, such as the awareness
  that the sun comes up every morning.

  The adjective aware gets turned into a noun when the suffix -ness is
  added, so awareness is the state of being aware, or having knowledge
  of something. Its roots are Germanic, and come from the Old English
  wær meaning "wary, cautious." Awareness can be something you notice,
  want to tell others about, or already know. You could "raise
  awareness" of a cause, like fighting breast cancer. Yet, your
  awareness of the baby sleeping next door might prevent you from having
  band practice in the garage. Smart move.

  The adverb blithely describes something you do in a casually cheerful,
  somewhat neglectful way, like when you blithely ride your bike down
  the street, not even thinking about all the homework you have to do.

  Something that's done blithely is careless, like a group of kids
  blithely dashing off across a frozen pond on their ice skates,
  forgetting about their slower friend. You could talk blithely about
  your brand new laptop, forgetting that your friend can't afford a new
  computer. Blithely also means "happily," without implying that
  anything is being overlooked or ignored, like a winning team blithely
  celebrating their victory.

  We sail on, blithely unaware of how much we are missing, of
  how little we grasp of our own thought process—and how much better we
  could be if only we’d taken the time to understand and to reflect.

  noun
   1. тяжелая походка (plod)
   2. тяжелый путь (plod)
   3. тяжелая работа (heavy work, drudgery, slog, fag, elbow grease, plod)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. walk doggedly and slowly with heavy steps.
      "we plodded back up the hill"

  noun
   1. a slow, heavy walk.
      "he settled down to a steady plod"


  When you plod, you walk slowly, heavily, and deliberately. You might
  need to plod through the snow to get to the bus stop on time.

  Plod evokes a difficulty in walking — like when you trudge through mud
  or walk slowly up a steep hill. You might plod home at the end of a
  long day, or plod through an overgrown field on a hot afternoon. You
  can also use plod figuratively, to mean "work on something boring or
  monotonous." The origin of plod is unknown, but it may have come from
  the sound of feet on the ground — the sound you make when you plod.

  Like Watson, we plod along the same staircase tens, hundreds,
  thousands of times, multiple times a day, and we can’t begin to
  recall the most mundane of details about them (I wouldn’t be
  surprised if Holmes had asked about color instead of number of steps
  and had found Watson equally ignorant).

  Engender is a fancy way of saying "to make happen," like when you
  engender the spirit of teamwork and cooperation by encouraging others
  and doing your share of the group's work.

  The verb engender has nothing to do with being male or female, though
  originally, it did mean "beget, procreate." Today, engender means "to
  produce or bring about." When students come to class prepared, meaning
  they've read their assignment, this engenders better class
  discussions, just as mutual trust and the desire to help each other
  engenders a meaningful friendship.

   3. occur with or as a result of.
      "people feared that the switch to a peacetime economy would be attended by a severe slump"


  The verb attend means to be present, to listen, or give care or
  attention to. You can attend your family reunion, attend to a project
  you've been ignoring, or attend to your teacher's voice.

  When you use attend as "pay attention" or "take care of," it's
  followed by "to." When you use attend as in "attend a party," you
  don't. If you attend a political rally, you'll want to attend to what
  the politicians have to say. When you take attendance, you are
  checking which students have chosen to attend class, i.e. who is in
  attendance.

  never a good idea, unless you want inedible food or a kitchen fire.

  The verb deviate can refer to divergence from a predicted path or road
  ("the airplane's route deviated from the flight plan"), but it can
  also refer to a divergence from normal behavior or expectations. When
  women demanded the right to vote, their behavior was considered
  shocking and deviated from the expectations of the time.

  Have you ever had a light shine in your face so you couldn't see for a

  car's high-beam lights can dazzle other drivers. Looking directly at

  The nifty thing about dispel is that you can use it when talking about
  emotional problems (such as worries and fears) as well as physical
  ones (such as wild dogs). Note, however, that when dispel is used in
  reference to physical foes, it often has the added meaning of
  scattering your opponents in all directions. So, while you can dispel
  a pack of wild dogs, you should just chase off or drive away a lone
  wolf. Good luck with that, by the way.

  If something is hostile, it's unfriendly. If you are zealous about the

  Hostile comes from the Latin word hostis, for enemy, and you can hear

  animals, like bats and fireflies, who sleep during the day and come
  out to play when the sun goes down. The opposite of nocturnal is

  To maim something is to disfigure it through force or violence.
  Wartime battles have a tendency to maim soldiers.

  The verb maim is related to mayhem, which, historically, was the act
  of hurting another person so badly that they couldn’t defend
  themselves. To maim a person or animal, even if it’s an accident, is
  to render them defenseless or disfigured, and it frequently includes
  the loss of a limb. The goal of driving defensively is to avoid an
  accident that could maim you, your passengers, or other people on the

  verb
   1. kill (animals) for food.
      "When I say meat, I do mean slaughtered animals killed for food."


  Slaughter refers to the killing of large numbers of animals or people.
  When cattle are old enough, they're sent to slaughter and their meat
  is processed and shipped to stores.

  The noun slaughter was first used in the 1300s and comes from the Old
  Norse word slahtr, which also described the mass killing of animals or
  people. A verb form came along later, in the 1530s. You might hear
  slaughter used to describe the killing of large numbers of people in a
  war, a genocide, or a massacre. It also can be used figuratively to
  describe a crushing defeat, like the slaughter of your basketball team
  by your bitter rivals.

  In the spring of 1907, Edalji was finally cleared of the charge of
  animal slaughter.

  investigations, not for the purpose of finding out who was the guilty
  party, but for the purpose of finding evidence against Edalji, who
  they were already sure was the guilty man.”

 miscarriage
*** --->
  выкидыш

  noun
   1. выкидыш (miscarriage, abortion, abortive, misbirth, miss)
   2. ошибка (error, mistake, fault, flaw, fallacy, miscarriage)
   3. неудача (failure, fail, bad luck, bad, setback, miscarriage)
   4. недоставка по адресу (miscarriage)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the expulsion of a fetus from the womb before it is able to survive independently, especially spontaneously or as the result of accident.
      "his wife had a miscarriage"
   2. an unsuccessful outcome of something planned.
      "the miscarriage of the project"


  A miscarriage, in medical terms, is the birth of a fetus before it's
  able to live independently of its mother. In other words, a
  miscarriage is the abrupt, early end of a pregnancy.

  The medical sense of miscarriage, which usually describes the very
  early loss of a pregnancy (later losses are often called stillbirths),
  is actually among the newer uses of the word. In the sixteenth
  century, a miscarriage was almost always a "mistake or error" or
  sometimes "misbehavior." Today, when something doesn't go the way it
  was supposed to, you might call it a miscarriage.

  And in August of that year, England saw the creation of its first
  court of appeals, to deal with future miscarriages of justice in a
  more systematic fashion.
* impetuse                                                           :Holmes:
[2018-05-05 Sat 09:13]

An impetus is the force behind something, whether it's a boulder
rolling down a hill or a person making a decision.

Very little would get done if there were no such thing as an impetus:
an impetus is some kind of force that gets something or somebody
moving. If you push a car that's out of gas, you're the impetus that's
getting it moving. An impetus doesn't have to be physical. Advertisers
hope their commercials will be an impetus to buy the product.

The Edalji case was widely considered one of the main impetuses behind
its creation.

  adjective
   1. утомительный (tedious, tiring, tiresome, exhausting, weary, wearisome)
   2. изнурительный (exhausting, grueling, wearisome, backbreaking, tiring, wasting)
   3. скучный (boring, dull, tedious, blah, uninspired, wearisome)
   4. наводящий тоску (depressing, wearisome)
   5. изнуряющий (harassing, exacting, wearisome)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. causing one to feel tired or bored.
      "It would be wearisome to go into any more detail."


  Anything that's boring, tedious, or so dull that it puts you to sleep
  can be described as wearisome. Long bus rides and long classroom
  lectures can both be wearisome.

  The adjective wearisome is good for describing things that seem to
  last forever, that require repetition, or that are otherwise both
  boring and mentally exhausting. Always being told "Be careful!" by
  your parents can be wearisome, and typing data into a computer all day
  is also wearisome. The original, fifteenth century meaning of
  wearisome was "weary" or "tired," but it quickly came to mean "making
  one weary," from the Old English root werig, "tired."

  “I shall not mention the name which must have become wearisome to
  your ears,” Meredith told Conan Doyle, “but the creator of the
  marvellous Amateur Detective has shown what he can do in the life of
  breath.”

   3. затасканный (hackneyed, hack, trite)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. (of a remark, opinion, or idea) overused and consequently of little import; lacking originality or freshness.
      "this point may now seem obvious and trite"


  When you want to indicate that something is silly or overused, you
  would call it trite. A love song with lyrics about holding hands in
  the sunshine? Totally trite.

  Trite has a Latin root, the past participle of terere, meaning "wear
  out." An old-fashioned or outdated definition of the word is "frayed
  or worn out by use," and you can see how the meaning for an object
  that is worn out can be applied to an idea that has been used to the
  point of being meaningless. The antonym of this word is original.

  Another somewhat trite answer I can give is small enough and no
  smaller.

   1. a person who inspires or influences others, especially one prominent in a particular sphere.
      "one of the luminaries of child psychiatry"
   2. an artificial light.
      "We offer an exciting range of lighting and luminaries that have the ability to accentuate, to harmonize, to enhance, and to convey a mood."


  In scientific writing, Stephen J. Hawking is a luminary. People look
  up to this well-known scientist and author for his knowledge and
  insight.

  Although luminary can mean an object or celestial body that gives off
  light, you'll often hear people talk about parties at which there were
  many luminaries in attendance. In this case, luminary means celebrity
  or well-known person in sports or politics, science or the arts. Think
  of them as being bright lights that make a party sparkle.

  Perhaps William Gillette or Basil Rathbone or
  Jeremy Brett or any number of the luminaries who have, over the
  years, taken up Holmes’s mantle, including the current portrayals by
  Benedict Cumberbatch and Robert Downey, Jr.

   1. a risky or daring journey or undertaking.
      "pioneering ventures into little-known waters"

  verb
   1. dare to do something or go somewhere that may be dangerous or unpleasant.
      "she ventured out into the blizzard"


  A venture is a risky undertaking. If your latest venture is a dog food
  store, you hope there are some hungry dogs around. Also, to venture is
  to go somewhere possibly dangerous, like if you venture out into a
  snowstorm.

  Venture is a shortened form of adventure. This happened sometime
  between 1100 AD and 1400 AD during the time that Middle English was
  spoken. While the two words are similar in meaning, when you subtract
  the "ad," you lose a teaspoon or two of fun, and add a heaping
  tablespoon of risk.

  Whatever the pictures your mind brings up, I would venture to guess
  that the word psychologist isn’t one of them.

   1. a person or thing competing with another for the same objective or for superiority in the same field of activity.
      "he has no serious rival for the job"

  verb
   1. compete for superiority with; be or seem to be equal or comparable to.
      "the efficiency of the Bavarians rivals that of the Viennese"


  A rival is a competitor or contender that you want to defeat, whether
  in an actual competition or for another goal. It may be a tennis rival
  or a rival for your true love’s affections.

  There are all types of rivals, but they tend to show up a lot in
  sports. For example, in college football, the Army and Navy have been
  rivals since their first meeting in 1890. Something that is able to
  rival something else is seen as comparable to it in quality, and
  something that is said to be “without rival” is unmatched, or better
  than everything else.

  But his insights
  into the human mind rival his greatest feats of criminal justice.

      "this was an issue transcending party politics"


  It would be nice to transcend the narrow limits of this brief
  definition, and go to greater lengths to describe this word's glories!
  Transcend means to move upward and beyond something.

  No doubt you know about the words transcontinental or maybe trans
  fats? The prefix trans is used to mean "beyond, across" and transcend
  takes this even farther by adding in a sense of upwardness with the
  stem cend. A pop artist with a lot of talent might transcend the genre
  of pop. You can't assume a person's opinion on national security by
  party affiliation — it often transcends party lines.

  It is an approach born out of the scientific method that transcends
  science and crime both and can serve as a model for thinking, a way
  of being, even, just as powerful in our time as it was in Conan
  Doyle’s.

      "his ubiquitous influence was felt by all the family"


  It's everywhere! It's everywhere! When something seems like it's
  present in all places at the same time, reach for the adjective
  ubiquitous.

  "Cities like Singapore aim to cloak themselves in ubiquitous, free
  Wi-Fi in the next few years," The Wall Street Journal reported
  recently — meaning that those savvy Singaporeans will find a wireless
  connection everywhere they go. The word, comes from the Latin ubique,
  meaning — you guessed it — "everywhere." The usual pronunciation is
  "yoo-BIK-wih-tihs," but Joseph Heller must have had the older variant
  "ooh-BIK-wih-tihs" in mind when he wrote in Catch-22 that a character
  "padded through the shadows fruitlessly like an ubiquitous spook."

  And that, I would argue, is the secret to
  Holmes’s enduring, overwhelming, and ubiquitous appeal.

      "the fever was a somber presage of his final illness"

  verb
   1. (of an event) be a sign or warning that (something, typically something bad) will happen.
      "the outcome of the game presaged the coming year"


  A presage is a sign that something bad is about to happen, like when
  you get that queasy feeling in your stomach because your mom found out
  you skipped band practice to go to the movies.

  Presage, pronounced "PREH-sige," can be a noun or a verb. As a noun,
  presage is a warning or omen of bad things to come, like a strange
  quiet and stillness in the air, presage to the coming tornado. As a
  verb, presage means "making a prediction or giving a warning of what's
  to come," like a terrible end-of-season football game's outcome game
  that presaged the struggles the team faced the next season.

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. instill (an attitude, idea, or habit) by persistent instruction.
      "the failures of the churches to inculcate a sense of moral responsibility"


  To inculcate is to teach through frequent instruction. If you
  repeatedly tell your brother how important it is to be responsible,
  then you’re trying to inculcate in him a sense of responsibility.

  The word inculcate traces back to the Latin word inculcare, meaning
  “to force upon or to stamp in.” If anyone has even tried to inculcate
  you with something, it may seem as if something is being stamped into
  your brain — over and over and over. A key thing to remember about
  this word is repetition: something, such as a value or a belief, is
  instilled in the brain by the persistent restating of its importance.

  As Conan

  observation which I have heard you inculcate, I have tried to build

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a confusing and difficult problem or question.
      "one of the most difficult conundrums for the experts"


  The tricky word conundrum is used to describe a riddle or puzzle,
  sometimes including a play on words or pun.

  One of the most famous conundrums is the riddle of the Sphinx,
  famously in the play Oedipus the King by Sophocles. Oedipus encounters
  the Sphinx, a mythical beast, who asks him, "What walks on four legs
  in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three in the evening?" The
  answer is "A person": crawling as a child, walking as an adult, and
  using a cane in old age. The scary thing is that if the Sphinx asked
  you the riddle and you didn't know, she'd eat you!

  midnight or working late.

  Deem comes from the Old English word, deman — meaning "act as a
  judge." If you deem something, you essentially become the judge of
  whether it has a characteristic. For example, if you deem your little
  sister's jokes to be too ridiculous to listen to, you will probably

  can also mean not relevant or essential, like all the extraneous
  information in your long-winded science report.

  In Latin, extra means outside, as in extraordinary "outside the
  ordinary," or extraterrestrial 'coming from outside earth.' (Bonus
  points––ding! ding!––if you knew that terra is Latin for "earth.") The

  Apparently is an adverb meaning "evidently" or "obviously." After his
  sixth hot dog, you might say to your friend, "Well! Apparently
  somebody was hungry!"

  While apparently can mean "plainly" — like, duh — it can also mean
  "seemingly," which is almost "evidently" or "obviously," but not
  quite. There's a certain amount of guessing involved, based on
  appearances. The park ranger who shows up in the morning to examine
  the path of destruction through your campsite might say that it was
  "apparently the work of a hungry bear," not because he's totally sure,
  but because it definitely looks like something the bears around here
  would do.

  Before you even begin to ask the questions that will define the

      "the disposal of his shares in the company"
   3. the arrangement or positioning of something.
      "she brushed her hair carefully, as if her success lay in the sleek disposal of each gleaming black thread"


  Disposal means getting rid of something, or throwing it away. When you
  go on a picnic, be sure to have a bag for the disposal of your trash
  afterward, or you will be a terrible litterbug.

  You can use a garbage disposal, a grinder in your sink drain that
  allows you to wash down certain waste items without causing clogs, for
  the disposal of vegetable scraps. In addition to meaning "getting rid
  of something," disposal can also mean "the power or means to
  accomplish something." If you have a fleet of limousines at your
  disposal, it's easy to get a large number of guests to a wedding.

  Consternation is a noun that can stop you in your tracks because it
  means "a sudden, alarming amazement or dread that results in utter
  confusion; dismay."

  If you have a sense of consternation you have become afraid,
  disoriented, or completely befuddled. It comes from the Latin roots
  con- and -sternare, which means "spread out." Picture all of your
  thoughts strewn about, nothing makes sense and you might experience a

   1. восторг (delight, enthusiasm, rapture, admiration, elation, exaltation)
   2. приподнятое настроение (elation, ginger)
   3. бурная радость (elation)
   4. энтузиазм (enthusiasm, passion, ardor, steam, elation, will)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. great happiness and exhilaration.
      "Richard's elation at regaining his health was short-lived"


  If you experience sudden very high spirits, possibly even a feeling of
  lightness, you are feeling great elation.

  Elation is more than mere happiness — it is extreme, exhilarating joy.
  It has a sense of rising or expanding, even to the point of
  light-headedness. To help remember it, think of the (unrelated) word
  inflation, which has a similar sound. When you inflate a tire, you
  pump it up. When you are filled with elation, you are also, in a
  sense, "pumped up."

  Alas, his elation was short lived.

  interjection
   1. Увы! (Alas!, Alack!)

  DEFINITION

  exclamation
   1. an expression of grief, pity, or concern.
      "alas, my funds have some limitations"


  Alas is another way to emphatically say “unfortunately.” Perhaps you
  meant to finish up all your homework last night, but alas, your
  favorite television show wound up getting your undivided attention
  instead.

  Letting out a breathy alas in the middle of your sentence may sound
  dramatic or old fashioned, but it's actually an excellent way to
  emphasize extreme bewilderment, regret, concern, or woe. Once an
  expression of weariness rather than grief, alas stems from the Latin
  lassus, meaning “tired, weary.” Exclaimed Lord Byron, the English
  poet, “Alas! The love of women! It is known to be a lovely and fearful
  thing!”

  Alas, his elation was
  short lived.

   9. давать указание (admonish)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. warn or reprimand someone firmly.
      "she admonished me for appearing at breakfast unshaven"


  To admonish is to scold. If you want to show someone you're not happy
  with his behavior, admonish him. It sounds better than "scolding," and
  it's less painful than spanking.

  Coming to English through Old French from the Latin admonere "to
  advise, remind," admonish is always used with an eye on improving
  someone's behavior. The exact meaning of this formal verb varies in
  intensity depending generally on who is being corrected. If a child or
  subordinate is being admonished, it means "scold" or "rebuke" whereas
  if someone admonishes a person with equal standing, warn or advise are
  closer synonyms.

  (As Holmes admonishes Lestrade and Gregson when the two detectives
  fail to note a similarity between the murder being investigated and
  an earlier case, “There is nothing new under the sun.

  noun
   1. усердие (zeal, diligence, fervor, industry, assiduity, painstaking)
   2. старание (diligence, effort, endeavor, application, exertion, painstaking)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. done with or employing great care and thoroughness.
      "painstaking attention to detail"


  If you notice that painstaking is composed of pains and taking, you
  already have a pretty clear sense of what this adjective means: to be
  painstaking is to be so careful—so meticulous, so thorough that it
  hurts.

  Painstaking is most commonly paired with detail — in fact, writers
  might like to avoid the phrase “painstaking detail” as clichéd. In
  contemporary usage, the agony implied by the word often seems to be
  shared by both the person who makes a painstaking effort and the
  person confronted with the fruits of that labor: “Gertrude’s ability
  to appear politely interested was tested as her dinner companion
  related his painstaking attempts to establish himself as the true heir
  to the British throne.”

  To follow Sherlock Holmes is to learn to apply that same approach
  not just to external clues, but to your every thought—and then turn
  it around and apply it to the every thought of every other person
  who may be involved, step by painstaking step.

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. childishly silly and trivial.
      "you're making puerile excuses"


  Some people like their movies to have sophisticated humor and others
  prefer the more puerile humor of pratfalls or jokes about smelly
  underwear, inappropriate belching, and passing gas.

  Although the adjective, puerile can be used to describe anything
  related to childhood, more often than not, it is used in a derisive
  manner to comment on the immaturity, silliness, or juvenile nature of
  something or someone. So if you hear someone talk about puerile toys,
  they may merely be remarking on the toys of childhood, but it is more
  likely they are discussing whoopee cushions, fake dog poo, and the
  like.

  Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of
  observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for.”

  An inference is an idea or conclusion that's drawn from evidence and
  reasoning. An inference is an educated guess.

  We learn about some things by experiencing them first-hand, but we
  gain other knowledge by inference — the process of inferring things
  based on what is already known. When you make an inference, you're
  reading between the lines or just looking carefully at the facts and
  coming to conclusions. You can also make faulty inferences. If you
  hear a person's weight is 250 pounds, you might make the inference
  that they're overweight. But what if they're seven feet tall?

  Are you looking for another word to describe a person who is highly

  adept!

  In the days of Medieval Latin, an adeptus was a person who had learned
  the secrets of alchemy. Although an adept person today cannot turn
  lead into gold, the adjective is still high praise meaning "skilled,
  expert, highly proficient."

  Our brains are remarkably adept at learning new ways of thinking—and

  To pervade means to be present throughout, to exist in every part of.
  If you have too many cats, the horrible smell of cat pee will pervade
  your house.

  You can use pervade both for external things like smells and sickness,
  and for more internal things like feelings. For instance, you can say
  that a feeling of doom pervaded the army as they caught sight of the
  opposition’s superior forces. Despite efforts to prevent bullying,
  peer pressure and clique mentalities pervade the school environment.

  DEFINITION

  verb

      "she was conceived when her father was 49"
   2. form or devise (a plan or idea) in the mind.
      "the dam project was originally conceived in 1977"


  To conceive is to come up with an idea. If you conceive a plan for
  your little brother's birthday, you dream up the perfect party,
  complete with a magician, rented ponies, and a cake shaped like a
  rocket.

  Latin roots for conceive (by way of French) point to "take into"
  either "the womb" or "the mind." An idea is sometimes called "a seed"
  or "the seed of an idea," and conceive means to produce something from
  inside the mind — or to become pregnant. Another expression is
  "pregnant with ideas" or "pregnant with possibilities," and someone
  who can "conceive of a thousand ways" to solve a problem or design
  something is full of new ideas.

  Benedict de Spinoza was the first to conceive of this necessity of
  acceptance for comprehension, and, writing a hundred years before
  Gilbert, William James explained the principle as “All propositions,
  whether attributive or existential, are believed through the very
  fact of being conceived.”

  Hazy usually describes a sky that's fogged over or otherwise unclear.
  But if you're feeling a little uncertain or unsure about something,

  Choose the verb mitigate when something lessens the unpleasantness of
  a situation. You can mitigate your parents' anger by telling them you
  were late to dinner because you were helping your elderly neighbor.

  The somewhat formal verb mitigate comes from the Latin roots mītis
  "soft" and agere "to do/act," which add up to "to soften." It is often
  used with words that indicate an outcome or something harmful. When
  you buy car insurance, you are trying to mitigate the risks involved
  with driving. Sunscreen is used to mitigate the effects of the sun on
  your skin.

  You might describe a society's advancement as a result of new
  industries and an improved economy. You could also cheer your best

  snow will have an impact on driving conditions).

  Impact is used most often as a noun. A good teacher might have an

   3. an overhead compartment.

  Anything that's located above you is overhead — it’s literally over
  your head. An overhead compartment on an airplane is a good place to
  stash your carry-on suitcase. Overhead is also the money it takes to
  run a business.

  Overhead works as both an adjective and an adverb: "An overhead view
  of the football field gives the spectators a better idea of the game,
  and a drone flying overhead is the perfect way to achieve it." There's
  also an overhead stroke in tennis, an overhead projector showing a
  movie in science class, and the overhead, or up-front expenses, that a
  new business requires.

  Embracing multiple technologies doesn’t come without an overhead, of
  course.

   1. the art or technique of setting, writing, or playing a melody or melodies in conjunction with another, according to fixed rules.
      "Valen's approach was derived from Bach, from whose music he evolved a polyphonic technique of dissonant counterpoint ."
   2. an argument, idea, or theme used to create a contrast with the main element.
      "I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgment"

  verb
   1. add counterpoint to (a melody).
      "the orchestra counterpoints the vocal part"
   2. emphasize by contrast.
      "the cream walls and maple floors are counterpointed by black accents"


  To counterpoint is to contrast. If you point out that you should have
  class outside, someone might counterpoint by reminding you that it’s
  raining. In music, counterpoint is when two separate melodies are
  played or sung at the same time.

  When a composer writes a piece of music using voices that follow
  different rhythms or pitches but ultimately come together
  harmonically, she uses counterpoint. You can also use this word as a
  verb to mean "to highlight difference:" "My tidy bookshelves
  counterpoint the mess of papers and books on my desk." The musical
  meaning of counterpoint, "pricking musical notes under the original
  melody on a manuscript," comes from an earlier sewing or quilting
  meaning.

  Another counterpoint to
  concerns about mixing in different technologies is the size.

 undue
*** --->
  несвоевременный

  adjective
   1. несвоевременный (untimely, inopportune, undue, unseasonable, timeless, injudicious)
   2. чрезмерный (excessive, over, undue, superfluous, exceeding, extreme)
   3. неподходящий (unsuitable, inappropriate, improper, inopportune, inept, undue)
   4. по сроку не подлежащий оплате (undue)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. unwarranted or inappropriate because excessive or disproportionate.
      "this figure did not give rise to undue concern"


  When something isn't appropriate or justified, you can describe it as
  undue. For example, an undue delay in a hospital waiting room can be
  dangerous for someone with a bad injury.

  Something that's undue isn't warranted or, often, fair. The phrase
  "undue delay" is a common one, and it means that someone has to wait
  way too long for something, whether it's a building permit or a
  dentist appointment. The adjective has come to mean "excessive," from
  its original definition in the fourteenth century as literally "not
  owing" or "not payable."

  We’ll
  discuss how to make technology choices in Chapter 2, which focuses on
  evolutionary architecture; and in Chapter 4, which deals with
  integration, you’ll learn how to ensure that your services can evolve
  their technology independently of each other without undue coupling.

   4. надстройка (superstructure, bulkhead)
   5. навес (canopy, shed, overhang, awning, sunshade, bulkhead)
   6. крыша над пристройкой (bulkhead)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a dividing wall or barrier between compartments in a ship, aircraft, or other vehicle.
      "The frigates have a double-skinned hull divided by ten bulkheads into watertight compartments."


  The divider or wall between sections of a plane or large ship is
  called a bulkhead. When you're seated in first class on a jet, there's
  a bulkhead between you and the pilot's cabin.

  The bulkhead you're most likely to see is in a commercial airliner,
  dividing the flight crew from the passengers and sometimes the first
  class flyers from those in coach. Other vehicles have them too,
  including submarines and ships — these bulkheads help strengthen the
  vessels and keep different areas watertight. The Old Norse root of
  bulkhead is bálkr, "partition."

  A key concept in resilience engineering is the bulkhead.

  noun
   1. поручение (commission, errand, mission, message, charge, procuratory)
   2. командировка (business trip, mission, assignment, detached duty, official journey, errand)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a short journey undertaken in order to deliver or collect something, often on someone else's behalf.
      "she asked Tim to run an errand for her"


  An errand is a short trip to fulfill some small business. When you’re
  running errands, you’re making a bunch of these all at once.

  The noun errand can refer to the mission of the trip itself. If the
  lines are always long at the bank, then banking may be your least
  favorite errand. If you are off on a wild goose chase, you may be out
  on a fool's errand. If you are taking food or clothing to someone in
  need, then you are on an errand of mercy.

  All day long, you
  remember your errand.

  noun
   1. господство (domination, rule, dominance, dominating, supremacy, ascendancy)
   2. власть (power, authority, rule, control, grip, ascendancy)
   3. доминирующее влияние (ascendancy, ascendency, ascendance, ascendence)
   4. могущественное влияние (ascendancy, ascendance, ascendence, ascendency)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. occupation of a position of dominant power or influence.
      "the ascendancy of good over evil"


  When you assume ascendancy over someone else, you become more powerful
  than they are. Ascendancy is the state of being in a higher position.

  If you look at ascendancy, you see the word, ascend, which means to go
  up. Ascendancy is not so much about going up, but about being up.
  Another word for it is dominance, especially in the context of foreign
  or domestic relations. In school, if you question a teacher's
  ascendancy, you might be told to go to the principal's office. In this
  case, you're challenging the teacher's authority.

  And that automatic forgetfulness, that ascendancy of
  routine and the ease with which a thought can be distracted, is just the
  smallest part—albeit a particularly noticeable one, because we have the
  luxury of realizing that we’ve forgotten to do something—of a much
  larger phenomenon.

   7. встревожить (alarm, discompose, jolt)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. an abrupt rough or violent movement.
      "Any movement shot jolts of electricity to my toes, curling them in pain."

  verb
   1. push or shake (someone or something) abruptly and roughly.
      "a surge in the crowd behind him jolted him forward"


  To jolt someone is to disturb them or make them jump. A jolt is sudden
  and jarring.

  Jolting disturbs or surprises people. If you surprise someone and they
  jump up a little, you jolted them. Alarm clocks jolt people out of
  sleep. A sudden crack of thunder could provide a jolt. The unexpected
  barking of a dog could jolt you. Jolting is quick and not very
  pleasant. A jolt jars and stuns you. Some jolts are more serious:
  crashing your car jolts the people in the car violently.

  Only when something really
  catches our attention or forces us to stop or otherwise jolts us do we
  begin to know, turning on the more thoughtful, reflective, cool sibling.

      "he tripped over his cat"
   2. walk, run, or dance with quick light steps.
      "they tripped up the terrace steps"
   3. activate (a mechanism), especially by contact with a switch, catch, or other electrical device.

      "they prance around tripping out on their hallucinogens"
   6. go on a short journey.
      "when tripping through the Yukon, take some time to explore our museums"


  When you trip, you stumble or lose your footing. As a noun, a trip is
  a journey or outing, like your trip to the library yesterday or your
  trip to Japan last summer.

  You can trip over a bump in the sidewalk, and you can also trip
  another person, or make them stumble (although it's not very nice to
  do so on purpose). The 14th-century meaning of the verb was "tread
  lightly and nimbly, dance, or caper." Experts aren't quite sure how
  trip got from that to "awkwardly stumble."

  It’s awfully easy to
  get tripped up.

  доверчивость

  noun
   1. доверчивость (credulity, trustfulness, gullibility, credulousness)
   2. легковерие (credulity, easiness)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a tendency to be too ready to believe that something is real or true.
      "At one extreme, it is used to represent the unswerving conviction and absolute credulity of the true believer."


  Did you know that if you say credulity ten times fast it starts to
  sound like orange? If you believe that, then you have a lot of
  credulity. Credulity means gullibility, or a willingness to believe
  anything.

  Credulity is a tendency to believe in things too easily and without
  evidence. If a swindler is trying to sell you fake medicine, then he
  is "preying on your credulity." This noun is associated with being
  naïve, gullible or innocent. It shouldn’t be confused with
  credibility, which means “believability,” although it is often misused
  in this way. You might hear someone say, “the farfetched plot of that
  movie strained credulity,” but what he or she really means is
  “believability,” or “credibility.”

  In other words, begin with
  a healthy dose of skepticism instead of the credulity that is your
  mind’s natural state of being.

  noun
   1. a reflex act of opening one's mouth wide and inhaling deeply due to tiredness or boredom.
      "Hugh Bradley was in the pool recently and said the two boys had yawns as wide as a hippopotamus' mouth."

  verb
   1. involuntarily open one's mouth wide and inhale deeply due to tiredness or boredom.
      "he began yawning and looking at his watch"


  The reflex that makes you open your mouth wide, inhale, and then
  exhale is called a yawn. Even seeing photos of other people's yawns
  (or reading the word yawn) can make you yawn.

  We yawn when we're very bored or tired, or when our bodies need an
  influx of oxygen. Scientists aren't completely in agreement about all
  the reasons why we yawn, but the "contagious yawn" happens across all
  human societies and even in non-human animals like chimpanzees and
  dogs. Things can also yawn in a figurative way, when they're open
  wide. Yawn comes from gionian in Old English, "open the mouth wide."

  It’s a difficult proposition, especially to
  take on all at once—after all, it’s the same thing as asking your brain
  to go from its natural resting state to a mode of constant physical
  activity, expending important energy even where it would normally yawn,
  say okay, and move on to the next thing—but not an impossible one,
  especially if you’ve got Sherlock Holmes on your side.

   4. два очка (deuce)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a thing representing, or represented by, the number two, in particular.
   2. the tie score of 40-all in a game, at which a player needs two consecutive points to win the game.
      "Federer was in the sort of form which took him to the Wimbledon title this year, with Blake staving off an amazing 19 out of 20 break-point opportunities, and surviving 10 deuces in one service game."
   3. used as a euphemism for “devil” in expressions of annoyance, impatience, or surprise or for emphasis.
      "how the deuce are we to make a profit?"


  A deuce is one of the number two cards in a deck of cards. Or, in
  tennis, a deuce is a tie that must be broken by someone scoring two
  points in a row. When playing games, remember that when you hear
  deuce, it comes down to two.

  There are two main meanings of deuce, both of which relate to the
  number two. The first is a playing card: the two of clubs, diamonds,
  hearts, or spades is called a deuce. In sports like tennis and ping
  pong, a deuce is a tie. One player must score two consecutive points
  to break the deuce and win. This can go on for a while if the players
  are well-matched. A hard-fought point could feature one deuce after
  another.

  “How the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”

   1. a feeling of irritation or resentment resulting from a slight, especially to one's pride.

  verb
   1. stimulate (interest or curiosity).
      "you have piqued my curiosity about the man"
   2. feel irritated or resentful.
      "she was piqued by his curtness"
   3. pride oneself.
      "He piqued himself on being so with them more than with any one else."

  noun
   1. stiff fabric, typically cotton, woven in a strongly ribbed or raised pattern.


  The verb pique means to make someone angry or annoyed. But when
  something piques your interest or curiosity, here the verb pique just
  means to arouse, stimulate, or excite.

  Both the noun and verb are pronounced "pēk" and were borrowed from a
  French word meaning "a prick, irritation," from Old French, from
  piquer "to prick." So you can see how something that pricks you could
  make you both excited and angry. But it's frustrating––enough to make
  you want to storm away from learning vocab. That storming away, by the
  by, might be called a "fit of pique."

  That answer only piques Watson’s curiosity further.

  verb
   1. (of a person) suffer from a continuous dull pain.

   2. feel intense sadness or compassion.
      "she sat still and silent, her heart aching"
   3. feel an intense desire for.
      "she ached for his touch"


  An ache is a dull, lingering pain. An ache in your calves after your
  morning jog might mean you didn't stretch enough before you started
  running.

  You might describe your discomfort as a head ache or a stomach ache —
  in either case, there's a throbbing or continuous pain. A non-physical
  hurt can also be called an ache, and you can use the word as a verb in
  either case: "It feels like my heart will ache forever, since my sweet
  cat died." The Old English root is acan, "to suffer pain," possibly
  from an imitative Proto-Indo-European word that sounds like a groan.

  And just like a muscle that you never knew you had—one that suddenly
  begins to ache, then develop and bulk up as you begin to use it more and

  verb
   1. put in the wrong place and lose temporarily because of this; mislay.
      "I'm sure the jewelry has just been misplaced, and not stolen"


  When you misplace your car keys, you can't remember where you put
  them. In other words, you temporarily lose them.

  You can use the verb misplace when you can't find something. If you
  misplace your favorite coffee cup, you'll be annoyed, but if you
  misplace your wallet it could cause you real problems. The word
  implies that the object isn't gone for good, but that you unthinkingly
  put it down somewhere. When you combine the prefix mis-, which means
  "bad or wrong," and place, you get misplace — as in placing something
  in a bad spot!

  When we do such decidedly unremarkable things as misplacing our keys or
  losing our glasses only to find them on our head, System Watson is to

      "the moon exerts a force on the Earth"
   2. make a physical or mental effort.

  Exert basically means to put forth effort to do something. For
  example, when you exert yourself in a workout, you can really feel the
  burn in your muscles.

  The Latin verb exserere — with its derivative form exsertus, which is
  the source of our word — means to "put forth." That's where exert gets
  its meaning of physical force — consider that when you try hard at
  something, you put forth effort to do it, you push yourself. But exert
  can refer to other ways you "push": you exert your influence to
  convince others to think your way; when one nation exerts its power on
  another; and gravity exerts its force on us, holding us down on earth.

  But in order to break from that autopiloted mode, we have to be
  motivated to think in a mindful, present fashion, to exert effort on
  what goes through our heads instead of going with the flow.

   1. a conventional way of describing someone who has died or something that has been lost or that has ceased to exist.
      "the late and much lamented Leonard Bernstein"

  verb
   1. mourn (a person's loss or death).
      "he was lamenting the death of his infant daughter"


  Use the adjective lamented to talk fondly about someone who's died.
  You might describe your favorite elementary school teacher as "my dear
  lamented Mrs. McGinty."

  Lamented is often used in the phrase "late lamented," which implies
  that the person you're talking about is dead and that you really miss
  him or her. Inanimate objects can also be lamented, like the
  neighborhood book shop that closed, or a magazine you used to read
  that is no longer in print. The root Latin word is lamentationem,
  which describes wailing, moaning, and weeping.

  In fact, motivation is so essential that researchers have often
  lamented the difficulty of getting accurate performance comparisons
  on cognitive tasks for older and younger participants.

  adjective
   1. начинающий (beginning, starting, novice, catechumen, entering, inceptive)
   2. новообращенный (convert, proselyte, catechumen, novice, converted, neophyte)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a person new to or inexperienced in a field or situation.
      "he was a complete novice in foreign affairs"


  If you're a novice at snowboarding, you're just learning the sport. On
  the Internet, a novice might be called a newbie, but your parents
  would call one a beginner.

  Novice is derived from the Latin word novus, which means new. A novice
  is new to what they do, so a novice photographer is just learning how
  to take nice pictures. Other words related to novice are novel "new,
  unusual," and innovate "to invent, begin with new ideas." Novice can
  also mean a member of a Christian order who has not yet taken their
  vows.

  Anders Ericsson
  argues that experts even see the world differently within their area of
  expertise: they see things that are invisible to a novice; they are able
  to discern patterns at a glance that are anything but obvious to an
  untrained eye; they see details as part of a whole and know at once what
  is crucial and what is incidental.

   2. несовместимость (incompatibility, inconsistency, incongruity, repugnance, antipathy)
   3. неуместность (irrelevance, impropriety, incongruity, ineptitude, impertinence, inaptitude)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the state of being incongruous or out of keeping.
      "the incongruity of his fleshy face and skinny body disturbed her"


  Incongruity means out of place — something that doesn't fit in its
  location or situation. The art show patrons couldn't help but chuckle
  at the incongruity of a toilet sitting in the middle of an exhibition
  of Renaissance paintings.

  An incongruity is very different from everything around it, to the
  point of being inappropriate to the situation. A cat at a dog's
  birthday party would be an incongruity, as would a pacifist at a
  meeting of the War Lovers' Society. Incongruity is the idea that
  something is incongruous, or inappropriate. A purple towel is an
  incongruity in an all black-and-white bathroom.

  It’s fun to home in on that incongruity between the superhuman-seeming
  detective and a failure to grasp a fact so rudimentary that even a child
  would know it.

   4. недоразвитый (underdeveloped, aborted, rudimentary, abortive, neuter, dwarfish)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. involving or limited to basic principles.
      "he received a rudimentary education"


  Rudimentary means basic, or at a very early stage. The test should be
  easy: it requires only a rudimentary understanding of the materials.

  The word rude means simple or offensive––people with only rudimentary
  understanding of good manners might not know how that belching is
  rude. Remember that the word rude is the foundation of rudimentary
  you'll have a rudimentary understanding of the word.

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the amount of something that is permitted, especially within a set of regulations or for a specified purpose.
      "a seventy-five-pound baggage allowance"

  verb
   1. give (someone) a sum of money regularly as an allowance.
      "She spoke of getting travel allowanced but this depended on the social worker who had been assigned and they are not allowed leave their accommodation for more than three days."


  When you're a kid, you might earn an allowance or a sum of money in
  exchange for doing chores around the house. Your parents' allowance —
  or tolerance — of your silly behavior will depend on how strict they
  are.

  An allowance is a quantity of something that's allowed or permitted
  within a set of rules or for a particular purpose. This could be a
  weekly allowance you earn as a kid, or it could be the allowance for
  passengers on a flight to have two carry-on items. To make allowances
  for someone means to treat someone leniently, or to give them a break.

  astronomy in future stories—in “The Musgrave Ritual,” he talks about
  “allowances for personal equation, as the astronomers would have it”; in
  “The Greek Interpreter,” about the “obliquity of the ecliptic”; in “The
  Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans,” about “a planet leaving its
  orbit.”

  Obliquity is a characteristic of being deliberately indirect or vague,
  especially to fool or deceive someone. The obliquity of many
  politicians makes it hard to get a straight answer from them.

  If your teacher comments on the obliquity of your poem, it may be a
  compliment, or it may mean your writing is just hard to understand.
  And while obliquity isn't a bad quality in a poet, it's less desirable
  in a math tutor, or anyone who needs to be straightforward and clear.
  We can trace the origin of obliquity back to the Latin obliquus,
  "slanting, sidelong, or indirect."

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. represent (something) as being larger, greater, better, or worse than it really is.
      "they were apt to exaggerate any aches and pains"


  When you exaggerate you stretch the truth. Fishermen tend to
  exaggerate the size of their fish. And children tend to exaggerate the
  seriousness of their cuts in order to get cute Band-Aids.

  We all have a tendency to exaggerate. It makes our stories funnier, or
  more dramatic. After all, when you exaggerate, you're not really lying
  — you're just overstating things. The word exaggerate can also suggest
  that a particular characteristic is overdone or almost larger than
  life. If you describe someone as having an exaggerated limp, he or she
  might be walking like a gorilla.

  In fact, I would argue that he exaggerates his ignorance precisely to
  draw our attention to a second—and, I think, much more important—point.

   3. неравномерный (uneven, irregular, lopsided)
   4. наклоненный (slanted, bent, lopsided, pitched)
   5. накрененный (lopsided)
   6. однонаправленный (lopsided)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. with one side lower or smaller than the other.
      "a lopsided grin"


  Something that's lopsided is crooked or off-balance, like your
  grandma's lopsided hat, which sits askew on her head.

  You can use the adjective lopsided to describe things that are crooked
  or asymmetrical. A bad toothache might cause one side of your jaw to
  swell, leaving your face feeling — and looking — lopsided. Your might
  say that your school's student council election is lopsided if one
  candidate is clearly more qualified than the other. The word lopsided
  was originally lapsided, and in the early 1700s it almost always
  referred to a tilting ship.

  When I first heard the term brain attic—back in the days of firelight
  and the old crimson hardcover—all I could picture in my seven-year-old

  chimney, and window with open shutters.

   5. вспучиваться (distend)
   6. вспучивать (distend, swell up)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. swell or cause to swell by pressure from inside.
      "the abdomen distended rapidly"


  A soda and pizza binge might make your stomach distend, meaning your
  stomach will swell as a result of pressure from the inside.

  If you’ve ever eaten too much food it won’t surprise you to learn that
  the verb distend traces back to the Latin words dis-, meaning “apart,”
  and tendere, meaning “to stretch.” Your stomach will certainly feel
  stretched out if you do something — like overeat — that causes it to
  distend. The word distend often applies to stomachs — a pregnancy
  would also cause a stomach to distend — but it can also refer to
  anything that is stretched out as a result of internal pressure.

   4. несравнимый (incomparable, disparate, unapproachable)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. essentially different in kind; not allowing comparison.
      "they inhabit disparate worlds of thought"

  noun
   1. things so unlike that there is no basis for comparison.
      "The second class of disparates have more to do with the particular foibles of the aperture involved."


  The trunk of some people's cars may contain items as disparate as old
  clothes, rotting food, and possibly a missing relative. Disparate
  things are very different from each other.

  Near synonyms are unequal and dissimilar. The adjective disparate is
  from Latin disparātus, from disparāre "to separate, divide," from the
  prefix dis- "apart" plus parāre "to prepare." Disparate in the sense
  of "very different" probably developed by association with the Latin
  adjective dispar "unequal, different."

  But whatever it looks like, it
  is a space in your head, specially fashioned for storing the most
  disparate of objects.

   8. способность запоминания (retention)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the continued possession, use, or control of something.
      "the retention of direct control by central government"


  You can use retention to mean the ability to keep or hold. If you have
  extraordinary powers of retention, you remember everything you hear or
  learn.

  Are your ankles ever swollen after a long flight? This comes from the
  lack of movement which can cause the retention of water. The roots of
  the word, Latin re- "back" and tenere "to hold," say it all. You often
  use the word in the military or business contexts to talk about
  keeping soldiers, or employees, from leaving. If you're lucky, they
  might offer you a retention bonus to prevent you from quitting.

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. (of a person) open and responsive to suggestion; easily persuaded or controlled.
      "parents who have had easy babies and amenable children"


  If your friends want to try sky diving and you're amenable to the
  idea, sounds like you're going to be jumping out of a plane. If a
  person or thing is amenable to something, they are ready, willing, or
  responsive.

  Note that amenable is often followed by the preposition to, which
  makes amenable mean "able to be controlled or affected by something,"
  as in "They are usually amenable to our wishes;" or "Her heart
  condition is not amenable to treatment." An amenable personality is
  open to influence or control and is willing to agree or yield.

  adjective
   1. договорный (treaty, contractual, contract, negotiable, contracted, agreed)
   2. подрядный (contracting, contract)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a written or spoken agreement, especially one concerning employment, sales, or tenancy, that is intended to be enforceable by law.
      "both parties must sign employment contracts"

  verb
   1. decrease in size, number, or range.
      "glass contracts as it cools"
   2. enter into a formal and legally binding agreement.
      "the local authority will contract with a wide range of agencies to provide services"
   3. catch or develop (a disease or infectious agent).
      "three people contracted a killer virus"
   4. become liable to pay (a debt).
      "he contracted a debt of $3,300"


  When you and someone else have agreed on something and that agreement
  is both binding and enforceable by law, you have a contract. When you
  rent an apartment, you and your future landlord sign a rental
  contract.

  You can also use the word in this sense as a verb meaning "to hire."
  Wouldn't you like to contract someone to clean your room for you? In
  other verbal uses of contract, place the accent on the second syllable
  — kun-TRAKT. If you contract a disease, you catch it, but only use
  this if it's something serious. You catch a cold, but contract
  malaria. Contract also means "shrink." When the economy contracts,
  consumers stop buying things, and people lose their jobs, and if you
  freeze water, it contracts too.

  It can
  expand, albeit not indefinitely, or it can contract, depending on how we
  use it (in other words, our memory and processing can become more or
  less effective).

   1. a sum of money placed or kept in a bank account, usually to gain interest.
      "Any money market accounts, certificates of deposits , bank bonds, Treasuries, and savings are assets."
   2. a sum payable as a first installment on the purchase of something or as a pledge for a contract, the balance being payable later.

  You are making a deposit when you put money into your bank account. In
  that sentence, deposit is a noun, but you could express the same
  action using deposit as a verb. You deposit money into your bank
  account.

  The verb deposit can be used to refer to anything that you put down or
  in place. If you're carrying your keys and groceries from the car, you
  may deposit those items on the counter. Just be careful you don't end
  up playing "where are my keys" in the morning, if the counter is not
  your usual place for depositing them. You can also use deposit when
  nature does the placing. You find a deposit of gold in the mountain
  rock or there is sediment deposited at the bottom of a river.

   1. границы (scope, confines, ambit, purview, purlieus)
   2. ограничения (confines)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. keep or restrict someone or something within certain limits of (space, scope, quantity, or time).
      "he does not confine his message to politics"

  noun
   1. the borders or boundaries of a place, especially with regard to their restricting freedom of movement.
      "they were cramped within the confines of a little cabin"


  If you spend a lot of time in the same four block radius, you could
  say those streets make up your confines. Confines means an area with a
  clear boundary.

  Think of confines as a confined or restricted space. The fact that
  there is a boundary is the important part of this word. You might say
  that things said in the confines of your office should not be shared,
  or suggest that your parents get out of the confines of their
  residential development a little more often. It is always used in the
  plural in this sense.

  At the end, it will have to remain
  within certain confines—each attic, once again, is different and subject
  to its unique constraints—but within those confines, it can take on any
  number of configurations, depending on how we learn to approach it.

** Translate from English to Russian:                                 :drill:

 unduly
*** --->
  чрезмерно

  adverb
   1. чрезмерно (excessively, overly, overmuch, over, unduly, prohibitive)
   2. незаконно (unduly, illegitimately)
   3. неправильно (wrong, improperly, amiss, unduly, awry, fallaciously)


  If something is done unduly, it's done out of proportion with what's
  reasonable or right. If you're unduly treated, you're not treated in
  the way you deserve to be.

  Duly comes from the late 14th century duweliche meaning "rightly,
  properly." The prefix un-, meaning "not" of course reverses that
  meaning so with unduly we get "not rightly or properly." You might
  become unduly angry with a toddler for tracking mud into the house.
  Unduly can also mean "excessively." Worrying unduly about the future
  can be paralyzing. Sometimes it's good to take the days as they come.

  We can, however, learn to master many aspects of our attic’s structure,
  throwing out junk that got in by mistake (as Holmes promises to forget
  Copernicus at the earliest opportunity), prioritizing those things we
  want to and pushing back those that we don’t, learning how to take the
  contours of our unique attic into account so that they don’t unduly
  influence us as they otherwise might.
* lather :Holmes:

** Translate from English to Russian:                                 :drill:

 lather
*** --->
  намыливать

  verb
   1. намыливать (lather, soap)
   2. вспениваться (foam, froth, lather)
   3. намыливаться (lather)
   4. бить (beat, hit, strike, pound, smash, lather)
   5. пороть (flog, thrash, trounce, flagellate, lather, lace)
   6. взмыливаться (lather)
   7. мылиться (lather)
   8. колотить (pound, beat, bash, baste, whack, lather)

  noun
   1. мыльная пена (lather, suds, soapsuds)
   2. пена (foam, froth, scum, lather, head, spume)
   3. мыло (soap, foam, lather)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a frothy white mass of bubbles produced by soap or a similar cleansing substance when mixed with water.
      "Almost 60 per cent of water was wasted in washing of excess lather from the clothes."

  verb
   1. (with reference to soap or a similar cleansing substance) form or cause to form a frothy white mass of bubbles.
      "soap will not lather in hard water"
   2. rub soap onto (a part of the body) until a lather is produced.
      "she was lathering herself languidly beneath the shower"
   3. cause (a horse) to become covered with sweat.
      "his horse was lathered up by the end of the day"
   4. cover something liberally with (a substance).
      "she lathered a slice of toast with butter"
   5. thrash (someone).


  A lather is the froth soaps and detergents produce. Lathering also
  means to soap yourself up, and a lather can be a state of extreme
  agitation.

  When you're taking a shower, you make the soap frothy: this is a
  lather, and you're lathering when you create it. Rubbing soap on your
  body is also called lathering. Since lather is a stirred-up form of
  soap, it can also apply to emotions that have been stirred up. Someone
  upset is in a lather. Getting in a lather usually results from worry
  or anger, and it's an unpleasant state of mind.

* alter :Holmes:
[2018-05-15 Tue 14:23]

After eating too many gingerbread cookies, she no longer fit into her
uniform, so she had a seamstress alter it. It looked pretty much the
same.

The verb alter can also mean to neuter or spay. Think of a cat that
has just been spayed: the cat you pick up from the vet is the same cat
that you dropped off there, only perhaps a little groggy and unable to
reproduce. While the cat has been altered, it's not a different cat.

The basic structure may be there for good, but we can learn to alter its
exact linkages and building blocks—and that alteration will actually
rebuild the attic, so to speak, rewiring our neural connections as we
change our habits of thought.
* alteration :Holmes:
[2018-05-15 Tue 14:24]

The pants are too long, the jacket too tight and the vest is too
short. Looks like your suit is in need of some serious alteration, or
adjustment.

No one knows alterations like tailors. All they do is adjust, modify
and otherwise alter people's ill fitting clothes. But hemlines aren't
the only things that can undergo alteration. Savvy scientists may
someday make alterations to genetic sequencing — just like Dr. Jekyll
underwent some serious alterations to become Mr. Hyde.

The basic structure may be there for good, but we can learn to alter its
exact linkages and building blocks—and that alteration will actually
rebuild the attic, so to speak, rewiring our neural connections as we
change our habits of thought.
* attendant :Holmes:
[2018-05-15 Tue 14:28]

An attendant is someone present at a meeting or event. A flight
attendant, for example, tends to the needs of passengers on a plane
trip.

The word attendant has to do with being present. An attendant on a
flight is present to help you if you need anything. An attendant event
is one that happens in the presence of another event. In other words,
it can mean "accompanying." An illness can have attendant symptoms
that go along with it. Remember that the word ends in -ant.

“It reminds me of the circumstances attendant
on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year ’34.
* acquainted :Holmes:
[2018-05-15 Tue 14:29]

When you're acquainted with someone, it means you know each other. If
you're taking the city bus and realize that you know several of your
fellow riders, you could say, "I'm acquainted with half of the
passengers on this bus."

As long as you know something or someone fairly well, you are
acquainted with it, so you can be acquainted with a city, a
mathematical idea, or a particular poem. The trickiest thing about the
word acquainted is the way it's spelled. Like the words acquit and
acquire, you just have to keep in mind that a c needs to go before the
qu. After you've spelled it several times, you'll be well acquainted
with the correct spelling.

Presumably,
both men had at one point been acquainted with the circumstances—after
all, Gregson has had to train extensively for his current position—and
yet the one has retained them for his use, while for the other they have
evaporated into nonexistence.

Though the rats’ motor function declined and some
had to hobble or crawl their way woozily through the twists and turns,
the animals never altogether forgot their way, leading Lashley to
conclude that there was no single location that stored a given memory.
* nevertheless :Holmes:
[2018-05-16 Wed 08:30]

A funny-looking adverb that appears to be made up of three words
squished together, nevertheless means “even so" or "all the same.”

It’s likely that nevertheless evolved from the Middle English
neverthelater, a word with the same sense of “despite anything to the
contrary” and “notwithstanding.” You might say of your siblings, "Sure
we bicker and get sick of each other sometimes. Nevertheless, they’re
family and I love them."

Our attic’s structure and contents aren’t there because we
have to think that way, but because we’ve learned over time and with
repeat practice (often unknown, but practice nevertheless) to think that
way.
* ado :Holmes:
[2018-05-16 Wed 08:38]

Someone who makes a lot of ado about things has a tendency to make
them more busy or complicated than they need to be.

A flurry of activity or a lot of complaining about a little problem
are both examples of ado. It's an old fashioned word, dating back to
the fourteenth century, when it meant "conflict or trouble." "At do"
was a Norse version of the English phrase "to do," which was
eventually shortened to ado. The most famous use of the word is
probably the Shakespeare play "Much Ado About Nothing."

And without further ado, Holmes
departs for Lauriston Gardens, Watson at his side.
* directives :Holmes:
[2018-05-16 Wed 08:46]

A directive is an order or official notice that comes from an
authority. The directive from your boss instructing all employees to
wear silly hats on Fridays might be hard to take seriously.

Directives often come from employers, governments, supervisors,
judges, or other authority figures. A math teacher might issue a
directive to all students banning smart phones in the classroom after
the school principal releases a directive instructing all math
teachers to find ways to cut down on cheating during exams. Directive
is also an adjective, meaning "helping to guide or manage."

From there,
the stuff that you either actively consider important or that your mind
somehow decides is worth storing, based on past experience and your past
directives (i.e., what you normally consider important), will be moved
to a specific box within the attic, into a specific folder, in a
specific compartment in the cortex—the bulk of your attic’s storage
space, your long-term memory.
* ramble :Ferris:
[2018-05-16 Wed 09:27]

You ramble when your talking or your walking goes on and on and on.
And on. You’re in no hurry to make a point or get to your destination
— if there is one at all.

The word ramble comes from similar roots as roam. They both mean
wander, but they’re often used a little differently. You might roam
around on vacation to relax or find adventure. If you’re a shark, you
roam the deep sea for food. On the other hand, if the person on the
plane next to you chatters nervously and can’t stop, you wish they
wouldn’t ramble on like that.

Do not let people ramble.
* belabor :Ferris:
[2018-05-16 Wed 09:28]

Belabor means to go at something with everything you've got. When you
say, "Don't belabor or agonize over the decision," it means, "Move
on."

Belabor is made up of the Latin roots be and labor meaning "to exert
one's strength upon." You can belabor a point by using excessive
detail, or you could belabor the obvious by stating over and over what
everyone already knows. Belaboring can be a physical attack as well. A
person can belabor or beat the living daylights out of you with a
club.

I belabor this point enough.
* permissible :Ferris:
[2018-05-16 Wed 09:30]

If something is permissible, then it is allowed. If it's not
permissible then you probably shouldn't be doing it.

If someone asked you, "Is it permissible for me to have a cupcake?"
they're asking very formally for your permission to dig in. Usually
the word permissible has to do with laws, rules, and what's generally
acceptable. It's not permissible to take your pants off in public, for
example. Wearing a hat inside is permissible according to the law, but
it's not permissible according to church customs or your grandma's
rules.

Send them an e-mail
with new rules as bullet points: number of permissible phone calls,
e-mail response time, minimum orders, etc.
* leashes :Ferris:
[2018-05-16 Wed 09:32]

Dog owners who live in the city need a leash, a rope or cord attached
to the dog's collar that helps his owner keep him safe and restrained.

When you walk a dog, you hold his leash to guide him along the
sidewalk and keep him from chasing squirrels into busy streets. The
word leash is also useful for describing a figurative kind of guide or
restraint: "The teachers at that school keep their students on a short
leash when they take field trips downtown." The students aren't on
actual leashes, but they are constrained. Leash comes from the Old
French word laissier, or "loose."

Take at least one day off of digital leashes per week.
* miffed :Ferris:
[2018-05-16 Wed 09:33]

When you're miffed, you're offended or annoyed. It would be hard not
to feel miffed if your entire family forgot your birthday.

The informal miffed is great for describing a feeling of irritation or
impatience. Your teacher might be miffed if you keep showing up late
to class, and you'll feel equally miffed if he doesn't believe your
excuse that the bus is always late. Miffed came along in the early
nineteenth century, from miff, "fit of ill humor," which is probably
imitative of the disgusted sound you might make when you're fed up or
offended.

As one reader put it to a miffed co-worker who worked 24/7
and expected the same: “I’m not the president of the U.S.
* hellion :Ferris:
[2018-05-16 Wed 09:38]

A hellion is someone who makes mischief or gets into trouble. You
might refer to the kids you babysit as a bunch of hellions if they
regularly refuse to go to bed, instead staging massive pillow fights.

Hellion almost always describes a young person, often a child, who
raises a ruckus or makes trouble in some rowdy way. The little boy
next door might have most people fooled into thinking he's an angel,
but you'll know he's a hellion when you spot him jumping off the roof
into a pile of snow or putting firecrackers in your mailbox. Hellion
is an American word, inspired by the Scottish hallion, or "scamp."

For my parents,
DONALD AND FRANCES FERRISS,
who taught a little hellion that marching to a different drummer
was a good thing.
* wage :Ferris:
[2018-05-16 Wed 09:40]

If your job pays a good wage, it means that you earn a lot of money
for the hard work you do. If you're not happy with your wage, you
might have to wage war on your boss.

Wage is one of those words whose verb and noun forms have entirely
different meanings. A worker's wage is how much money she makes. But
when you wage something, you carry it out: for example, a warmonger is
someone whose primary goal is to wage wars. The word is of Germanic
origin, and it's related to both gage and wed, with their underlying
meanings of "to pledge."

Whether you’re a wage slave or a Fortune 500 CEO, this
book will change your life!”
* vagabonds :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 09:29]

A vagabond is someone who moves around a lot. Picture Boxcar Willie,
bandana on a stick thrown over his shoulder, going wherever the breeze
takes him.

Vagabond can also be an adjective, a nomadic tribe is a vagabond one,
or the person who moved eight times in two years is living a vagabond
life. It's from the Latin word vagabundus (from vagari, "wander")
which means "inclined to wander." So — if you were born a ramblin'
man, you might just be a vagabond.

CEOs and professional vagabonds?
* playground :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 09:43]

A playground is a place to frolic and play. Most kids know where the
nearest playground is because that’s where the swings and slides are.
Neighborhoods and schools usually have a playground. Weeeeee!

A playground built especially for kids has equipment for them to play
on, like climbing structures, swings, seesaws, and play houses. Many
public parks have this kind of playground. When adults talk about
their favorite playgrounds, they usually mean a place they go to do
the sports or activities they love. A nearby mountain, for example,
could be described as a playground for snow boarders.

It’s an experimental playground for those who
want better results in less time.
* alternatives :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 09:47]

When you're facing a fork in the road, you have two possibilities, or
alternatives. You could take the left fork and see where it leads, or
you could choose the path that goes to the right.

Whenever there is an alternative, it involves a choice. A wealthy
student has the choice of going to a public school, or the
alternative, a private school. Alternative can also refer to a
different way of doing things, outside the norm. You might say that a
hermit who lives in remote a cave with a pet turtle is living an
alternative lifestyle.

People are
open to exploring alternatives (and more forgiving of others who do the
same), as many of the other options—the once “safe” options—have failed.
* dabble :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 09:51]

You dabble when you are a little bit involved in an activity, such as
an art form or a hobby. Maybe you only dabble in mystery novels, but
you are very knowledgeable about comic books.

The word dabble can also often relate to water. It can mean “to splash
playfully,” or “to get just a little wet.” A bird can also dabble in
water by dipping its bill into it. Each of these meanings of dabble is
often followed by the word in. For example, a duck may dabble in the
water (and then dribble a few drops afterward from its bill), and you
may dabble in shrubbery art.

This period of collective panic is your big chance to dabble.
* deferred :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 09:55]

Defer means to put off or delay. You can try to defer the inevitable
by pushing “snooze” and falling back asleep, but eventually you're
going to have to get up.

If you're excellent at pushing things to a later date and a master at
procrastination, then you already know how to defer. But defer can
also mean to comply with another person’s opinion or wishes. So when
your boss finds out you deferred your work to shop online instead, you
should probably defer when she asks you to come in and finish
everything up over the weekend.

This book is for anyone who is sick of the deferred-life
plan and wants to live life large instead of postpone it.
* objective :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 09:56]

An objective is something you plan to achieve. A military objective is
the overall plan for a mission. The objective for a bake sale is to
raise money. If your objective is to learn a new word, you have
succeeded.

An objective is the point of something. If you don’t understand the
objective of a class, then you don’t know what you were supposed to
learn. The word itself is often used in business or work. Another
meaning of objective is “looking at things in a detached, impartial,
fact-based way.” If a police officer falls in love with a witness, it
might be hard for her to stay objective. The word comes from the Latin
ob "against" + jacere "to throw.”

The objective is to create freedom of time and
place and use both however you want.
* majority :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 10:01]

Majority means “most of,” or the biggest part. Does the majority of
what owls eat — mice, rats, squirrels, moles — sound appetizing to
you? If not, you’re probably in the majority of people.

In an election, victory usually goes to whoever wins the majority of
votes, or more than half of them. The opposite of majority is
minority. A majority of the more than one billion Roman Catholics in
the world live in Latin America; a small minority of all Roman
Catholics live in Asia.

Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to
pause and reflect.
* reflect :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 10:01]

Something that reflects comes back to you. If you look in a mirror,
you will see your reflected image. If you reflect on your past
experiences, you look at them once again thoughtfully.

Reflect also means to give evidence of the character or quality of
something. Most parents want their children to reflect their own
strengths by emulating their behavior. A set of telling statistics
could reflect the buying trends in an economic cycle. Reflecting can
mean seeing something original in another form or image.

Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to
pause and reflect.
* fidgeting :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 20:19]

To fidget is to make little movements with your hands and feet. Even
if you're nervous during your job interview, try not to fidget.

The word fidget is related to the Old Norse fikja, meaning "move
briskly, be restless or eager." If you are feeling impatient or
anxious you might fidget in your seat or fidget with a pen in your
hands. A person who fidgets a lot can be referred to as a fidget and
so can that quick anxious movement itself.

I adjusted my pin-striped suit and fussed with my blue silk
handkerchief until it was obvious that I was just fidgeting.
* chaperone :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 20:20]

High school dances always have at least one chaperone to keep an eye
on things. A chaperone is someone who looks after and supervises
another person or a group of people.

Chaperone can also be spelled chaperon, without the e. It originally
meant a woman whose duty was to accompany a younger woman and make
sure she wasn't harmed and didn't get into trouble, especially when
she was with a man. These days, chaperone is most often used to
describe an adult who supervises a group of kids or teenagers. The Old
English meaning was "protective hood or head covering," and today the
word chaperone retains that "protective" quality.

Our chaperone had done his job, and now it was
our turn.
* undulating :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 20:21]

Undulate means to move in a wave-like pattern. If a sound increases
and decreases in pitch or volume like waves, you can say the sound is
undulating. When searching for the lost boy, the rescuers' cries
undulated through the forest.

The verb undulate comes from the Latin word undula, which means
"wavelet" (unda means "wave"). So any action shown with the verb
undulate has that waving sense to it. If something moves in a wavy,
pattern, for example, it is said to undulate. The wind might cause
prairie grass to undulate, or music might cause hips to undulate.

Through the thick haze of cigarette smoke, you could
barely make out the huge undulating mass in the stands, and everywhere
there was exposed floor, except the sacred 30′ × 40′ space in the middle
of it all.
* fathom :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 20:22]

To fathom something is to understand it thoroughly, and is usually
used in the negative, as in "I can't fathom why he doesn't want to go
along with us."

Fathom is from Middle English fadme, from Old English fæthm
"outstretched arms." The Old English and modern English noun also
refers to a unit of length used to measure the depth of water. To
understand something thoroughly is "to get to the bottom of it."

It was hard to even fathom 50,000 spectators
and coordinators in La Rural, even if it was the biggest exhibition hall
in Buenos Aires.
* drudgery :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 20:29]

If you’ve ever had to do the laundry, wash the dishes, make the meals,
change the bedding, vacuum the house, and clean the bathrooms day
after day, you’ve experienced drudgery. Drudgery is hard, mindless,
backbreaking work.

When you say the word drudgery, you can almost feel the hard, plodding
work that it describes. You have to put some effort into saying the
dr- sound. Then, as soon as you get through the breathy -u-, you’ve
got two more hard sounds in -dg- and -er- before you get another break
with the final vowel sound. Just as you might drag yourself doing
those repetitive, grinding chores, you have to drag your way through
pronouncing the word.

Most people, my
past self included, have spent too much time convincing themselves that
life has to be hard, a resignation to 9-to-5 drudgery in exchange for
(sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional
keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation.
* sleight :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 20:30]

The noun sleight refers to being able to use your hands with ease,
especially when doing a trick. Sleight is often used in the phrase
"sleight of hand." If you are a good magician, you can make a coin
disappear with sleight of hand.

The noun sleight refers to cunning or cleverness, especially when used
to trick or deceitfully. You can use a sleight of mind to trick
yourself into believing that if you eat a box of cookies at dinnertime
it counts as dinner. The word sleight with its meaning as being sneaky
has a long history and comes from the Middle English word, sleghth,
which also meant cunning. Back then people would have pronounced the
"gh" even though today we don't.

From leveraging currency differences to outsourcing
your life and disappearing, I’ll show you how a small underground uses
economic sleight-of-hand to do what most consider impossible.
* seize :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 20:45]

Infomercial salesmen constantly tell you to seize the opportunity to
buy their product while you still can. Supplies are limited! After
all, everyone will want that solar-powered puppy petter, so you'd
better grab the opportunity and buy two!

You can seize all kinds of things. Seize the day if you are taking
advantage of the present circumstances and enjoying life to the
fullest. Seize the castle, if you are a feudal lord fighting with your
neighbor. Seize the inspiration if you want to tell a moving story.
Seize authority if you are overthrowing a small country. Avoid, at all
costs, being seized if you are under zombie attack.

This book will
teach you how to see and seize the options others do not.
* famine :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 20:46]

A famine is a severe shortage of food, but not the "I forgot to go to
the grocery store and there's nothing to eat in the house" type of
shortage. A famine is usually caused by crop failure or disaster.

Although the "extreme shortage of food" meaning is most common, the
noun famine can also mean any shortage or insufficiency, and it is
often used idiomatically in the phrase "feast or famine." This usage
refers to something that is alternately plentiful and scarce — like
the feast and famine experienced by an artist who only occasionally
sells his paintings.

I’m going to
assume you are suffering from time famine, creeping dread, or—worst
case—a tolerable and comfortable existence doing something unfulfilling.
* Liberation :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 20:52]

Liberation means the setting free of someone or something. Wild
animals raised in captivity are often unprepared for their liberation
when they are released back into the wild.

You'll notice right off the bat that liberation is related to the noun
liberty — as in "liberty and justice for all." The difference is that
liberation refers specifically to the act of being made free, of going
from having no freedom to having it. Famous moments of liberation
include Europe's liberation from the Nazis, the slaves' liberation
from slavery in the U.S., and South Africa's liberation from the
oppression of apartheid.

Liberation is not about cheap
travel; it is about forever breaking the bonds that confine you to a
single location.
* flawless :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 20:52]

Flawless is an adjective that means "without any imperfections," like
your flawless vocal performance — not one mistake. That's why the
choir teacher gave you an A+.

In flawless you can see the word flaw, which means "a fault." So
something that is flawless is free of faults, perfect. If you've never
gotten in any kind of trouble, your record is flawless. Antique car
collectors look for that flawless model — no dents, dings, or signs
that anyone had even sat in it.

The
concept of mini-retirements is introduced, as are the means for flawless
remote control and escaping the boss.
* lateral :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 20:55]

When something is extending to the side or moving to the side, it’s
lateral. "All of the lateral movement in tennis hurt her knees and she
had to quit playing."

The adjective lateral comes from the Latin word lateralis, which means
“belonging to the side” and the modern meaning is basically the same.
In anatomy, views of the body from the left, as well as from the right
are referred to as lateral. You can make a lateral career move, if the
compensation and level of responsibility stay about the same (instead
of moving up, you are moving to the side). A lateral pass in football
is one that goes to the side or behind the passer, instead of directly
towards the goal.

Resolve now to test
the concepts as an exercise in lateral thinking.
* asylum :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 21:06]

When someone needs a refuge from a difficult or dangerous situation,
they need asylum. If a government offers to protect people who have
fled war or hardship in their own country, it gives them asylum.

You may have heard asylum used to describe an institution where insane
people are housed, but did you know that an asylum can also be
somewhere you’d happily and willingly go? An asylum offers shelter and
protection, like the awning of a building in a downpour. Or it could
be a country that takes in refugees in danger of persecution —
otherwise known as "political asylum."

Political asylum researcher and activist
* parlor :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 21:09]

A parlor is a living room or a sitting room, the place in your house
with comfortable chairs and sofas. You might also decide to put your
giant new TV in the parlor.

The noun parlor is an old-fashioned one. Still, almost anyone would
know what you meant if you invited them to join you in the parlor for
tea. These days, a hotel, inn, or historic house is more likely to
have a parlor than a private home is. The thirteenth century version,
parlur, meant "room in a monastery for holding conversations." The
"conversations" part stems from parler, "to speak" in French.

I’m hired for minimum wage as the
cleaner at an ice cream parlor and quickly realize that the big boss’s
methods duplicate effort.
* trump :Ferris:
[2018-05-18 Fri 21:26]

To trump is to outrank or defeat someone or something, often in a
highly public way. Safety might trump appearance when you're buying a
car, or your desires may trump your brother's when it comes to making
weekend plans.

In the card game bridge, the trump card is the most powerful card in a
particular round and defeats all the others — sort of like when your
needs or wishes trump someone else's. Originally trump implied a
deceptive form of victory involving cheating, but that sense has been
largely lost, though it's still around in the term trumped up, meaning
something that's been falsely made up. A politician may face trumped
up charges that could ruin his career.

Despite the hottest
job market in the history of the world, I manage to go jobless until
three months after graduation, when I pull out my trump card and send
one start-up CEO 32 consecutive e-mails.
* retards :Ferris:
[2018-05-19 Sat 15:18]

To retard something is to slow it down. A lack of fresh fruit and
vegetables can retard the growth of a young child.

This word should be used with a lot of caution. Calling someone who's
mentally retarded — or of low intelligence — a retard is considered
very offensive by many people. That use should be avoided. On the
other hand, this is a harmless word when used as a verb. While skiing,
a heavy, bulky jacket could retard your progress down the mountain.
Keeping a plant out of sunlight would retard its growth. When you see
retard, think slow and "Use with caution."

I ask him in the most tactful way possible why we are doing
it like retards.
* freaking :Ferris:
[2018-05-19 Sat 15:20]

Freak is a not-so-nice noun that refers to either a person who
expresses such an intense obsession with something that it resembles
addiction, or a person or animal that is monstrous and deformed.

Synonyms for freak, when used to describe something or something
abnormal, include anomaly, chimera, misshape, and oddity. Weirdo is
slang for freak, and regular is its antonym. People who ardently adore
a particular type of music, like heavy metal, or who have many
piercings or identify with a subculture, are often labeled freak. A
freak occurrence, on the other hand, is not necessarily a bad thing,
but connotes something irregular or unexpected. A freak of nature can
lead to thunder-snow, and a freak accident can lead to, well, a
missing ear or toe.

I take a one-week “vacation” to Florence, Italy, with my
family and spend 10 hours a day in an Internet café freaking out.
* implodes :Ferris:
[2018-05-19 Sat 15:22]

When something implodes, it explodes inward — instead of outward. With
extremely large buildings, it helps to implode them rather than
explode them, because by falling inward they take up less space.

Why bother to have a word like implode when you already have explode?
Well, imagine there is something deep beneath the sea, being subjected
to the intense pressure there. If the pressure is high enough that the
object bursts, it would collapse in rather than out. It would, in
fact, implode. People also sometimes use implode to describe a person
subjected to intense pressures who, emotionally at least, bursts
inward: "All that stress just made Jess implode."

June 2004 I decide that, even if my company implodes, I need to escape
before I go Howard Hughes.
* impoverished :Ferris:
[2018-05-19 Sat 15:26]

Impoverished describes being really, really poor, either from having
no money or being in bad health. A person who lives on the street is
impoverished, and a country may become impoverished after a
devastating war.

Impoverished comes from the Old French word povre, which means “poor,”
and you can almost see the word poverty inside impoverished. Living an
impoverished life means that your finances and health are not in good
shape, and in fact you could die because you can’t support yourself. A
corrupt and greedy government makes its citizens impoverished, and too
much pollution will create impoverished soil that isn’t healthy enough
to grow delicious vegetables.

I also have in mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly
impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how
to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or
silver fetters.
* dross :Ferris:
[2018-05-19 Sat 15:27]

Things that are a total loss — really worthless or damaging — are
dross. That gunk between your teeth that comes out when you floss? You
could call that dross. No one wants it, and it's harmful if it stays.

While dross is a noun for stuff that's physically left over or
useless, like the nonmetallic stuff left when metal gets refined, it's
also used for people and forms of art. A really bad movie can be
called dross, and a low or despicable person can be dross. Debris, or
trash, is another form of dross. "Searching the backyard for
unexploded fireworks — the dross of Chinese New Year celebrations —
was a tradition for the kids and a safeguard for the dogs."

I also have in mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly
impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how
to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or
silver fetters.
* fetters :Ferris:
[2018-05-19 Sat 15:28]

A fetter is a shackle or chain that is attached to someone’s ankles.
To fetter someone is to restrict their movement, either literally or
metaphorically. You might feel fettered by your parents' rules, even
without the chains.

A fetter is anything that secures and limits the movement of the feet
and legs of a prisoner. To fetter, the verb, could be used literally:
the prison wardens would fetter the chain gangs who built many of the
railroads in the US., but it usually means something has been done to
restrain someone’s behavior: "we finally managed to fetter our sons’
computer use with bribery."

I also have in mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly
impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how
to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or
silver fetters.
* pursue :Ferris:
[2018-05-19 Sat 15:50]

Use the verb pursue when you're chasing after someone or something. A
hungry lion might pursue a zebra, the paparazzi might pursue a
celebrity, and a young dancer might pursue her dream of becoming a
prima ballerina.

Pursue originally meant "to follow with hostile intent," from a Latin
root word, prosequi, "follow, accompany, follow after, or follow up."
Today, when you pursue someone, it's not necessarily with bad
intentions. A police officer, for example, might pursue a criminal,
and your dog might pursue your cat around the house just for fun. If
you pursue a career in journalism, you are working to achieve it.
Likewise, you pursue a strategy or a hobby if you do it consistently.

The goal is not to
simply eliminate the bad, which does nothing more than leave you with a
vacuum, but to pursue and experience the best in the world.
* errand :Ferris:
[2018-05-19 Sat 15:50]

An errand is a short trip to fulfill some small business. When you’re
running errands, you’re making a bunch of these all at once.

The noun errand can refer to the mission of the trip itself. If the
lines are always long at the bank, then banking may be your least
favorite errand. If you are off on a wild goose chase, you may be out
on a fool's errand. If you are taking food or clothing to someone in
need, then you are on an errand of mercy.

The blind quest for cash is a fool’s
errand.
* sneak :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 16:46]

The word sneak has many shades of meaning, but all involve doing
something in a secretive or stealthy way. If you sneak home after
midnight, that means you’re quietly creeping into the house so no one
will hear you.

In addition to moving furtively, sneak can also mean doing something
secretly or slipping something in. You might sneak a cookie when no
one is looking, or you might sneak your brother into a concert. You
could even sneak a glance at that cute guy in your math class — you do
it when you think no one will notice. Sneak has a noun form that
describes a furtive person — someone who does a lot of sneaking.

They sneak in if we’re not careful, if we just
passively take in information and don’t make a conscious effort to
control our attention (something we’ll learn about a bit further
on)—especially if they are things that somehow pique our attention
naturally: topics of general interest; things we can’t help but notice;
things that raise some emotion in us; or things that capture us by some
aspect of novelty or note.
* pique :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 16:47]

The verb pique means to make someone angry or annoyed. But when
something piques your interest or curiosity, here the verb pique just
means to arouse, stimulate, or excite.

Both the noun and verb are pronounced "pēk" and were borrowed from a
French word meaning "a prick, irritation," from Old French, from
piquer "to prick." So you can see how something that pricks you could
make you both excited and angry. But it's frustrating––enough to make
you want to storm away from learning vocab. That storming away, by the
by, might be called a "fit of pique."

They sneak in if we’re not careful, if we just
passively take in information and don’t make a conscious effort to
control our attention (something we’ll learn about a bit further
on)—especially if they are things that somehow pique our attention
naturally: topics of general interest; things we can’t help but notice;
things that raise some emotion in us; or things that capture us by some
aspect of novelty or note.
* sundae :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 16:49]

A sundae is a delicious ice cream concoction that might include hot
fudge or caramel sauce, nuts, and whipped cream. You can order a
sundae any day of the week.

When you put ice cream in a dish, drip a sweet topping over it (like
strawberry sauce or chocolate syrup), and add a dollop of whipped
cream and a cherry, you've got a sundae. There are several competing
stories about the origin of the sundae (and its name). One is that
Illinois' outlawing of soda drinking on Sundays led to the dessert's
invention. Several towns claim to be the sundae's birthplace,
including New York City; Plainfield, Illinois; and New Orleans.

I’m not a sundae type of guy.
* stuffed :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 16:54]

If something is stuffed, it's packed full of material, like the giant
stuffed rabbit you won at the country fair. If a person is stuffed,
she's had too much to eat.

You might sit back after eating an entire pizza and murmur, "I'm
stuffed." If you're stuffed up, you've got a bad cold and your head is
stuffed with mucous. When objects are stuffed, it's usually because
they're full of stuffing, like a stuffed armchair or a stuffed animal.
It was once common to insult someone who was pompous but ineffectual
by calling him a "stuffed shirt."

It’s not as simple as getting one discrete
item out whenever I want it just because I once stuffed it up there.
* cues :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 20:54]

A cue is the long stick used for playing pool. A cue is also a
reminder or stimulus to do something.

In pool, you use the cue to hit the white ball into the red ball,
aiming for a pocket. Other cues make things happen too. In acting, a
lighting change or another actor's line could be a cue for you to
enter the stage. During rehearsal, the actors need to learn their cues
to make sure their timing is right. A cue can also be a clue or
reminder of something. Anytime someone has good timing, they're on
cue.

What’s more, the
more cues we have, the better the likelihood of successful retrieval.
* solace :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 20:57]

If something eases your disappointment or grief, consider it a solace.
If you're sad, you might find solace in music or in talking to your
friends.

It is no surprise that consolation and solace are similar in meaning
as they share a root in the Latin verb sōlārī "to comfort." In fact,
solace and consolation are synonyms meaning relief from grief or
disappointment. When you go to sleepaway camp, your parents will miss
you, but they'll find solace in knowing that you are having fun.

And so the detective takes solace, to Dr.
* dismay :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 20:58]

If you discover late Sunday night that the dog really did eat your
homework, you might cry out in dismay. Dismay describes an emotional
state of alarm, fear, or serious disappointment.

The first part of dismay comes from the Latin prefix dis-, which comes
in handy when you want to put a negative spin on words (dishonest,
discount, disenchant, etc.). The last bit of dismay most likely comes
from the Germanic word magan, meaning "to be able to." You can employ
the word dismay to describe how you feel in a variety of negative
situations that you doubt you are able to handle.

Watson’s great dismay, in the 7 percent solution: cocaine.
* roused :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 20:58]

When someone calls out "rise and shine," they are trying to rouse you,
to make you wake up.

It's thought that the word rouse was originally a 15th-century term
used by hawkers for the way the birds shook out their feathers when
agitated. That gives a nice mental picture to the word, and it does
fit: rouse means to become awake, excited, or just plain keyed up,
like those birds ruffling their feathers. Consider that when first
roused in the morning, many people have to shake themselves to get
ready to face the day.

“Your brain
may, as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and
morbid process which involves increased tissue-change and may at least
leave a permanent weakness.
* morbid :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 20:59]

If the first section of the newspaper you read is the obituaries, you
could be considered morbid. Morbid is a word used to describe anyone
who spends too much time thinking about death or disease.

A lot of English words relating to medicine and science come from
Latin, and the adjective morbid is one of them; it comes from the root
morbidus, meaning "diseased" or "sick." Morbid can also be used to
describe other nouns besides people. If you wear Goth clothing, your
wardrobe might be described as morbid. And if you hang tombstones on
your walls, your taste in art could also be described as morbid.

“Your brain
may, as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and
morbid process which involves increased tissue-change and may at least
leave a permanent weakness.
* abstruse :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:01]

Abstruse things are difficult to understand because they are so deep
and intellectually challenging. It might be hard to figure out how a
toilet flushes but the technology that goes into making the Internet
function is abstruse.

The Latin roots of the word abstruse are about concealing or hiding
something, which is a good way to remember the meaning of this word.
It is useful when describing something that is overly confusing, or if
someone is deliberately making a story or a situation more complicated
than necessary. It sounds and looks like obtuse, but abstruse is
almost its opposite. Obtuse is dull or lacking a sharpness of
intellect. While Abstruse is president of the chess club, Obtuse is
hanging out by the parking lot smoking cigarettes.

“Give me problems, give me work, give me the
most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis,” he says, “and
I am in my own proper atmosphere.
* dispense :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:02]

To dispense means to give out or distribute something. A school nurse
can dispense students' medication and we all can dispense advice.

The word dispense comes from the Old French word dispenser, meaning
"give out." You can dispense anything from hand sanitizer to dating
advice. When dispense is paired with with it means "get rid of it" or
"skip." If you dispense with traditional Thanksgiving dishes, you
might instead celebrate with pizza, pancakes, tacos — anything but
turkey and all the fixings.

I can dispense then with artificial
stimulant.
* abhor :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:03]

If you abhor something, it gives you a feeling of complete hatred.
Chances are you abhor that kid who used to torture the frogs in
biology class.

Abhor is from Latin abhorrere — "to shrink back in horror." It is the
strongest way in English to express hatred, even stronger than loathe.
We only use abhor in formal contexts; you might say "I abhor that
man," but you would be less likely to say "I abhor spinach" unless you
tend to express yourself in highfalutin terms no matter what the
occasion.

But I abhor the dull routine of existence.”
* crisp :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:06]

Something that's crisp is thin, dry, and breakable. Unless they're
stale, most crackers are crisp.

Gingersnaps are crisp, and so is toast — in fact, crisp often
describes food, although crunchy snow and dry, brown leaves are also
crisp. To crisp something is to cook or dry it until it's brittle, and
when a voice is crisp, it's abrupt and no-nonsense. A crisp fall
morning is fresh and cold. In Old English, crisp meant "curly," from
the Latin crispus, "curled." The "brittle" definition is probably
imitative, the word sounding like its meaning.

A
crisp knock on the door, and the men’s landlady, Mrs.
* dainty :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:06]

Dainty means tiny, delicate, and lovely, so you could describe a
little china tea set as dainty, and you could also call the tiny cakes
on the little plates dainty.

The original meaning of dainty, back in the 1300s, was "choice morsel
of food," and it's still used that way to talk about a delicacy or a
treat. More often, dainty is used as an adjective to describe
something that's delicate and lovely. It's a compliment, unless it's
used sarcastically to mean "someone who acts ridiculously prissy." An
example would be to say, "Sorry I hurt you when I barely brushed
against you. I didn't realize you were so dainty."

She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and
dressed in the most perfect taste.
* plainness :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:07]

There was, however, a plainness and
simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited
means.
* amiable :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:08]

A friendly, pleasant person could be described as amiable. Airline
flight attendants tend to be amiable. The people monitoring the
school's cafeteria? Maybe not.

An amiable person is good-natured and easy to get along with. Add one
letter and you get amicable, a word with a common ancestor (Latin
amicabilis) and a similar meaning. But while amiable refers to
friendly people, amicable refers to friendly relations between them;
two amiable people who no longer want to be married to one another
might have an amicable divorce.

Her face had neither regularity
of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and
amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and
sympathetic.
* demeanor :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:13]

Your demeanor is defined as being either your facial appearance or
your behavior. When playing poker, don't let your demeanor give away
how good your cards are.

Demeanor in English today has evolved from Middle English and Old
French to refer to the way one manages or presents oneself, and this
definition applies to conduct as well as facial expressions. The way
you present yourself often affects how others make judgments about you
and therefore, you might want your demeanor to reflect the situation
you're in. So, if you're at a birthday party, your demeanor should be
happy and smiling!

self-confident?—based on his appearance and demeanor
alone.
* impending :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:14]

If something is impending, it is about to happen. If you hear thunder
in the distance, you might go inside to escape the impending storm.

The word impending often refers to something threatening or
frightening: impending doom, impending disaster. Something that is
impending hangs over you — you might say, "I was so distracted by
thoughts of my impending failure in my exams, I couldn't study." A
synonym is imminent.

Or, maybe Joe Stranger is actually Jane Stranger and her hair is
dyed the same shade of blue as your childhood best friend dyed her hair
right before you stopped talking to each other, and you always thought
the hair was the first sign of your impending break, and now all of a
sudden, all of these memories are clogging your brain and coloring the
way you see this new person, innocent Jane.
* clogging :Holmes:

Or, maybe Joe Stranger is actually Jane Stranger and her hair is
dyed the same shade of blue as your childhood best friend dyed her hair

* errant :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:16]

Something or someone described as errant has gone astray or done wrong
by going in an unexpected direction. An errant bird might end up in
northern Canada while his friends fly to southern Mexico for the
winter.

Although errant is commonly used as a synonym for "misbehaving" or
"naughty," it also refers to things that are just out of place. An
errant bomb can hit a house instead of an army base, and an errant
lock of hair can get in your eyes. Errant can be intentional, as in
"the errant boys skipped school to go to the movies," or
unintentional, as in "an errant snowball hit your neighbor instead of
your arch enemy."

You only
happened to remember your ex–best friend, for instance, because of an
errant streak of hair.
* immune :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:29]

To be immune to something is to be resistant to it. If you had
chickenpox as a child, you should be immune to it now.

The adjective immune comes from the Latin word immunis, which means
“exempt from public service.” If you're protected — or exempt — from
disease, injury, work, insults, or accusations, then you're immune.
Vaccinations serve to make people immune to certain diseases. Being a
diplomat makes people immune to certain legal persecution. To be
immune to bullying means that you don’t let the bad behavior of your
peers get you down.

Hardly anyone is immune altogether.
* cast :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:41]

A cast is the group of actors who make up a film or stage play. And
the act of being chosen for the part? Well, they were cast by the
director. That's showbiz for you.

Cast also refers to various types of actions a person can take: if you
throw out a fishing line in a particular way, you are said to cast it;
if you fancy your chances in Vegas, you cast the dice at the craps
table. And if you break a limb and they bandage it up in solid plaster
for your friends to write all over? That, too, is a cast.

You can recognize their presence, and
then consciously cast them aside.
* bantering :Holmes:
[2018-05-19 Sat 21:44]

Bantering is how you can describe clever chit-chat. If you are out to
flirt or impress, using a bantering tone is always a good bet.

There's generally a flirtatious element implied if the banter is
between a man and a woman, but anyone can banter. Most male buddy
movies consist of nothing more than bantering dialogue. If you really
want to impress that waiter or waitress with your fancy vocabulary,
try saying "How do you like my persiflage?" It's a fancy name for
banter. Of course, they may hit you over the head if they don't
understand, but that's the risk of using a bantering tone.

After all, he is already in a relaxed, happy mood, bantering in typical
fashion with his detective flatmate.
