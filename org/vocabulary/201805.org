  [voluntarily], ride their bikes with their friends [voluntarily], and

  the Latin root voluntarius, "of one's free will."

  added, so [awareness] is the state of being aware, or having knowledge
  of something. Its roots are Germanic, and come from the Old English
  wær meaning "wary, cautious." [Awareness] can be something you notice,
  want to tell others about, or already know. You could "raise
  [awareness]" of a cause, like fighting breast cancer. Yet, your
  [awareness] of the baby sleeping next door might prevent you from
  having band practice in the garage. Smart move.

  While [apparently] can mean "plainly" — like, duh — it can also mean
  "seemingly," which is almost "evidently" or "obviously," but not
  quite. There's a certain amount of guessing involved, based on
  appearances. The park ranger who shows up in the morning to examine
  the path of destruction through your campsite might say that it was
  "[apparently] the work of a hungry bear," not because he's totally
  sure, but because it definitely looks like something the bears
  around here would do.

  When you say the word [drudgery], you can almost feel the hard,
  plodding work that it describes. You have to put some effort into
  saying the dr- sound. Then, as soon as you get through the breathy
  -u-, you’ve got two more hard sounds in -dg- and -er- before you get
  another break with the final vowel sound. Just as you might drag
  yourself doing those repetitive, grinding chores, you have to drag
  your way through pronouncing the word.

  [Abhor] is from Latin [abhor]rere — "to shrink back in horror." It is
  the strongest way in English to express hatred, even stronger than
  loathe. We only use [abhor] in formal contexts; you might say "I [abhor]
  that man," but you would be less likely to say "I [abhor] spinach"
  unless you tend to express yourself in highfalutin terms no matter
  what the occasion.

  who has no hesitation about starting up a new relationship before

  which originally meant "to make effeminate." By the late 1800s, the

  Anything [intrinsic] comes from within. Doing a job for only money is
  not [intrinsic]. Doing a job because you love it is [intrinsic]; the
  motivation comes from within. It's good to treat people as having
  [intrinsic] value. If you like someone for [intrinsic] reasons, then you
  have no other motivation. The opposite of [intrinsic] is extrinsic,
  for things that come from the outside instead of from the inside.

  In Latin, extra means outside, as in extraordinary "outside the
  ordinary," or extraterrestrial 'coming from outside earth.' (Bonus
  points––ding! ding!––if you knew that terra is Latin for "earth.")
  The meaning of [extraneous] also extends to more abstract things that
  come from the outside: [extraneous] details are ones that don't
  matter.

  situations that involve being totally unaware of what's staring us
  right in the face. It can also mean being forgetful and
  absent-minded. The cartoon character Mr. Magoo is a perfect example
  of someone who is [oblivious]; his eyesight is so bad that he always

  [Volition] comes from Latin and French roots meaning "wish" or "will."
  Legal speech and writing often include the word [volition], as a way
  to affirm that a person involved in a crime acted "on their own
