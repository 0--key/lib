  noun
   1. an act or the sound of expelling air from the nose in a sneeze.
      "he stopped a sudden sneeze"

  verb
   1. make a sudden involuntary expulsion of air from the nose and mouth due to irritation of one's nostrils.

  When you sneeze, you blow air forcefully (and involuntarily) out of
  your nose and mouth, possibly while making a sound that might be
  spelled "achoo!" Allergies, pepper, and dust are all famous for making
  people sneeze.

  Behind every sneeze is some kind of irritant, a foreign substance that
  bothers the mucous membranes inside your nose. Pollen, cat dander, and
  the inflammation of your nose caused by a cold virus can all cause a
  sneeze (or several sneezes). When you sneeze, muscles in your face,
  neck, and chest contract reflexively. In rare cases, very bright
  lights or eating a large meal can make people sneeze. Go figure!

 tiered
*** --->
  многоуровневого

  verb
   1. располагать ярусами (tier, tier up)


  Something that is arranged in a series of levels or layers is tiered.
  Towering wedding cakes are often tiered, with the smallest layer at
  the very top.

  Stadium or theater seating is tiered — each row of seats is placed
  slightly above the row in front of it, so that people sitting in the
  back can see over the heads of the audience members in front. Skirts
  and dresses sometimes have tiered ruffles, each layer a bit higher
  than the one beneath it. The adjective tiered comes from tier, or
  "row," from the Old French tire, "rank or sequence."

  Because
  microservices are primarily modeled around business
  domains, they avoid the problems of traditional tiered
  architectures.

  noun

   2. западня (trap, snare, pitfall, mantrap, pit, mesh)
   3. волчья яма (pit, pitfall)
   4. рытвина (pothole, gully, hollow, pitfall, delve)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a hidden or unsuspected danger or difficulty.
      "He bought some books on self-publishing and brushed up on the perils and pitfalls involved."


  A pitfall is a trap or difficulty you didn't see. A possible pitfall
  for high school seniors is not working hard after they know they've
  already been accepted into college.

  In 1300, pitfall referred to an animal trap, such as branches laid
  across a deep hole offering no escape. Since the 1580s, pitfall has
  come to describe any hidden or unexpected difficulty, and its meaning
  has expanded to apply to humans. You might encounter a pitfall when
  trying to use a brand new computer program that's unexpectedly
  precise. It can even be a habit you don't want to address, like the
  pitfalls of snacking in front of the television every night.

  Microservices also integrate new
  technologies and techniques that have emerged over the
  last decade, which helps them avoid the pitfalls of many
  service-oriented architecture implementations.

   3. проникновенный (profound)

   4. океан (ocean, pond, deep, blue, main, profound)
   5. пучина (abyss, gulf, depth, profound, abysm, vortex)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. (of a state, quality, or emotion) very great or intense.
      "profound social changes"
   2. (of a person or statement) having or showing great knowledge or insight.
      "a profound philosopher"
   3. at, from, or extending to a great depth; very deep.
      "he opened the door with a profound bow"

  noun
   1. the vast depth of the ocean or of the mind.


  When you need a word that's deeper than "deep," consider profound.

  Profundus meant literally "deep" in Latin, and profound had the same
  meaning when it entered English in the 14th century. But even then, it
  also meant "figuratively deep" — that is, very great or intense: "The
  new laws have had a profound impact." Of people, it means "very
  knowledgeable or insightful," but sometimes if a person tries to sound
  profound they're really just giving you superficial knowledge dressed
  up with big words.

  Although the idea is not new
  (even if the term itself is), experiences from people all over the
  world, along with the emergence of new technologies, are having a
  profound effect on how they are used.

   7. замешанность (implication)
   8. то, что подразумевается (connotation, implicate, implication)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the conclusion that can be drawn from something, although it is not explicitly stated.
      "the implication is that no one person at the bank is responsible"
   2. the action or state of being involved in something.
      "our implication in the problems"


  An implication is something that is suggested, or happens, indirectly.
  When you left the gate open and the dog escaped, you were guilty by
  implication.

  Implication has many different senses: Usually used in the plural,
  implications are effects or consequences that may happen in the
  future. You might ask, "What are the implications of our decision?"
  Implication is also the state of being implicated, or connected to
  something bad: "Are you surprised by their implication that you were
  involved in the crime?"

   technology implications, as we discuss what sorts of service

   2. рыться (rummage, delve, burrow, scrabble, rummage about, rummage in)
   3. копать (dig, delve, excavate, peck, shovel, scoop)

   1. впадина (cavity, depression, hollow, trough, valley, delve)
   2. рытвина (pothole, gully, hollow, pitfall, delve)
   3. шурф (pit, hole, delve)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. reach inside a receptacle and search for something.
      "she delved in her pocket"


  The verb delve means to dig into, loosen, or investigate. She delved
  into her family's history and discovered an inventor, a checkers
  champion, and a circus equestrian in her ancestry.

  Delve has a literal meaning of to dig into the earth ("to delve the
  soil," as in preparing a garden, for example), but this sense is rare
  now. The verb is most often used in the more figurative sense — like
  to delve into a problem or into someone's personal life.

  noun
   1. наследие (heritage, legacy, inheritance, patrimony, heirloom, hangover)
   2. наследство (inheritance, heritage, legacy, patrimony, bequest, residue)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. an amount of money or property left to someone in a will.
      "Bentham tells the family that they are about to inherit a legacy from a relative."

  adjective
   1. denoting software or hardware that has been superseded but is difficult to replace because of its wide use.
      "Then new projects that could have gone with the legacy platform start going to the new one."


  Use the word, legacy, for something handed down from one generation to
  the next. A retiring company president might leave a legacy of honesty
  and integrity.

  Legacy comes from the Latin verb, legare "to appoint by a last will,
  send as an ambassador." Originally, the noun meant "ambassador" or
  "envoy" but soon shifted to mean the money and property a person
  leaves behind in his will. Many university scholarships are funded by
  the legacies of former students. In recent usage, political leaders
  are said to be concerned with their legacies, the historically
  significant achievements of their tenure in office.

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. pressed firmly together, in particular.
      "The impacted , partially air-filled material was seen in the distal esophagus."
   2. strongly affected by something.
      "grandiose planning projects have had deleterious effects on impacted social groups"

  verb
   1. come into forcible contact with another object.
      "the shell impacted twenty yards away"
   2. have a strong effect on someone or something.
      "high interest rates have impacted on retail spending"


  If your doctor tells you that something is impacted, that's not a good
  thing. It means wedged together and unable to move.

  Wisdom teeth are often impacted, which makes one question how wise
  they actually are. A fractured bone can be impacted as well, which
  means the two broken ends are wedged together. Perhaps you could say
  that your Christmas stocking is so jam packed and impacted with
  goodies that you can barely pull anything out — but that's about the
  only non-painful association with the word imaginable.

   7. отвлеченный (abstract, notional, abstractive, discrete)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. individually separate and distinct.
      "speech sounds are produced as a continuous sound signal rather than discrete units"


  Discrete means separate or divided. A discrete unit is a separate part
  of something larger. A room is a discrete space within a house, just
  as the crankshaft is a discrete part of a car engine.

  If something is discrete, it has its own space. An ice cube comes from
  an ice tray, but it has its own discrete compartment. A student
  government might have discrete committees for different projects.
  Don't confuse discrete with its close cousin discreet, which means
  “appropriately private.” Billionaire Bruce Wayne, for example, is very
  discreet about his secret life as Batman. You could say Batman is a
  discrete, or separate, part of Bruce Wayne’s identity. Anything
  distinct and separated is discrete.

  This chapter goes deep into the topic of testing, an area of
   particular concern when handling the deployment of multiple

   8. спрямлять (align, aline, square up)
   9. строиться (align, fall in, parade, troop, aline, form)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. place or arrange (things) in a straight line.
      "gently brush the surface to align the fibers"
   2. give support to (a person, organization, or cause).
      "newspapers usually align themselves with certain political parties"


  To align means to bring something into a straight line, or an easy
  agreement. If you always park on an angle and people are leaving mean
  notes on your windshield, learn to align the car with the parking
  space.

  Align comes from the French a, meaning "to" and ligne meaning "line,"
  and it means to bring something into line with something else. This
  can be literal. If you are hanging a painting, you'll want to align it
  with the window frame. The line can also be metaphorical. If you run
  for office, your political opinions will need to be aligned with those
  of your supporters.

  We’ll attempt to

   5. выдавать замуж (marry, marry off, give in marriage, wed, espouse, match)
   6. признавать (confess, accept, recognize, admit, acknowledge, espouse)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. adopt or support (a cause, belief, or way of life).
      "he turned his back on the modernism he had espoused in his youth"
   2. marry.
      "Edward had espoused the Lady Grey"


  Use the verb espouse to describe the actions of someone who lives
  according to specific beliefs, such as your friends who espouse
  environmentalism and as a result walk whenever possible instead of
  taking the car.

  You can see the word spouse in espouse, so you may be wondering what
  husbands and wives have to do with it. Originally espouse did mean "to
  marry," but its meaning has evolved to include other long-term
  commitments as well, such as support for a principle or a cause.
  Similar to marriage, if you espouse a belief system, the idea is that
  you've chosen to wed yourself to it.

  Some large, successful organizations like Amazon
  and Google espoused the view of small teams owning the full lifecycle
  of their services.

  adverb
   1. сосредоточенно (intently)

  DEFINITION

  adverb
   1. with earnest and eager attention.
      "he gazed at her intently"


  If you're studying something intently, you're probably leaning forward
  and you're oblivious to whatever is going on around you. Your
  attention is focused like a laser.

  If you're gazing intently into someone's eyes, you're hanging on to
  every blink of the eye, every nuance of expression. Maybe you're in
  love. When you do something intently, you do it with intensity. It's
  not a coincidence that intently sounds a lot like intensity, as they
  both come from the Latin intendere, made up of in- ("toward") and
  tendere ("stretch"). So when you're listening intently to a Bartók
  string quartet, you're stretching and straining to hear every note.

   2. the temporary cessation or suspension of something.
      "The Applicant has set in motion an appeal from the disciplinary panel to an appeal panel but that appeal has been put into suspense by reason of his application for judicial review."


  Suspense is a feeling of excited waiting. If you have been waiting for
  weeks to get an answer to your proposal of marriage, you are being
  kept in suspense.

  The verb form, suspend, literally means to keep hanging. Suspense can
  be used in all sorts of ways. Movies that keep you on the edge of your
  seat in fear use suspense to draw you in. Suspense doesn’t always have
  to be scary, but it is usually agitating. If you are in suspense,

  A faculty refers to any of your mental or physical abilities. If you
  lose your faculties, you are powerless. The faculty of a school is
  comprised of the people who work there. Lose them, and you have a
  different kind of problem.

  Faculty comes from the Old French word faculté, which means “skill,
  accomplishment, or learning.” You may have great faculties of memory,
  sight, mobility, charm, math, and musicality, but, as Beethoven was in
  the end, be robbed of your faculty of hearing. Any aptitude or ability
  — inborn or learned — that you have is a faculty. Also, if you go to
  school, your teachers make up the faculty of that school.

  An education which should
  improve this faculty would be the education par excellence.”

 voluntarily
*** --->
  добровольно

  adverb
   1. добровольно (voluntarily, mere of motion, of one's own free will)

  DEFINITION

  adverb
   1. of one's own free will.
      "many restaurants voluntarily removed it from their menus"


  Use the adverb voluntarily to describe something you do willingly. For
  example, you might voluntarily stay home and babysit your little
  brother if the alternative is a trip to the grocery store.

  People do things voluntarily when they are completely willing to do
  them, not forced or enticed by anyone else. Kids tend to eat candy
  voluntarily, ride their bikes with their friends voluntarily, and
  watch their favorite shows on TV voluntarily. It's easy to see the
  connection with the verb to volunteer, and both words are rooted in
  the Latin root voluntarius, "of one's free will."

  As early as
  the end of the nineteenth century, William James, the father of
  modern psychology, wrote that “the faculty of voluntarily bringing
  back a wandering attention, over and over again, is the very root of
  judgment, character, and will.

  adjective
   1. ощутимый (tangible, palpable, perceptible, appreciable, sensible, tactile)
   2. осязаемый (tangible, palpable, touchable, tactile)
   3. очевидный (evident, obvious, apparent, demonstrable, visible, palpable)
   4. явный (explicit, obvious, apparent, sheer, evident, palpable)
   5. прощупываемый (palpable)
   6. ощутительный (palpable, appreciable)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. able to be touched or felt.
      "the palpable bump at the bridge of the nose"


  When something is palpable, you can touch or handle it, even though
  the word is often used to describe things that usually can't be
  handled or touched, such as emotions or sensations.

  You probably won't see palpable used to describe, say, an egg or a
  doorknob or a motorcycle. Palpable is usually reserved for situations
  in which something invisible becomes so intense that it feels as
  though it has substance or weight. When the towers came down, the
  sense of sadness was so great, it was palpable.

  When we
  are forced to do multiple things at once, not only do we perform
  worse on all of them but our memory decreases and our general
  well-being suffers a palpable hit.

  noun
   1. осознание (awareness, realization, perception, knowing)
   2. осведомленность (awareness, knowledge, information, conversance, privity, info)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. knowledge or perception of a situation or fact.
      "we need to raise public awareness of the issue"


  Awareness is the state of knowing something, such as the awareness
  that the sun comes up every morning.

  The adjective aware gets turned into a noun when the suffix -ness is
  added, so awareness is the state of being aware, or having knowledge
  of something. Its roots are Germanic, and come from the Old English
  wær meaning "wary, cautious." Awareness can be something you notice,
  want to tell others about, or already know. You could "raise
  awareness" of a cause, like fighting breast cancer. Yet, your
  awareness of the baby sleeping next door might prevent you from having
  band practice in the garage. Smart move.

  The adverb blithely describes something you do in a casually cheerful,
  somewhat neglectful way, like when you blithely ride your bike down
  the street, not even thinking about all the homework you have to do.

  Something that's done blithely is careless, like a group of kids
  blithely dashing off across a frozen pond on their ice skates,
  forgetting about their slower friend. You could talk blithely about
  your brand new laptop, forgetting that your friend can't afford a new
  computer. Blithely also means "happily," without implying that
  anything is being overlooked or ignored, like a winning team blithely
  celebrating their victory.

  We sail on, blithely unaware of how much we are missing, of
  how little we grasp of our own thought process—and how much better we
  could be if only we’d taken the time to understand and to reflect.

  noun
   1. тяжелая походка (plod)
   2. тяжелый путь (plod)
   3. тяжелая работа (heavy work, drudgery, slog, fag, elbow grease, plod)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. walk doggedly and slowly with heavy steps.
      "we plodded back up the hill"

  noun
   1. a slow, heavy walk.
      "he settled down to a steady plod"


  When you plod, you walk slowly, heavily, and deliberately. You might
  need to plod through the snow to get to the bus stop on time.

  Plod evokes a difficulty in walking — like when you trudge through mud
  or walk slowly up a steep hill. You might plod home at the end of a
  long day, or plod through an overgrown field on a hot afternoon. You
  can also use plod figuratively, to mean "work on something boring or
  monotonous." The origin of plod is unknown, but it may have come from
  the sound of feet on the ground — the sound you make when you plod.

  Like Watson, we plod along the same staircase tens, hundreds,
  thousands of times, multiple times a day, and we can’t begin to
  recall the most mundane of details about them (I wouldn’t be
  surprised if Holmes had asked about color instead of number of steps
  and had found Watson equally ignorant).

  Engender is a fancy way of saying "to make happen," like when you
  engender the spirit of teamwork and cooperation by encouraging others
  and doing your share of the group's work.

  The verb engender has nothing to do with being male or female, though
  originally, it did mean "beget, procreate." Today, engender means "to
  produce or bring about." When students come to class prepared, meaning
  they've read their assignment, this engenders better class
  discussions, just as mutual trust and the desire to help each other
  engenders a meaningful friendship.

   3. occur with or as a result of.
      "people feared that the switch to a peacetime economy would be attended by a severe slump"


  The verb attend means to be present, to listen, or give care or
  attention to. You can attend your family reunion, attend to a project
  you've been ignoring, or attend to your teacher's voice.

  When you use attend as "pay attention" or "take care of," it's
  followed by "to." When you use attend as in "attend a party," you
  don't. If you attend a political rally, you'll want to attend to what
  the politicians have to say. When you take attendance, you are
  checking which students have chosen to attend class, i.e. who is in
  attendance.

  never a good idea, unless you want inedible food or a kitchen fire.

  The verb deviate can refer to divergence from a predicted path or road
  ("the airplane's route deviated from the flight plan"), but it can
  also refer to a divergence from normal behavior or expectations. When
  women demanded the right to vote, their behavior was considered
  shocking and deviated from the expectations of the time.

  Have you ever had a light shine in your face so you couldn't see for a

  car's high-beam lights can dazzle other drivers. Looking directly at

  The nifty thing about dispel is that you can use it when talking about
  emotional problems (such as worries and fears) as well as physical
  ones (such as wild dogs). Note, however, that when dispel is used in
  reference to physical foes, it often has the added meaning of
  scattering your opponents in all directions. So, while you can dispel
  a pack of wild dogs, you should just chase off or drive away a lone
  wolf. Good luck with that, by the way.

  If something is hostile, it's unfriendly. If you are zealous about the

  Hostile comes from the Latin word hostis, for enemy, and you can hear

  animals, like bats and fireflies, who sleep during the day and come
  out to play when the sun goes down. The opposite of nocturnal is

  To maim something is to disfigure it through force or violence.
  Wartime battles have a tendency to maim soldiers.

  The verb maim is related to mayhem, which, historically, was the act
  of hurting another person so badly that they couldn’t defend
  themselves. To maim a person or animal, even if it’s an accident, is
  to render them defenseless or disfigured, and it frequently includes
  the loss of a limb. The goal of driving defensively is to avoid an
  accident that could maim you, your passengers, or other people on the

  verb
   1. kill (animals) for food.
      "When I say meat, I do mean slaughtered animals killed for food."


  Slaughter refers to the killing of large numbers of animals or people.
  When cattle are old enough, they're sent to slaughter and their meat
  is processed and shipped to stores.

  The noun slaughter was first used in the 1300s and comes from the Old
  Norse word slahtr, which also described the mass killing of animals or
  people. A verb form came along later, in the 1530s. You might hear
  slaughter used to describe the killing of large numbers of people in a
  war, a genocide, or a massacre. It also can be used figuratively to
  describe a crushing defeat, like the slaughter of your basketball team
  by your bitter rivals.

  In the spring of 1907, Edalji was finally cleared of the charge of
  animal slaughter.

  investigations, not for the purpose of finding out who was the guilty
  party, but for the purpose of finding evidence against Edalji, who
  they were already sure was the guilty man.”

 miscarriage
*** --->
  выкидыш

  noun
   1. выкидыш (miscarriage, abortion, abortive, misbirth, miss)
   2. ошибка (error, mistake, fault, flaw, fallacy, miscarriage)
   3. неудача (failure, fail, bad luck, bad, setback, miscarriage)
   4. недоставка по адресу (miscarriage)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the expulsion of a fetus from the womb before it is able to survive independently, especially spontaneously or as the result of accident.
      "his wife had a miscarriage"
   2. an unsuccessful outcome of something planned.
      "the miscarriage of the project"


  A miscarriage, in medical terms, is the birth of a fetus before it's
  able to live independently of its mother. In other words, a
  miscarriage is the abrupt, early end of a pregnancy.

  The medical sense of miscarriage, which usually describes the very
  early loss of a pregnancy (later losses are often called stillbirths),
  is actually among the newer uses of the word. In the sixteenth
  century, a miscarriage was almost always a "mistake or error" or
  sometimes "misbehavior." Today, when something doesn't go the way it
  was supposed to, you might call it a miscarriage.

  And in August of that year, England saw the creation of its first
  court of appeals, to deal with future miscarriages of justice in a
  more systematic fashion.
* impetuse                                                           :Holmes:
[2018-05-05 Sat 09:13]

An impetus is the force behind something, whether it's a boulder
rolling down a hill or a person making a decision.

Very little would get done if there were no such thing as an impetus:
an impetus is some kind of force that gets something or somebody
moving. If you push a car that's out of gas, you're the impetus that's
getting it moving. An impetus doesn't have to be physical. Advertisers
hope their commercials will be an impetus to buy the product.

The Edalji case was widely considered one of the main impetuses behind
its creation.

  adjective
   1. утомительный (tedious, tiring, tiresome, exhausting, weary, wearisome)
   2. изнурительный (exhausting, grueling, wearisome, backbreaking, tiring, wasting)
   3. скучный (boring, dull, tedious, blah, uninspired, wearisome)
   4. наводящий тоску (depressing, wearisome)
   5. изнуряющий (harassing, exacting, wearisome)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. causing one to feel tired or bored.
      "It would be wearisome to go into any more detail."


  Anything that's boring, tedious, or so dull that it puts you to sleep
  can be described as wearisome. Long bus rides and long classroom
  lectures can both be wearisome.

  The adjective wearisome is good for describing things that seem to
  last forever, that require repetition, or that are otherwise both
  boring and mentally exhausting. Always being told "Be careful!" by
  your parents can be wearisome, and typing data into a computer all day
  is also wearisome. The original, fifteenth century meaning of
  wearisome was "weary" or "tired," but it quickly came to mean "making
  one weary," from the Old English root werig, "tired."

  “I shall not mention the name which must have become wearisome to
  your ears,” Meredith told Conan Doyle, “but the creator of the
  marvellous Amateur Detective has shown what he can do in the life of
  breath.”

   3. затасканный (hackneyed, hack, trite)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. (of a remark, opinion, or idea) overused and consequently of little import; lacking originality or freshness.
      "this point may now seem obvious and trite"


  When you want to indicate that something is silly or overused, you
  would call it trite. A love song with lyrics about holding hands in
  the sunshine? Totally trite.

  Trite has a Latin root, the past participle of terere, meaning "wear
  out." An old-fashioned or outdated definition of the word is "frayed
  or worn out by use," and you can see how the meaning for an object
  that is worn out can be applied to an idea that has been used to the
  point of being meaningless. The antonym of this word is original.

  Another somewhat trite answer I can give is small enough and no
  smaller.

   1. a person who inspires or influences others, especially one prominent in a particular sphere.
      "one of the luminaries of child psychiatry"
   2. an artificial light.
      "We offer an exciting range of lighting and luminaries that have the ability to accentuate, to harmonize, to enhance, and to convey a mood."


  In scientific writing, Stephen J. Hawking is a luminary. People look
  up to this well-known scientist and author for his knowledge and
  insight.

  Although luminary can mean an object or celestial body that gives off
  light, you'll often hear people talk about parties at which there were
  many luminaries in attendance. In this case, luminary means celebrity
  or well-known person in sports or politics, science or the arts. Think
  of them as being bright lights that make a party sparkle.

  Perhaps William Gillette or Basil Rathbone or
  Jeremy Brett or any number of the luminaries who have, over the
  years, taken up Holmes’s mantle, including the current portrayals by
  Benedict Cumberbatch and Robert Downey, Jr.

   1. a risky or daring journey or undertaking.
      "pioneering ventures into little-known waters"

  verb
   1. dare to do something or go somewhere that may be dangerous or unpleasant.
      "she ventured out into the blizzard"


  A venture is a risky undertaking. If your latest venture is a dog food
  store, you hope there are some hungry dogs around. Also, to venture is
  to go somewhere possibly dangerous, like if you venture out into a
  snowstorm.

  Venture is a shortened form of adventure. This happened sometime
  between 1100 AD and 1400 AD during the time that Middle English was
  spoken. While the two words are similar in meaning, when you subtract
  the "ad," you lose a teaspoon or two of fun, and add a heaping
  tablespoon of risk.

  Whatever the pictures your mind brings up, I would venture to guess
  that the word psychologist isn’t one of them.

   1. a person or thing competing with another for the same objective or for superiority in the same field of activity.
      "he has no serious rival for the job"

  verb
   1. compete for superiority with; be or seem to be equal or comparable to.
      "the efficiency of the Bavarians rivals that of the Viennese"


  A rival is a competitor or contender that you want to defeat, whether
  in an actual competition or for another goal. It may be a tennis rival
  or a rival for your true love’s affections.

  There are all types of rivals, but they tend to show up a lot in
  sports. For example, in college football, the Army and Navy have been
  rivals since their first meeting in 1890. Something that is able to
  rival something else is seen as comparable to it in quality, and
  something that is said to be “without rival” is unmatched, or better
  than everything else.

  But his insights
  into the human mind rival his greatest feats of criminal justice.

      "this was an issue transcending party politics"


  It would be nice to transcend the narrow limits of this brief
  definition, and go to greater lengths to describe this word's glories!
  Transcend means to move upward and beyond something.

  No doubt you know about the words transcontinental or maybe trans
  fats? The prefix trans is used to mean "beyond, across" and transcend
  takes this even farther by adding in a sense of upwardness with the
  stem cend. A pop artist with a lot of talent might transcend the genre
  of pop. You can't assume a person's opinion on national security by
  party affiliation — it often transcends party lines.

  It is an approach born out of the scientific method that transcends
  science and crime both and can serve as a model for thinking, a way
  of being, even, just as powerful in our time as it was in Conan
  Doyle’s.

      "his ubiquitous influence was felt by all the family"


  It's everywhere! It's everywhere! When something seems like it's
  present in all places at the same time, reach for the adjective
  ubiquitous.

  "Cities like Singapore aim to cloak themselves in ubiquitous, free
  Wi-Fi in the next few years," The Wall Street Journal reported
  recently — meaning that those savvy Singaporeans will find a wireless
  connection everywhere they go. The word, comes from the Latin ubique,
  meaning — you guessed it — "everywhere." The usual pronunciation is
  "yoo-BIK-wih-tihs," but Joseph Heller must have had the older variant
  "ooh-BIK-wih-tihs" in mind when he wrote in Catch-22 that a character
  "padded through the shadows fruitlessly like an ubiquitous spook."

  And that, I would argue, is the secret to
  Holmes’s enduring, overwhelming, and ubiquitous appeal.

      "the fever was a somber presage of his final illness"

  verb
   1. (of an event) be a sign or warning that (something, typically something bad) will happen.
      "the outcome of the game presaged the coming year"


  A presage is a sign that something bad is about to happen, like when
  you get that queasy feeling in your stomach because your mom found out
  you skipped band practice to go to the movies.

  Presage, pronounced "PREH-sige," can be a noun or a verb. As a noun,
  presage is a warning or omen of bad things to come, like a strange
  quiet and stillness in the air, presage to the coming tornado. As a
  verb, presage means "making a prediction or giving a warning of what's
  to come," like a terrible end-of-season football game's outcome game
  that presaged the struggles the team faced the next season.

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. instill (an attitude, idea, or habit) by persistent instruction.
      "the failures of the churches to inculcate a sense of moral responsibility"


  To inculcate is to teach through frequent instruction. If you
  repeatedly tell your brother how important it is to be responsible,
  then you’re trying to inculcate in him a sense of responsibility.

  The word inculcate traces back to the Latin word inculcare, meaning
  “to force upon or to stamp in.” If anyone has even tried to inculcate
  you with something, it may seem as if something is being stamped into
  your brain — over and over and over. A key thing to remember about
  this word is repetition: something, such as a value or a belief, is
  instilled in the brain by the persistent restating of its importance.

  As Conan

  observation which I have heard you inculcate, I have tried to build

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a confusing and difficult problem or question.
      "one of the most difficult conundrums for the experts"


  The tricky word conundrum is used to describe a riddle or puzzle,
  sometimes including a play on words or pun.

  One of the most famous conundrums is the riddle of the Sphinx,
  famously in the play Oedipus the King by Sophocles. Oedipus encounters
  the Sphinx, a mythical beast, who asks him, "What walks on four legs
  in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three in the evening?" The
  answer is "A person": crawling as a child, walking as an adult, and
  using a cane in old age. The scary thing is that if the Sphinx asked
  you the riddle and you didn't know, she'd eat you!

  midnight or working late.

  Deem comes from the Old English word, deman — meaning "act as a
  judge." If you deem something, you essentially become the judge of
  whether it has a characteristic. For example, if you deem your little
  sister's jokes to be too ridiculous to listen to, you will probably

  can also mean not relevant or essential, like all the extraneous
  information in your long-winded science report.

  In Latin, extra means outside, as in extraordinary "outside the
  ordinary," or extraterrestrial 'coming from outside earth.' (Bonus
  points––ding! ding!––if you knew that terra is Latin for "earth.") The

  Apparently is an adverb meaning "evidently" or "obviously." After his
  sixth hot dog, you might say to your friend, "Well! Apparently
  somebody was hungry!"

  While apparently can mean "plainly" — like, duh — it can also mean
  "seemingly," which is almost "evidently" or "obviously," but not
  quite. There's a certain amount of guessing involved, based on
  appearances. The park ranger who shows up in the morning to examine
  the path of destruction through your campsite might say that it was
  "apparently the work of a hungry bear," not because he's totally sure,
  but because it definitely looks like something the bears around here
  would do.

  Before you even begin to ask the questions that will define the

      "the disposal of his shares in the company"
   3. the arrangement or positioning of something.
      "she brushed her hair carefully, as if her success lay in the sleek disposal of each gleaming black thread"


  Disposal means getting rid of something, or throwing it away. When you
  go on a picnic, be sure to have a bag for the disposal of your trash
  afterward, or you will be a terrible litterbug.

  You can use a garbage disposal, a grinder in your sink drain that
  allows you to wash down certain waste items without causing clogs, for
  the disposal of vegetable scraps. In addition to meaning "getting rid
  of something," disposal can also mean "the power or means to
  accomplish something." If you have a fleet of limousines at your
  disposal, it's easy to get a large number of guests to a wedding.

  Consternation is a noun that can stop you in your tracks because it
  means "a sudden, alarming amazement or dread that results in utter
  confusion; dismay."

  If you have a sense of consternation you have become afraid,
  disoriented, or completely befuddled. It comes from the Latin roots
  con- and -sternare, which means "spread out." Picture all of your
  thoughts strewn about, nothing makes sense and you might experience a

   1. восторг (delight, enthusiasm, rapture, admiration, elation, exaltation)
   2. приподнятое настроение (elation, ginger)
   3. бурная радость (elation)
   4. энтузиазм (enthusiasm, passion, ardor, steam, elation, will)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. great happiness and exhilaration.
      "Richard's elation at regaining his health was short-lived"


  If you experience sudden very high spirits, possibly even a feeling of
  lightness, you are feeling great elation.

  Elation is more than mere happiness — it is extreme, exhilarating joy.
  It has a sense of rising or expanding, even to the point of
  light-headedness. To help remember it, think of the (unrelated) word
  inflation, which has a similar sound. When you inflate a tire, you
  pump it up. When you are filled with elation, you are also, in a
  sense, "pumped up."

  Alas, his elation was short lived.

  interjection
   1. Увы! (Alas!, Alack!)

  DEFINITION

  exclamation
   1. an expression of grief, pity, or concern.
      "alas, my funds have some limitations"


  Alas is another way to emphatically say “unfortunately.” Perhaps you
  meant to finish up all your homework last night, but alas, your
  favorite television show wound up getting your undivided attention
  instead.

  Letting out a breathy alas in the middle of your sentence may sound
  dramatic or old fashioned, but it's actually an excellent way to
  emphasize extreme bewilderment, regret, concern, or woe. Once an
  expression of weariness rather than grief, alas stems from the Latin
  lassus, meaning “tired, weary.” Exclaimed Lord Byron, the English
  poet, “Alas! The love of women! It is known to be a lovely and fearful
  thing!”

  Alas, his elation was
  short lived.

   9. давать указание (admonish)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. warn or reprimand someone firmly.
      "she admonished me for appearing at breakfast unshaven"


  To admonish is to scold. If you want to show someone you're not happy
  with his behavior, admonish him. It sounds better than "scolding," and
  it's less painful than spanking.

  Coming to English through Old French from the Latin admonere "to
  advise, remind," admonish is always used with an eye on improving
  someone's behavior. The exact meaning of this formal verb varies in
  intensity depending generally on who is being corrected. If a child or
  subordinate is being admonished, it means "scold" or "rebuke" whereas
  if someone admonishes a person with equal standing, warn or advise are
  closer synonyms.

  (As Holmes admonishes Lestrade and Gregson when the two detectives
  fail to note a similarity between the murder being investigated and
  an earlier case, “There is nothing new under the sun.

  noun
   1. усердие (zeal, diligence, fervor, industry, assiduity, painstaking)
   2. старание (diligence, effort, endeavor, application, exertion, painstaking)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. done with or employing great care and thoroughness.
      "painstaking attention to detail"


  If you notice that painstaking is composed of pains and taking, you
  already have a pretty clear sense of what this adjective means: to be
  painstaking is to be so careful—so meticulous, so thorough that it
  hurts.

  Painstaking is most commonly paired with detail — in fact, writers
  might like to avoid the phrase “painstaking detail” as clichéd. In
  contemporary usage, the agony implied by the word often seems to be
  shared by both the person who makes a painstaking effort and the
  person confronted with the fruits of that labor: “Gertrude’s ability
  to appear politely interested was tested as her dinner companion
  related his painstaking attempts to establish himself as the true heir
  to the British throne.”

  To follow Sherlock Holmes is to learn to apply that same approach
  not just to external clues, but to your every thought—and then turn
  it around and apply it to the every thought of every other person
  who may be involved, step by painstaking step.

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. childishly silly and trivial.
      "you're making puerile excuses"


  Some people like their movies to have sophisticated humor and others
  prefer the more puerile humor of pratfalls or jokes about smelly
  underwear, inappropriate belching, and passing gas.

  Although the adjective, puerile can be used to describe anything
  related to childhood, more often than not, it is used in a derisive
  manner to comment on the immaturity, silliness, or juvenile nature of
  something or someone. So if you hear someone talk about puerile toys,
  they may merely be remarking on the toys of childhood, but it is more
  likely they are discussing whoopee cushions, fake dog poo, and the
  like.

  Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of
  observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for.”

  An inference is an idea or conclusion that's drawn from evidence and
  reasoning. An inference is an educated guess.

  We learn about some things by experiencing them first-hand, but we
  gain other knowledge by inference — the process of inferring things
  based on what is already known. When you make an inference, you're
  reading between the lines or just looking carefully at the facts and
  coming to conclusions. You can also make faulty inferences. If you
  hear a person's weight is 250 pounds, you might make the inference
  that they're overweight. But what if they're seven feet tall?

  Are you looking for another word to describe a person who is highly

  adept!

  In the days of Medieval Latin, an adeptus was a person who had learned
  the secrets of alchemy. Although an adept person today cannot turn
  lead into gold, the adjective is still high praise meaning "skilled,
  expert, highly proficient."

  Our brains are remarkably adept at learning new ways of thinking—and

  To pervade means to be present throughout, to exist in every part of.
  If you have too many cats, the horrible smell of cat pee will pervade
  your house.

  You can use pervade both for external things like smells and sickness,
  and for more internal things like feelings. For instance, you can say
  that a feeling of doom pervaded the army as they caught sight of the
  opposition’s superior forces. Despite efforts to prevent bullying,
  peer pressure and clique mentalities pervade the school environment.

  DEFINITION

  verb

      "she was conceived when her father was 49"
   2. form or devise (a plan or idea) in the mind.
      "the dam project was originally conceived in 1977"


  To conceive is to come up with an idea. If you conceive a plan for
  your little brother's birthday, you dream up the perfect party,
  complete with a magician, rented ponies, and a cake shaped like a
  rocket.

  Latin roots for conceive (by way of French) point to "take into"
  either "the womb" or "the mind." An idea is sometimes called "a seed"
  or "the seed of an idea," and conceive means to produce something from
  inside the mind — or to become pregnant. Another expression is
  "pregnant with ideas" or "pregnant with possibilities," and someone
  who can "conceive of a thousand ways" to solve a problem or design
  something is full of new ideas.

  Benedict de Spinoza was the first to conceive of this necessity of
  acceptance for comprehension, and, writing a hundred years before
  Gilbert, William James explained the principle as “All propositions,
  whether attributive or existential, are believed through the very
  fact of being conceived.”

  Hazy usually describes a sky that's fogged over or otherwise unclear.
  But if you're feeling a little uncertain or unsure about something,

  Choose the verb mitigate when something lessens the unpleasantness of
  a situation. You can mitigate your parents' anger by telling them you
  were late to dinner because you were helping your elderly neighbor.

  The somewhat formal verb mitigate comes from the Latin roots mītis
  "soft" and agere "to do/act," which add up to "to soften." It is often
  used with words that indicate an outcome or something harmful. When
  you buy car insurance, you are trying to mitigate the risks involved
  with driving. Sunscreen is used to mitigate the effects of the sun on
  your skin.

  You might describe a society's advancement as a result of new
  industries and an improved economy. You could also cheer your best

  snow will have an impact on driving conditions).

  Impact is used most often as a noun. A good teacher might have an

   3. an overhead compartment.

  Anything that's located above you is overhead — it’s literally over
  your head. An overhead compartment on an airplane is a good place to
  stash your carry-on suitcase. Overhead is also the money it takes to
  run a business.

  Overhead works as both an adjective and an adverb: "An overhead view
  of the football field gives the spectators a better idea of the game,
  and a drone flying overhead is the perfect way to achieve it." There's
  also an overhead stroke in tennis, an overhead projector showing a
  movie in science class, and the overhead, or up-front expenses, that a
  new business requires.

  Embracing multiple technologies doesn’t come without an overhead, of
  course.

   1. the art or technique of setting, writing, or playing a melody or melodies in conjunction with another, according to fixed rules.
      "Valen's approach was derived from Bach, from whose music he evolved a polyphonic technique of dissonant counterpoint ."
   2. an argument, idea, or theme used to create a contrast with the main element.
      "I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgment"

  verb
   1. add counterpoint to (a melody).
      "the orchestra counterpoints the vocal part"
   2. emphasize by contrast.
      "the cream walls and maple floors are counterpointed by black accents"


  To counterpoint is to contrast. If you point out that you should have
  class outside, someone might counterpoint by reminding you that it’s
  raining. In music, counterpoint is when two separate melodies are
  played or sung at the same time.

  When a composer writes a piece of music using voices that follow
  different rhythms or pitches but ultimately come together
  harmonically, she uses counterpoint. You can also use this word as a
  verb to mean "to highlight difference:" "My tidy bookshelves
  counterpoint the mess of papers and books on my desk." The musical
  meaning of counterpoint, "pricking musical notes under the original
  melody on a manuscript," comes from an earlier sewing or quilting
  meaning.

  Another counterpoint to
  concerns about mixing in different technologies is the size.

 undue
*** --->
  несвоевременный

  adjective
   1. несвоевременный (untimely, inopportune, undue, unseasonable, timeless, injudicious)
   2. чрезмерный (excessive, over, undue, superfluous, exceeding, extreme)
   3. неподходящий (unsuitable, inappropriate, improper, inopportune, inept, undue)
   4. по сроку не подлежащий оплате (undue)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. unwarranted or inappropriate because excessive or disproportionate.
      "this figure did not give rise to undue concern"


  When something isn't appropriate or justified, you can describe it as
  undue. For example, an undue delay in a hospital waiting room can be
  dangerous for someone with a bad injury.

  Something that's undue isn't warranted or, often, fair. The phrase
  "undue delay" is a common one, and it means that someone has to wait
  way too long for something, whether it's a building permit or a
  dentist appointment. The adjective has come to mean "excessive," from
  its original definition in the fourteenth century as literally "not
  owing" or "not payable."

  We’ll
  discuss how to make technology choices in Chapter 2, which focuses on
  evolutionary architecture; and in Chapter 4, which deals with
  integration, you’ll learn how to ensure that your services can evolve
  their technology independently of each other without undue coupling.

   4. надстройка (superstructure, bulkhead)
   5. навес (canopy, shed, overhang, awning, sunshade, bulkhead)
   6. крыша над пристройкой (bulkhead)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a dividing wall or barrier between compartments in a ship, aircraft, or other vehicle.
      "The frigates have a double-skinned hull divided by ten bulkheads into watertight compartments."


  The divider or wall between sections of a plane or large ship is
  called a bulkhead. When you're seated in first class on a jet, there's
  a bulkhead between you and the pilot's cabin.

  The bulkhead you're most likely to see is in a commercial airliner,
  dividing the flight crew from the passengers and sometimes the first
  class flyers from those in coach. Other vehicles have them too,
  including submarines and ships — these bulkheads help strengthen the
  vessels and keep different areas watertight. The Old Norse root of
  bulkhead is bálkr, "partition."

  A key concept in resilience engineering is the bulkhead.

  noun
   1. поручение (commission, errand, mission, message, charge, procuratory)
   2. командировка (business trip, mission, assignment, detached duty, official journey, errand)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a short journey undertaken in order to deliver or collect something, often on someone else's behalf.
      "she asked Tim to run an errand for her"


  An errand is a short trip to fulfill some small business. When you’re
  running errands, you’re making a bunch of these all at once.

  The noun errand can refer to the mission of the trip itself. If the
  lines are always long at the bank, then banking may be your least
  favorite errand. If you are off on a wild goose chase, you may be out
  on a fool's errand. If you are taking food or clothing to someone in
  need, then you are on an errand of mercy.

  All day long, you
  remember your errand.

  noun
   1. господство (domination, rule, dominance, dominating, supremacy, ascendancy)
   2. власть (power, authority, rule, control, grip, ascendancy)
   3. доминирующее влияние (ascendancy, ascendency, ascendance, ascendence)
   4. могущественное влияние (ascendancy, ascendance, ascendence, ascendency)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. occupation of a position of dominant power or influence.
      "the ascendancy of good over evil"


  When you assume ascendancy over someone else, you become more powerful
  than they are. Ascendancy is the state of being in a higher position.

  If you look at ascendancy, you see the word, ascend, which means to go
  up. Ascendancy is not so much about going up, but about being up.
  Another word for it is dominance, especially in the context of foreign
  or domestic relations. In school, if you question a teacher's
  ascendancy, you might be told to go to the principal's office. In this
  case, you're challenging the teacher's authority.

  And that automatic forgetfulness, that ascendancy of
  routine and the ease with which a thought can be distracted, is just the
  smallest part—albeit a particularly noticeable one, because we have the
  luxury of realizing that we’ve forgotten to do something—of a much
  larger phenomenon.

   7. встревожить (alarm, discompose, jolt)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. an abrupt rough or violent movement.
      "Any movement shot jolts of electricity to my toes, curling them in pain."

  verb
   1. push or shake (someone or something) abruptly and roughly.
      "a surge in the crowd behind him jolted him forward"


  To jolt someone is to disturb them or make them jump. A jolt is sudden
  and jarring.

  Jolting disturbs or surprises people. If you surprise someone and they
  jump up a little, you jolted them. Alarm clocks jolt people out of
  sleep. A sudden crack of thunder could provide a jolt. The unexpected
  barking of a dog could jolt you. Jolting is quick and not very
  pleasant. A jolt jars and stuns you. Some jolts are more serious:
  crashing your car jolts the people in the car violently.

  Only when something really
  catches our attention or forces us to stop or otherwise jolts us do we
  begin to know, turning on the more thoughtful, reflective, cool sibling.

      "he tripped over his cat"
   2. walk, run, or dance with quick light steps.
      "they tripped up the terrace steps"
   3. activate (a mechanism), especially by contact with a switch, catch, or other electrical device.

      "they prance around tripping out on their hallucinogens"
   6. go on a short journey.
      "when tripping through the Yukon, take some time to explore our museums"


  When you trip, you stumble or lose your footing. As a noun, a trip is
  a journey or outing, like your trip to the library yesterday or your
  trip to Japan last summer.

  You can trip over a bump in the sidewalk, and you can also trip
  another person, or make them stumble (although it's not very nice to
  do so on purpose). The 14th-century meaning of the verb was "tread
  lightly and nimbly, dance, or caper." Experts aren't quite sure how
  trip got from that to "awkwardly stumble."

  It’s awfully easy to
  get tripped up.

  доверчивость

  noun
   1. доверчивость (credulity, trustfulness, gullibility, credulousness)
   2. легковерие (credulity, easiness)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a tendency to be too ready to believe that something is real or true.
      "At one extreme, it is used to represent the unswerving conviction and absolute credulity of the true believer."


  Did you know that if you say credulity ten times fast it starts to
  sound like orange? If you believe that, then you have a lot of
  credulity. Credulity means gullibility, or a willingness to believe
  anything.

  Credulity is a tendency to believe in things too easily and without
  evidence. If a swindler is trying to sell you fake medicine, then he
  is "preying on your credulity." This noun is associated with being
  naïve, gullible or innocent. It shouldn’t be confused with
  credibility, which means “believability,” although it is often misused
  in this way. You might hear someone say, “the farfetched plot of that
  movie strained credulity,” but what he or she really means is
  “believability,” or “credibility.”

  In other words, begin with
  a healthy dose of skepticism instead of the credulity that is your
  mind’s natural state of being.

  noun
   1. a reflex act of opening one's mouth wide and inhaling deeply due to tiredness or boredom.
      "Hugh Bradley was in the pool recently and said the two boys had yawns as wide as a hippopotamus' mouth."

  verb
   1. involuntarily open one's mouth wide and inhale deeply due to tiredness or boredom.
      "he began yawning and looking at his watch"


  The reflex that makes you open your mouth wide, inhale, and then
  exhale is called a yawn. Even seeing photos of other people's yawns
  (or reading the word yawn) can make you yawn.

  We yawn when we're very bored or tired, or when our bodies need an
  influx of oxygen. Scientists aren't completely in agreement about all
  the reasons why we yawn, but the "contagious yawn" happens across all
  human societies and even in non-human animals like chimpanzees and
  dogs. Things can also yawn in a figurative way, when they're open
  wide. Yawn comes from gionian in Old English, "open the mouth wide."

  It’s a difficult proposition, especially to
  take on all at once—after all, it’s the same thing as asking your brain
  to go from its natural resting state to a mode of constant physical
  activity, expending important energy even where it would normally yawn,
  say okay, and move on to the next thing—but not an impossible one,
  especially if you’ve got Sherlock Holmes on your side.

   4. два очка (deuce)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a thing representing, or represented by, the number two, in particular.
   2. the tie score of 40-all in a game, at which a player needs two consecutive points to win the game.
      "Federer was in the sort of form which took him to the Wimbledon title this year, with Blake staving off an amazing 19 out of 20 break-point opportunities, and surviving 10 deuces in one service game."
   3. used as a euphemism for “devil” in expressions of annoyance, impatience, or surprise or for emphasis.
      "how the deuce are we to make a profit?"


  A deuce is one of the number two cards in a deck of cards. Or, in
  tennis, a deuce is a tie that must be broken by someone scoring two
  points in a row. When playing games, remember that when you hear
  deuce, it comes down to two.

  There are two main meanings of deuce, both of which relate to the
  number two. The first is a playing card: the two of clubs, diamonds,
  hearts, or spades is called a deuce. In sports like tennis and ping
  pong, a deuce is a tie. One player must score two consecutive points
  to break the deuce and win. This can go on for a while if the players
  are well-matched. A hard-fought point could feature one deuce after
  another.

  “How the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”

   1. a feeling of irritation or resentment resulting from a slight, especially to one's pride.

  verb
   1. stimulate (interest or curiosity).
      "you have piqued my curiosity about the man"
   2. feel irritated or resentful.
      "she was piqued by his curtness"
   3. pride oneself.
      "He piqued himself on being so with them more than with any one else."

  noun
   1. stiff fabric, typically cotton, woven in a strongly ribbed or raised pattern.


  The verb pique means to make someone angry or annoyed. But when
  something piques your interest or curiosity, here the verb pique just
  means to arouse, stimulate, or excite.

  Both the noun and verb are pronounced "pēk" and were borrowed from a
  French word meaning "a prick, irritation," from Old French, from
  piquer "to prick." So you can see how something that pricks you could
  make you both excited and angry. But it's frustrating––enough to make
  you want to storm away from learning vocab. That storming away, by the
  by, might be called a "fit of pique."

  That answer only piques Watson’s curiosity further.

  verb
   1. (of a person) suffer from a continuous dull pain.

   2. feel intense sadness or compassion.
      "she sat still and silent, her heart aching"
   3. feel an intense desire for.
      "she ached for his touch"


  An ache is a dull, lingering pain. An ache in your calves after your
  morning jog might mean you didn't stretch enough before you started
  running.

  You might describe your discomfort as a head ache or a stomach ache —
  in either case, there's a throbbing or continuous pain. A non-physical
  hurt can also be called an ache, and you can use the word as a verb in
  either case: "It feels like my heart will ache forever, since my sweet
  cat died." The Old English root is acan, "to suffer pain," possibly
  from an imitative Proto-Indo-European word that sounds like a groan.

  And just like a muscle that you never knew you had—one that suddenly
  begins to ache, then develop and bulk up as you begin to use it more and

  verb
   1. put in the wrong place and lose temporarily because of this; mislay.
      "I'm sure the jewelry has just been misplaced, and not stolen"


  When you misplace your car keys, you can't remember where you put
  them. In other words, you temporarily lose them.

  You can use the verb misplace when you can't find something. If you
  misplace your favorite coffee cup, you'll be annoyed, but if you
  misplace your wallet it could cause you real problems. The word
  implies that the object isn't gone for good, but that you unthinkingly
  put it down somewhere. When you combine the prefix mis-, which means
  "bad or wrong," and place, you get misplace — as in placing something
  in a bad spot!

  When we do such decidedly unremarkable things as misplacing our keys or
  losing our glasses only to find them on our head, System Watson is to

      "the moon exerts a force on the Earth"
   2. make a physical or mental effort.

  Exert basically means to put forth effort to do something. For
  example, when you exert yourself in a workout, you can really feel the
  burn in your muscles.

  The Latin verb exserere — with its derivative form exsertus, which is
  the source of our word — means to "put forth." That's where exert gets
  its meaning of physical force — consider that when you try hard at
  something, you put forth effort to do it, you push yourself. But exert
  can refer to other ways you "push": you exert your influence to
  convince others to think your way; when one nation exerts its power on
  another; and gravity exerts its force on us, holding us down on earth.

  But in order to break from that autopiloted mode, we have to be
  motivated to think in a mindful, present fashion, to exert effort on
  what goes through our heads instead of going with the flow.

   1. a conventional way of describing someone who has died or something that has been lost or that has ceased to exist.
      "the late and much lamented Leonard Bernstein"

  verb
   1. mourn (a person's loss or death).
      "he was lamenting the death of his infant daughter"


  Use the adjective lamented to talk fondly about someone who's died.
  You might describe your favorite elementary school teacher as "my dear
  lamented Mrs. McGinty."

  Lamented is often used in the phrase "late lamented," which implies
  that the person you're talking about is dead and that you really miss
  him or her. Inanimate objects can also be lamented, like the
  neighborhood book shop that closed, or a magazine you used to read
  that is no longer in print. The root Latin word is lamentationem,
  which describes wailing, moaning, and weeping.

  In fact, motivation is so essential that researchers have often
  lamented the difficulty of getting accurate performance comparisons
  on cognitive tasks for older and younger participants.

  adjective
   1. начинающий (beginning, starting, novice, catechumen, entering, inceptive)
   2. новообращенный (convert, proselyte, catechumen, novice, converted, neophyte)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a person new to or inexperienced in a field or situation.
      "he was a complete novice in foreign affairs"


  If you're a novice at snowboarding, you're just learning the sport. On
  the Internet, a novice might be called a newbie, but your parents
  would call one a beginner.

  Novice is derived from the Latin word novus, which means new. A novice
  is new to what they do, so a novice photographer is just learning how
  to take nice pictures. Other words related to novice are novel "new,
  unusual," and innovate "to invent, begin with new ideas." Novice can
  also mean a member of a Christian order who has not yet taken their
  vows.

  Anders Ericsson
  argues that experts even see the world differently within their area of
  expertise: they see things that are invisible to a novice; they are able
  to discern patterns at a glance that are anything but obvious to an
  untrained eye; they see details as part of a whole and know at once what
  is crucial and what is incidental.

   2. несовместимость (incompatibility, inconsistency, incongruity, repugnance, antipathy)
   3. неуместность (irrelevance, impropriety, incongruity, ineptitude, impertinence, inaptitude)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the state of being incongruous or out of keeping.
      "the incongruity of his fleshy face and skinny body disturbed her"


  Incongruity means out of place — something that doesn't fit in its
  location or situation. The art show patrons couldn't help but chuckle
  at the incongruity of a toilet sitting in the middle of an exhibition
  of Renaissance paintings.

  An incongruity is very different from everything around it, to the
  point of being inappropriate to the situation. A cat at a dog's
  birthday party would be an incongruity, as would a pacifist at a
  meeting of the War Lovers' Society. Incongruity is the idea that
  something is incongruous, or inappropriate. A purple towel is an
  incongruity in an all black-and-white bathroom.

  It’s fun to home in on that incongruity between the superhuman-seeming
  detective and a failure to grasp a fact so rudimentary that even a child
  would know it.

   4. недоразвитый (underdeveloped, aborted, rudimentary, abortive, neuter, dwarfish)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. involving or limited to basic principles.
      "he received a rudimentary education"


  Rudimentary means basic, or at a very early stage. The test should be
  easy: it requires only a rudimentary understanding of the materials.

  The word rude means simple or offensive––people with only rudimentary
  understanding of good manners might not know how that belching is
  rude. Remember that the word rude is the foundation of rudimentary
  you'll have a rudimentary understanding of the word.

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the amount of something that is permitted, especially within a set of regulations or for a specified purpose.
      "a seventy-five-pound baggage allowance"

  verb
   1. give (someone) a sum of money regularly as an allowance.
      "She spoke of getting travel allowanced but this depended on the social worker who had been assigned and they are not allowed leave their accommodation for more than three days."


  When you're a kid, you might earn an allowance or a sum of money in
  exchange for doing chores around the house. Your parents' allowance —
  or tolerance — of your silly behavior will depend on how strict they
  are.

  An allowance is a quantity of something that's allowed or permitted
  within a set of rules or for a particular purpose. This could be a
  weekly allowance you earn as a kid, or it could be the allowance for
  passengers on a flight to have two carry-on items. To make allowances
  for someone means to treat someone leniently, or to give them a break.

  astronomy in future stories—in “The Musgrave Ritual,” he talks about
  “allowances for personal equation, as the astronomers would have it”; in
  “The Greek Interpreter,” about the “obliquity of the ecliptic”; in “The
  Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans,” about “a planet leaving its
  orbit.”

  Obliquity is a characteristic of being deliberately indirect or vague,
  especially to fool or deceive someone. The obliquity of many
  politicians makes it hard to get a straight answer from them.

  If your teacher comments on the obliquity of your poem, it may be a
  compliment, or it may mean your writing is just hard to understand.
  And while obliquity isn't a bad quality in a poet, it's less desirable
  in a math tutor, or anyone who needs to be straightforward and clear.
  We can trace the origin of obliquity back to the Latin obliquus,
  "slanting, sidelong, or indirect."

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. represent (something) as being larger, greater, better, or worse than it really is.
      "they were apt to exaggerate any aches and pains"


  When you exaggerate you stretch the truth. Fishermen tend to
  exaggerate the size of their fish. And children tend to exaggerate the
  seriousness of their cuts in order to get cute Band-Aids.

  We all have a tendency to exaggerate. It makes our stories funnier, or
  more dramatic. After all, when you exaggerate, you're not really lying
  — you're just overstating things. The word exaggerate can also suggest
  that a particular characteristic is overdone or almost larger than
  life. If you describe someone as having an exaggerated limp, he or she
  might be walking like a gorilla.

  In fact, I would argue that he exaggerates his ignorance precisely to
  draw our attention to a second—and, I think, much more important—point.

   3. неравномерный (uneven, irregular, lopsided)
   4. наклоненный (slanted, bent, lopsided, pitched)
   5. накрененный (lopsided)
   6. однонаправленный (lopsided)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. with one side lower or smaller than the other.
      "a lopsided grin"


  Something that's lopsided is crooked or off-balance, like your
  grandma's lopsided hat, which sits askew on her head.

  You can use the adjective lopsided to describe things that are crooked
  or asymmetrical. A bad toothache might cause one side of your jaw to
  swell, leaving your face feeling — and looking — lopsided. Your might
  say that your school's student council election is lopsided if one
  candidate is clearly more qualified than the other. The word lopsided
  was originally lapsided, and in the early 1700s it almost always
  referred to a tilting ship.

  When I first heard the term brain attic—back in the days of firelight
  and the old crimson hardcover—all I could picture in my seven-year-old

  chimney, and window with open shutters.

   5. вспучиваться (distend)
   6. вспучивать (distend, swell up)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. swell or cause to swell by pressure from inside.
      "the abdomen distended rapidly"


  A soda and pizza binge might make your stomach distend, meaning your
  stomach will swell as a result of pressure from the inside.

  If you’ve ever eaten too much food it won’t surprise you to learn that
  the verb distend traces back to the Latin words dis-, meaning “apart,”
  and tendere, meaning “to stretch.” Your stomach will certainly feel
  stretched out if you do something — like overeat — that causes it to
  distend. The word distend often applies to stomachs — a pregnancy
  would also cause a stomach to distend — but it can also refer to
  anything that is stretched out as a result of internal pressure.

   4. несравнимый (incomparable, disparate, unapproachable)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. essentially different in kind; not allowing comparison.
      "they inhabit disparate worlds of thought"

  noun
   1. things so unlike that there is no basis for comparison.
      "The second class of disparates have more to do with the particular foibles of the aperture involved."


  The trunk of some people's cars may contain items as disparate as old
  clothes, rotting food, and possibly a missing relative. Disparate
  things are very different from each other.

  Near synonyms are unequal and dissimilar. The adjective disparate is
  from Latin disparātus, from disparāre "to separate, divide," from the
  prefix dis- "apart" plus parāre "to prepare." Disparate in the sense
  of "very different" probably developed by association with the Latin
  adjective dispar "unequal, different."

  But whatever it looks like, it
  is a space in your head, specially fashioned for storing the most
  disparate of objects.

   8. способность запоминания (retention)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the continued possession, use, or control of something.
      "the retention of direct control by central government"


  You can use retention to mean the ability to keep or hold. If you have
  extraordinary powers of retention, you remember everything you hear or
  learn.

  Are your ankles ever swollen after a long flight? This comes from the
  lack of movement which can cause the retention of water. The roots of
  the word, Latin re- "back" and tenere "to hold," say it all. You often
  use the word in the military or business contexts to talk about
  keeping soldiers, or employees, from leaving. If you're lucky, they
  might offer you a retention bonus to prevent you from quitting.

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. (of a person) open and responsive to suggestion; easily persuaded or controlled.
      "parents who have had easy babies and amenable children"


  If your friends want to try sky diving and you're amenable to the
  idea, sounds like you're going to be jumping out of a plane. If a
  person or thing is amenable to something, they are ready, willing, or
  responsive.

  Note that amenable is often followed by the preposition to, which
  makes amenable mean "able to be controlled or affected by something,"
  as in "They are usually amenable to our wishes;" or "Her heart
  condition is not amenable to treatment." An amenable personality is
  open to influence or control and is willing to agree or yield.

  adjective
   1. договорный (treaty, contractual, contract, negotiable, contracted, agreed)
   2. подрядный (contracting, contract)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a written or spoken agreement, especially one concerning employment, sales, or tenancy, that is intended to be enforceable by law.
      "both parties must sign employment contracts"

  verb
   1. decrease in size, number, or range.
      "glass contracts as it cools"
   2. enter into a formal and legally binding agreement.
      "the local authority will contract with a wide range of agencies to provide services"
   3. catch or develop (a disease or infectious agent).
      "three people contracted a killer virus"
   4. become liable to pay (a debt).
      "he contracted a debt of $3,300"


  When you and someone else have agreed on something and that agreement
  is both binding and enforceable by law, you have a contract. When you
  rent an apartment, you and your future landlord sign a rental
  contract.

  You can also use the word in this sense as a verb meaning "to hire."
  Wouldn't you like to contract someone to clean your room for you? In
  other verbal uses of contract, place the accent on the second syllable
  — kun-TRAKT. If you contract a disease, you catch it, but only use
  this if it's something serious. You catch a cold, but contract
  malaria. Contract also means "shrink." When the economy contracts,
  consumers stop buying things, and people lose their jobs, and if you
  freeze water, it contracts too.

  It can
  expand, albeit not indefinitely, or it can contract, depending on how we
  use it (in other words, our memory and processing can become more or
  less effective).

   1. a sum of money placed or kept in a bank account, usually to gain interest.
      "Any money market accounts, certificates of deposits , bank bonds, Treasuries, and savings are assets."
   2. a sum payable as a first installment on the purchase of something or as a pledge for a contract, the balance being payable later.

  You are making a deposit when you put money into your bank account. In
  that sentence, deposit is a noun, but you could express the same
  action using deposit as a verb. You deposit money into your bank
  account.

  The verb deposit can be used to refer to anything that you put down or
  in place. If you're carrying your keys and groceries from the car, you
  may deposit those items on the counter. Just be careful you don't end
  up playing "where are my keys" in the morning, if the counter is not
  your usual place for depositing them. You can also use deposit when
  nature does the placing. You find a deposit of gold in the mountain
  rock or there is sediment deposited at the bottom of a river.

   1. границы (scope, confines, ambit, purview, purlieus)
   2. ограничения (confines)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. keep or restrict someone or something within certain limits of (space, scope, quantity, or time).
      "he does not confine his message to politics"

  noun
   1. the borders or boundaries of a place, especially with regard to their restricting freedom of movement.
      "they were cramped within the confines of a little cabin"


  If you spend a lot of time in the same four block radius, you could
  say those streets make up your confines. Confines means an area with a
  clear boundary.

  Think of confines as a confined or restricted space. The fact that
  there is a boundary is the important part of this word. You might say
  that things said in the confines of your office should not be shared,
  or suggest that your parents get out of the confines of their
  residential development a little more often. It is always used in the
  plural in this sense.

  At the end, it will have to remain
  within certain confines—each attic, once again, is different and subject
  to its unique constraints—but within those confines, it can take on any
  number of configurations, depending on how we learn to approach it.

 unduly
*** --->
  чрезмерно

  adverb
   1. чрезмерно (excessively, overly, overmuch, over, unduly, prohibitive)
   2. незаконно (unduly, illegitimately)
   3. неправильно (wrong, improperly, amiss, unduly, awry, fallaciously)


  If something is done unduly, it's done out of proportion with what's
  reasonable or right. If you're unduly treated, you're not treated in
  the way you deserve to be.

  Duly comes from the late 14th century duweliche meaning "rightly,
  properly." The prefix un-, meaning "not" of course reverses that
  meaning so with unduly we get "not rightly or properly." You might
  become unduly angry with a toddler for tracking mud into the house.
  Unduly can also mean "excessively." Worrying unduly about the future
  can be paralyzing. Sometimes it's good to take the days as they come.

  We can, however, learn to master many aspects of our attic’s structure,
  throwing out junk that got in by mistake (as Holmes promises to forget
  Copernicus at the earliest opportunity), prioritizing those things we
  want to and pushing back those that we don’t, learning how to take the
  contours of our unique attic into account so that they don’t unduly
  influence us as they otherwise might.

   2. пена (foam, froth, scum, lather, head, spume)
   3. мыло (soap, foam, lather)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a frothy white mass of bubbles produced by soap or a similar cleansing substance when mixed with water.
      "Almost 60 per cent of water was wasted in washing of excess lather from the clothes."

  verb
   1. (with reference to soap or a similar cleansing substance) form or cause to form a frothy white mass of bubbles.
      "soap will not lather in hard water"
   2. rub soap onto (a part of the body) until a lather is produced.
      "she was lathering herself languidly beneath the shower"
   3. cause (a horse) to become covered with sweat.
      "his horse was lathered up by the end of the day"
   4. cover something liberally with (a substance).
      "she lathered a slice of toast with butter"
   5. thrash (someone).


  A lather is the froth soaps and detergents produce. Lathering also
  means to soap yourself up, and a lather can be a state of extreme
  agitation.

  When you're taking a shower, you make the soap frothy: this is a
  lather, and you're lathering when you create it. Rubbing soap on your
  body is also called lathering. Since lather is a stirred-up form of
  soap, it can also apply to emotions that have been stirred up. Someone
  upset is in a lather. Getting in a lather usually results from worry
  or anger, and it's an unpleasant state of mind.

  After eating too many gingerbread cookies, she no longer fit into her
  uniform, so she had a seamstress alter it. It looked pretty much the
  same.

  The verb alter can also mean to neuter or spay. Think of a cat that
  has just been spayed: the cat you pick up from the vet is the same cat
  that you dropped off there, only perhaps a little groggy and unable to
  reproduce. While the cat has been altered, it's not a different cat.

  No one knows alterations like tailors. All they do is adjust, modify

  noun
   1. a person employed to provide a service to the public in a particular place.
      "a flight attendant"
   2. a person who is present at an event, meeting, or function.
      "he had become a regular attendant at chapel"


  An attendant is someone present at a meeting or event. A flight
  attendant, for example, tends to the needs of passengers on a plane
  trip.

  The word attendant has to do with being present. An attendant on a
  flight is present to help you if you need anything. An attendant event
  is one that happens in the presence of another event. In other words,
  it can mean "accompanying." An illness can have attendant symptoms
  that go along with it. Remember that the word ends in -ant.

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. make someone aware of or familiar with.
      "new staff should be acquainted with fire exit routes"


  When you're acquainted with someone, it means you know each other. If
  you're taking the city bus and realize that you know several of your
  fellow riders, you could say, "I'm acquainted with half of the
  passengers on this bus."

  As long as you know something or someone fairly well, you are
  acquainted with it, so you can be acquainted with a city, a
  mathematical idea, or a particular poem. The trickiest thing about the
  word acquainted is the way it's spelled. Like the words acquit and
  acquire, you just have to keep in mind that a c needs to go before the
  qu. After you've spelled it several times, you'll be well acquainted
  with the correct spelling.

  A funny-looking adverb that appears to be made up of three words

  It’s likely that nevertheless evolved from the Middle English
  neverthelater, a word with the same sense of “despite anything to the
  contrary” and “notwithstanding.” You might say of your siblings, "Sure
  we bicker and get sick of each other sometimes. Nevertheless, they’re

  Someone who makes a lot of ado about things has a tendency to make
  them more busy or complicated than they need to be.

  A flurry of activity or a lot of complaining about a little problem
  are both examples of ado. It's an old fashioned word, dating back to
  the fourteenth century, when it meant "conflict or trouble." "At do"
  was a Norse version of the English phrase "to do," which was
  eventually shortened to ado. The most famous use of the word is
  probably the Shakespeare play "Much Ado About Nothing."

  A directive is an order or official notice that comes from an

  Directives often come from employers, governments, supervisors,
  judges, or other authority figures. A math teacher might issue a

  teachers to find ways to cut down on cheating during exams. Directive

  You ramble when your talking or your walking goes on and on and on.
  And on. You’re in no hurry to make a point or get to your destination
  — if there is one at all.

  The word ramble comes from similar roots as roam. They both mean
  wander, but they’re often used a little differently. You might roam
  around on vacation to relax or find adventure. If you’re a shark, you
  roam the deep sea for food. On the other hand, if the person on the

  on."

  Belabor is made up of the Latin roots be and labor meaning "to exert
  one's strength upon." You can belabor a point by using excessive
  detail, or you could belabor the obvious by stating over and over what

  The informal miffed is great for describing a feeling of irritation or
  impatience. Your teacher might be miffed if you keep showing up late

  excuse that the bus is always late. Miffed came along in the early

  A hellion is someone who makes mischief or gets into trouble. You

  regularly refuse to go to bed, instead staging massive pillow fights.

  Hellion almost always describes a young person, often a child, who
  raises a ruckus or makes trouble in some rowdy way. The little boy
  next door might have most people fooled into thinking he's an angel,
  but you'll know he's a hellion when you spot him jumping off the roof

  If your job pays a good wage, it means that you earn a lot of money
  for the hard work you do. If you're not happy with your wage, you
  might have to wage war on your boss.

  Wage is one of those words whose verb and noun forms have entirely
  different meanings. A worker's wage is how much money she makes. But
  when you wage something, you carry it out: for example, a warmonger is
  someone whose primary goal is to wage wars. The word is of Germanic
  origin, and it's related to both gage and wed, with their underlying
  meanings of "to pledge."

  Whether you’re a wage slave or a Fortune 500 CEO, this

  verb
   1. wander about as or like a vagabond.
      "At home most of the time, I would bundle my baby in his stroller and go vagabonding as and when the weather would allow."


  A vagabond is someone who moves around a lot. Picture Boxcar Willie,
  bandana on a stick thrown over his shoulder, going wherever the breeze
  takes him.

  Vagabond can also be an adjective, a nomadic tribe is a vagabond one,
  or the person who moved eight times in two years is living a vagabond
  life. It's from the Latin word vagabundus (from vagari, "wander")
  which means "inclined to wander." So — if you were born a ramblin'
  man, you might just be a vagabond.

   4. спортплощадка (sports ground, playground, athletic field, ground, field)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. an outdoor area provided for children to play on, especially at a school or public park.
      "The man's licence conditions were not to go to schools, public parks, playgrounds , swimming pools or leisure centres."


  A playground is a place to frolic and play. Most kids know where the
  nearest playground is because that’s where the swings and slides are.
  Neighborhoods and schools usually have a playground. Weeeeee!

  A playground built especially for kids has equipment for them to play
  on, like climbing structures, swings, seesaws, and play houses. Many
  public parks have this kind of playground. When adults talk about
  their favorite playgrounds, they usually mean a place they go to do
  the sports or activities they love. A nearby mountain, for example,
  could be described as a playground for snow boarders.

  It’s an experimental playground for those who
  want better results in less time.

      "the various alternative methods for resolving disputes"

  noun
   1. one of two or more available possibilities.
      "audiocassettes are an interesting alternative to reading"


  When you're facing a fork in the road, you have two possibilities, or
  alternatives. You could take the left fork and see where it leads, or
  you could choose the path that goes to the right.

  Whenever there is an alternative, it involves a choice. A wealthy
  student has the choice of going to a public school, or the
  alternative, a private school. Alternative can also refer to a
  different way of doing things, outside the norm. You might say that a
  hermit who lives in remote a cave with a pet turtle is living an
  alternative lifestyle.

  People are
  open to exploring alternatives (and more forgiving of others who do the
  same), as many of the other options—the once “safe” options—have failed.

      "they dabbled their feet in the rock pools"
   2. take part in an activity in a casual or superficial way.
      "he dabbled in writing as a young man"


  You dabble when you are a little bit involved in an activity, such as
  an art form or a hobby. Maybe you only dabble in mystery novels, but
  you are very knowledgeable about comic books.

  The word dabble can also often relate to water. It can mean “to splash
  playfully,” or “to get just a little wet.” A bird can also dabble in
  water by dipping its bill into it. Each of these meanings of dabble is
  often followed by the word in. For example, a duck may dabble in the
  water (and then dribble a few drops afterward from its bill), and you
  may dabble in shrubbery art.

  This period of collective panic is your big chance to dabble.

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. put off (an action or event) to a later time; postpone.
      "they deferred the decision until February"
   2. submit humbly to (a person or a person's wishes or qualities).
      "he deferred to Tim's superior knowledge"


  Defer means to put off or delay. You can try to defer the inevitable
  by pushing “snooze” and falling back asleep, but eventually you're
  going to have to get up.

  If you're excellent at pushing things to a later date and a master at
  procrastination, then you already know how to defer. But defer can
  also mean to comply with another person’s opinion or wishes. So when
  your boss finds out you deferred your work to shop online instead, you
  should probably defer when she asks you to come in and finish
  everything up over the weekend.

  This book is for anyone who is sick of the deferred-life
  plan and wants to live life large instead of postpone it.

   3. the lens in a telescope or microscope nearest to the object observed.

  An objective is something you plan to achieve. A military objective is
  the overall plan for a mission. The objective for a bake sale is to
  raise money. If your objective is to learn a new word, you have
  succeeded.

  An objective is the point of something. If you don’t understand the
  objective of a class, then you don’t know what you were supposed to
  learn. The word itself is often used in business or work. Another
  meaning of objective is “looking at things in a detached, impartial,
  fact-based way.” If a police officer falls in love with a witness, it
  might be hard for her to stay objective. The word comes from the Latin
  ob "against" + jacere "to throw.”

  The objective is to create freedom of time and
  place and use both however you want.

  Majority means “most of,” or the biggest part. Does the majority of
  what owls eat — mice, rats, squirrels, moles — sound appetizing to
  you? If not, you’re probably in the majority of people.

  In an election, victory usually goes to whoever wins the majority of

  Something that reflects comes back to you. If you look in a mirror,
  you will see your reflected image. If you reflect on your past
  experiences, you look at them once again thoughtfully.

  Reflect also means to give evidence of the character or quality of
  something. Most parents want their children to reflect their own
  strengths by emulating their behavior. A set of telling statistics
  could reflect the buying trends in an economic cycle. Reflecting can

      "the audience had begun to fidget on their chairs"


  To fidget is to make little movements with your hands and feet. Even
  if you're nervous during your job interview, try not to fidget.

  The word fidget is related to the Old Norse fikja, meaning "move
  briskly, be restless or eager." If you are feeling impatient or
  anxious you might fidget in your seat or fidget with a pen in your
  hands. A person who fidgets a lot can be referred to as a fidget and
  so can that quick anxious movement itself.

      "After the wedding ceremony, the bride is accompanied by her chaperone , even if staying overnight with the groom's family."

  verb
   1. accompany and look after or supervise.
      "Ripley places the blame on the 14 months she spent filming in France and England, chaperoned by her mother but away from home and her friends at school in Dundee."


  High school dances always have at least one chaperone to keep an eye
  on things. A chaperone is someone who looks after and supervises
  another person or a group of people.

  Chaperone can also be spelled chaperon, without the e. It originally
  meant a woman whose duty was to accompany a younger woman and make
  sure she wasn't harmed and didn't get into trouble, especially when
  she was with a man. These days, chaperone is most often used to
  describe an adult who supervises a group of kids or teenagers. The Old
  English meaning was "protective hood or head covering," and today the
  word chaperone retains that "protective" quality.

   1. (especially of a leaf) having a wavy surface or edge.

  verb
   1. move with a smooth wavelike motion.
      "her body undulated to the thumping rhythm of the music"


  Undulate means to move in a wave-like pattern. If a sound increases
  and decreases in pitch or volume like waves, you can say the sound is
  undulating. When searching for the lost boy, the rescuers' cries
  undulated through the forest.

  The verb undulate comes from the Latin word undula, which means
  "wavelet" (unda means "wave"). So any action shown with the verb
  undulate has that waving sense to it. If something moves in a wavy,
  pattern, for example, it is said to undulate. The wind might cause
  prairie grass to undulate, or music might cause hips to undulate.

  Fathom is from Middle English fadme, from Old English fæthm
  "outstretched arms." The Old English and modern English noun also
  refers to a unit of length used to measure the depth of water. To

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. hard, menial, or dull work.
      "domestic drudgery"


  If you’ve ever had to do the laundry, wash the dishes, make the meals,
  change the bedding, vacuum the house, and clean the bathrooms day
  after day, you’ve experienced drudgery. Drudgery is hard, mindless,
  backbreaking work.

  When you say the word drudgery, you can almost feel the hard, plodding
  work that it describes. You have to put some effort into saying the
  dr- sound. Then, as soon as you get through the breathy -u-, you’ve
  got two more hard sounds in -dg- and -er- before you get another break
  with the final vowel sound. Just as you might drag yourself doing
  those repetitive, grinding chores, you have to drag your way through
  pronouncing the word.

  Most people, my

  "sleight of hand." If you are a good magician, you can make a coin
  disappear with sleight of hand.

  The noun sleight refers to cunning or cleverness, especially when used
  to trick or deceitfully. You can use a sleight of mind to trick
  yourself into believing that if you eat a box of cookies at dinnertime
  it counts as dinner. The word sleight with its meaning as being sneaky

  "gh" even though today we don't.

  advantage of the present circumstances and enjoying life to the

 famine
*** --->
  голод

  noun
   1. голод (hunger, famine, starvation, dearth, famishment)
   2. голодание (starvation, hunger, famine, famishment)
   3. недостаток (lack, drawback, flaw, deficiency, shortage, famine)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. extreme scarcity of food.
      "drought could result in famine throughout the region"


  A famine is a severe shortage of food, but not the "I forgot to go to
  the grocery store and there's nothing to eat in the house" type of
  shortage. A famine is usually caused by crop failure or disaster.

  Although the "extreme shortage of food" meaning is most common, the
  noun famine can also mean any shortage or insufficiency, and it is
  often used idiomatically in the phrase "feast or famine." This usage
  refers to something that is alternately plentiful and scarce — like
  the feast and famine experienced by an artist who only occasionally
  sells his paintings.

  I’m going to
  assume you are suffering from time famine, creeping dread, or—worst
  case—a tolerable and comfortable existence doing something unfulfilling.

  освобождение

  noun
   1. освобождение (release, liberation, exemption, emancipation, relief, deliverance)
   2. выделение (discharge, excretion, liberation, secretion, allotment, assignment)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the act of setting someone free from imprisonment, slavery, or oppression; release.
      "the liberation of all political prisoners"


  Liberation means the setting free of someone or something. Wild
  animals raised in captivity are often unprepared for their liberation
  when they are released back into the wild.

  You'll notice right off the bat that liberation is related to the noun
  liberty — as in "liberty and justice for all." The difference is that
  liberation refers specifically to the act of being made free, of going
  from having no freedom to having it. Famous moments of liberation
  include Europe's liberation from the Nazis, the slaves' liberation
  from slavery in the U.S., and South Africa's liberation from the
  oppression of apartheid.

  Liberation is not about cheap
  travel; it is about forever breaking the bonds that confine you to a

  Flawless is an adjective that means "without any imperfections," like

  In flawless you can see the word flaw, which means "a fault." So
  something that is flawless is free of faults, perfect. If you've never

  noun
   1. a side part of something, especially a shoot or branch growing out from the side of a stem.
      "If the leader is growing vigorously and no laterals are forming at a height you would like, pinch out an inch of the tip growth when it is at the height you would like a permanent branch."
   2. a lateral consonant.
      "Obstruent laterals , which are mainly found in indigenous languages of North America, are sometimes thought of as liquids but do not have their high sonority."
   3. a pass thrown either sideways or backward from the position of the passer.
      "After taking a lateral from White, Butler scored and jumped head-first into the front row of the endzone seats."

  verb
   1. throw (a football) in a sideways or backward direction.
      "he tried to lateral a kick return but fumbled"


  When something is extending to the side or moving to the side, it’s
  lateral. "All of the lateral movement in tennis hurt her knees and she
  had to quit playing."

  The adjective lateral comes from the Latin word lateralis, which means
  “belonging to the side” and the modern meaning is basically the same.
  In anatomy, views of the body from the left, as well as from the right
  are referred to as lateral. You can make a lateral career move, if the
  compensation and level of responsibility stay about the same (instead
  of moving up, you are moving to the side). A lateral pass in football
  is one that goes to the side or behind the passer, instead of directly
  towards the goal.

   4. психиатрическая больница (mental hospital, asylum, mental house, mental home, lunatic asylum, retreat)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the protection granted by a nation to someone who has left their native country as a political refugee.
      "she applied for asylum and was granted refugee status"
   2. an institution offering shelter and support to people who are mentally ill.
      "he'd been committed to an asylum"


  When someone needs a refuge from a difficult or dangerous situation,
  they need asylum. If a government offers to protect people who have
  fled war or hardship in their own country, it gives them asylum.

  You may have heard asylum used to describe an institution where insane
  people are housed, but did you know that an asylum can also be
  somewhere you’d happily and willingly go? An asylum offers shelter and
  protection, like the awning of a building in a downpour. Or it could
  be a country that takes in refugees in danger of persecution —
  otherwise known as "political asylum."

  adjective
   1. denoting a person who professes but does not actively give support to a specified (especially radical) political view.
      "parlor libertarians"


  A parlor is a living room or a sitting room, the place in your house
  with comfortable chairs and sofas. You might also decide to put your
  giant new TV in the parlor.

  The noun parlor is an old-fashioned one. Still, almost anyone would
  know what you meant if you invited them to join you in the parlor for
  tea. These days, a hotel, inn, or historic house is more likely to
  have a parlor than a private home is. The thirteenth century version,
  parlur, meant "room in a monastery for holding conversations." The
  "conversations" part stems from parler, "to speak" in French.

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. (in bridge, whist, and similar card games) a playing card of the suit chosen to rank above the others, which can win a trick where a card of a different suit has been led.
      "The winner of the first trick must lead a trump to the second trick if he holds one."
   2. a trumpet or a trumpet blast.
      "The visual aspect also played its part at the start of the Third Reflection, when the three horns, representing the final trump , came in from the back and took their seats in the orchestra!"

  verb
   1. (in bridge, whist, and similar card games) play a trump on (a card of another suit), having no cards of the suit led.
      "The fourth to play after a non-trump card has been trumped by his partner, when unable to either follow suit or overtrump, must undertrump even if his partner holds the trick."


  To trump is to outrank or defeat someone or something, often in a
  highly public way. Safety might trump appearance when you're buying a
  car, or your desires may trump your brother's when it comes to making
  weekend plans.

  In the card game bridge, the trump card is the most powerful card in a
  particular round and defeats all the others — sort of like when your
  needs or wishes trump someone else's. Originally trump implied a
  deceptive form of victory involving cheating, but that sense has been
  largely lost, though it's still around in the term trumped up, meaning
  something that's been falsely made up. A politician may face trumped
  up charges that could ruin his career.

  This word should be used with a lot of caution. Calling someone who's

      "I could have freaked out and started smashing the place up"
   2. fleck or streak randomly.
      "the white pink and the pansy freaked with jet"


  Freak is a not-so-nice noun that refers to either a person who
  expresses such an intense obsession with something that it resembles
  addiction, or a person or animal that is monstrous and deformed.

  Synonyms for freak, when used to describe something or something
  abnormal, include anomaly, chimera, misshape, and oddity. Weirdo is
  slang for freak, and regular is its antonym. People who ardently adore
  a particular type of music, like heavy metal, or who have many
  piercings or identify with a subculture, are often labeled freak. A
  freak occurrence, on the other hand, is not necessarily a bad thing,
  but connotes something irregular or unexpected. A freak of nature can
  lead to thunder-snow, and a freak accident can lead to, well, a
  missing ear or toe.

  verb
   1. collapse or cause to collapse violently inward.
      "the windows on both sides of the room had imploded"
   2. utter or pronounce (a consonant) with a sharp intake of air.


  When something implodes, it explodes inward — instead of outward. With
  extremely large buildings, it helps to implode them rather than
  explode them, because by falling inward they take up less space.

  Why bother to have a word like implode when you already have explode?
  Well, imagine there is something deep beneath the sea, being subjected
  to the intense pressure there. If the pressure is high enough that the
  object bursts, it would collapse in rather than out. It would, in
  fact, implode. People also sometimes use implode to describe a person
  subjected to intense pressures who, emotionally at least, bursts
  inward: "All that stress just made Jess implode."

   6. обнищалый (impoverished)

  verb
   1. make (a person or area) poor.

  Impoverished describes being really, really poor, either from having
  no money or being in bad health. A person who lives on the street is
  impoverished, and a country may become impoverished after a
  devastating war.

  Impoverished comes from the Old French word povre, which means “poor,”
  and you can almost see the word poverty inside impoverished. Living an
  impoverished life means that your finances and health are not in good
  shape, and in fact you could die because you can’t support yourself. A
  corrupt and greedy government makes its citizens impoverished, and too
  much pollution will create impoverished soil that isn’t healthy enough

  While dross is a noun for stuff that's physically left over or
  useless, like the nonmetallic stuff left when metal gets refined, it's
  also used for people and forms of art. A really bad movie can be
  called dross, and a low or despicable person can be dross. Debris, or

  verb
   1. restrain with chains or manacles, typically around the ankles.
      "a ragged and fettered prisoner"


  A fetter is a shackle or chain that is attached to someone’s ankles.
  To fetter someone is to restrict their movement, either literally or
  metaphorically. You might feel fettered by your parents' rules, even
  without the chains.

  A fetter is anything that secures and limits the movement of the feet
  and legs of a prisoner. To fetter, the verb, could be used literally:
  the prison wardens would fetter the chain gangs who built many of the
  railroads in the US., but it usually means something has been done to
  restrain someone’s behavior: "we finally managed to fetter our sons’
  computer use with bribery."

      "the officer pursued the van"
   2. (of a person or way) continue or proceed along (a path or route).
      "the road pursued a straight course over the scrubland"


  Use the verb pursue when you're chasing after someone or something. A
  hungry lion might pursue a zebra, the paparazzi might pursue a
  celebrity, and a young dancer might pursue her dream of becoming a
  prima ballerina.

  Pursue originally meant "to follow with hostile intent," from a Latin
  root word, prosequi, "follow, accompany, follow after, or follow up."
  Today, when you pursue someone, it's not necessarily with bad
  intentions. A police officer, for example, might pursue a criminal,

 errand

  поручение

  noun
   1. поручение (commission, errand, mission, message, charge, procuratory)
   2. командировка (business trip, mission, assignment, detached duty, official journey, errand)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a short journey undertaken in order to deliver or collect something, often on someone else's behalf.
      "she asked Tim to run an errand for her"


  An errand is a short trip to fulfill some small business. When you’re
  running errands, you’re making a bunch of these all at once.

  The noun errand can refer to the mission of the trip itself. If the
  lines are always long at the bank, then banking may be your least
  favorite errand. If you are off on a wild goose chase, you may be out
  on a fool's errand. If you are taking food or clothing to someone in
  need, then you are on an errand of mercy.

  The blind quest for cash is a fool’s
  errand.

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a furtive and contemptible person.
      "he was branded a prying sneak for eavesdropping on intimate conversation"

  verb
   1. move or go in a furtive or stealthy manner.
      "I sneaked out by the back exit"

  adjective
   1. acting or done surreptitiously, unofficially, or without warning.
      "a sneak thief"


  The word sneak has many shades of meaning, but all involve doing
  something in a secretive or stealthy way. If you sneak home after
  midnight, that means you’re quietly creeping into the house so no one
  will hear you.

  In addition to moving furtively, sneak can also mean doing something
  secretly or slipping something in. You might sneak a cookie when no
  one is looking, or you might sneak your brother into a concert. You
  could even sneak a glance at that cute guy in your math class — you do
  it when you think no one will notice. Sneak has a noun form that
  describes a furtive person — someone who does a lot of sneaking.

  They sneak in if we’re not careful, if we just
  passively take in information and don’t make a conscious effort to
  control our attention (something we’ll learn about a bit further
  on)—especially if they are things that somehow pique our attention
  naturally: topics of general interest; things we can’t help but notice;
  things that raise some emotion in us; or things that capture us by some
  aspect of novelty or note.

   4. пикировать (dive, swoop down, nosedive, fall into a nosedive, dart downwards, pique)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a feeling of irritation or resentment resulting from a slight, especially to one's pride.
      "he left in a fit of pique"

  verb
   1. stimulate (interest or curiosity).
      "you have piqued my curiosity about the man"
   2. feel irritated or resentful.
      "she was piqued by his curtness"
   3. pride oneself.
      "He piqued himself on being so with them more than with any one else."

  noun
   1. stiff fabric, typically cotton, woven in a strongly ribbed or raised pattern.


  The verb pique means to make someone angry or annoyed. But when
  something piques your interest or curiosity, here the verb pique just
  means to arouse, stimulate, or excite.

  Both the noun and verb are pronounced "pēk" and were borrowed from a
  French word meaning "a prick, irritation," from Old French, from
  piquer "to prick." So you can see how something that pricks you could
  make you both excited and angry. But it's frustrating––enough to make
  you want to storm away from learning vocab. That storming away, by the
  by, might be called a "fit of pique."

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. a dish of ice cream with added ingredients such as fruit, nuts, syrup, and whipped cream.
      "Make individual pizzas for dinner, ice cream or yogurt sundaes for dessert and pancakes for breakfast."


  A sundae is a delicious ice cream concoction that might include hot
  fudge or caramel sauce, nuts, and whipped cream. You can order a
  sundae any day of the week.

  When you put ice cream in a dish, drip a sweet topping over it (like
  strawberry sauce or chocolate syrup), and add a dollop of whipped
  cream and a cherry, you've got a sundae. There are several competing
  stories about the origin of the sundae (and its name). One is that
  Illinois' outlawing of soda drinking on Sundays led to the dessert's
  invention. Several towns claim to be the sundae's birthplace,
  including New York City; Plainfield, Illinois; and New Orleans.

  adjective
   1. фаршированный (stuffed, farci)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. fill (a receptacle or space) tightly with something.
      "an old teapot stuffed full of cash"
   2. (of a man) have sexual intercourse with (someone).
   3. defeat heavily in sport.
      "Town got stuffed every week"
   4. used to express indifference toward or rejection of (something).
      "stuff the diet!"


  If something is stuffed, it's packed full of material, like the giant
  stuffed rabbit you won at the country fair. If a person is stuffed,
  she's had too much to eat.

  You might sit back after eating an entire pizza and murmur, "I'm
  stuffed." If you're stuffed up, you've got a bad cold and your head is
  stuffed with mucous. When objects are stuffed, it's usually because
  they're full of stuffing, like a stuffed armchair or a stuffed animal.
  It was once common to insult someone who was pompous but ineffectual
  by calling him a "stuffed shirt."

  It’s not as simple as getting one discrete

   1. a thing said or done that serves as a signal to an actor or other performer to enter or to begin their speech or performance.
      "The Mayor, not heeding his cue , began his speech early and failed to mention the conference and exhibition sponsors."
   2. a long, straight, tapering wooden rod for striking the ball in pool, billiards, snooker, etc..
      "When the cue hits the object ball it will bend the tangent line back away from the corner."

  verb
   1. give a cue to or for.
      "curious pedestrians are cued by the arrival of stretch limousines"
   2. use a cue to strike a ball in pool, billiards, snooker, etc..
      "‘I missed a few easy balls today but I am cueing brilliantly,’ he said."


  A cue is the long stick used for playing pool. A cue is also a
  reminder or stimulus to do something.

  In pool, you use the cue to hit the white ball into the red ball,
  aiming for a pocket. Other cues make things happen too. In acting, a
  lighting change or another actor's line could be a cue for you to
  enter the stage. During rehearsal, the actors need to learn their cues
  to make sure their timing is right. A cue can also be a clue or
  reminder of something. Anytime someone has good timing, they're on
  cue.

  What’s more, the
  more cues we have, the better the likelihood of successful retrieval.

  verb
   1. give solace to.
      "I see religion as only a way of asking unanswerable questions, of sharing the joy of a community of quest, and solacing one another in our ignorance."


  If something eases your disappointment or grief, consider it a solace.
  If you're sad, you might find solace in music or in talking to your

  It is no surprise that consolation and solace are similar in meaning
  as they share a root in the Latin verb sōlārī "to comfort." In fact,
  solace and consolation are synonyms meaning relief from grief or
  disappointment. When you go to sleepaway camp, your parents will miss

  If you discover late Sunday night that the dog really did eat your
  homework, you might cry out in dismay. Dismay describes an emotional
  state of alarm, fear, or serious disappointment.

  The first part of dismay comes from the Latin prefix dis-, which comes
  in handy when you want to put a negative spin on words (dishonest,
  discount, disenchant, etc.). The last bit of dismay most likely comes
  from the Germanic word magan, meaning "to be able to." You can employ
  the word dismay to describe how you feel in a variety of negative
  situations that you doubt you are able to handle.

   3. stir (a liquid, especially beer while brewing).

  When someone calls out "rise and shine," they are trying to rouse you,

  It's thought that the word rouse was originally a 15th-century term
  used by hawkers for the way the birds shook out their feathers when
  agitated. That gives a nice mental picture to the word, and it does
  fit: rouse means to become awake, excited, or just plain keyed up,
  like those birds ruffling their feathers. Consider that when first
  roused in the morning, many people have to shake themselves to get
  ready to face the day.

  your walls, your taste in art could also be described as morbid.

  The Latin roots of the word abstruse are about concealing or hiding

  someone is deliberately making a story or a situation more complicated
  than necessary. It sounds and looks like obtuse, but abstruse is

  noun
   1. a dessert of fruit baked with a crunchy topping of brown sugar, butter, and flour.
      "rhubarb crisp"


  Something that's crisp is thin, dry, and breakable. Unless they're
  stale, most crackers are crisp.

  Gingersnaps are crisp, and so is toast — in fact, crisp often
  describes food, although crunchy snow and dry, brown leaves are also
  crisp. To crisp something is to cook or dry it until it's brittle, and
  when a voice is crisp, it's abrupt and no-nonsense. A crisp fall
  morning is fresh and cold. In Old English, crisp meant "curly," from
  the Latin crispus, "curled." The "brittle" definition is probably
  imitative, the word sounding like its meaning.

   7. разборчивый (legible, picky, choosy, discriminating, fastidious, dainty)
   8. привередливый (fastidious, choosy, fussy, particular, choosey, dainty)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. delicately small and pretty.
      "a dainty lace handkerchief"
   2. fastidious or difficult to please, typically concerning food.
      "a dainty appetite"

  noun
   1. something good to eat; a delicacy.
      "Still lifes usually show beautiful vessels filled with wine and appetizing fruit or other dainties invitingly arranged on lovely china."


  Dainty means tiny, delicate, and lovely, so you could describe a
  little china tea set as dainty, and you could also call the tiny cakes
  on the little plates dainty.

  The original meaning of dainty, back in the 1300s, was "choice morsel
  of food," and it's still used that way to talk about a delicacy or a
  treat. More often, dainty is used as an adjective to describe
  something that's delicate and lovely. It's a compliment, unless it's
  used sarcastically to mean "someone who acts ridiculously prissy." An
  example would be to say, "Sorry I hurt you when I barely brushed
  against you. I didn't realize you were so dainty."

  She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and
  dressed in the most perfect taste.

  любезный

  adjective
   1. любезный (kind, dear, amiable, gracious, accommodating, polite)
   2. дружелюбный (friendly, amiable, amicable, outgoing, genial)
   3. добродушный (genial, amiable, easygoing, debonair, clever, good-natured)
   4. благожелательный (benevolent, friendly, amiable, kind, well-disposed, well-minded)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. having or displaying a friendly and pleasant manner.
      "an amiable, unassuming fellow"


  A friendly, pleasant person could be described as amiable. Airline
  flight attendants tend to be amiable. The people monitoring the
  school's cafeteria? Maybe not.

  An amiable person is good-natured and easy to get along with. Add one
  letter and you get amicable, a word with a common ancestor (Latin
  amicabilis) and a similar meaning. But while amiable refers to
  friendly people, amicable refers to friendly relations between them;
  two amiable people who no longer want to be married to one another
  might have an amicable divorce.

  поведение

  noun
   1. поведение (behavior, conduct, demeanor, actions, action, bearing)
   2. манера вести себя (demeanor, demeanour)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. outward behavior or bearing.
      "a quiet, somber demeanor"


  Your demeanor is defined as being either your facial appearance or
  your behavior. When playing poker, don't let your demeanor give away
  how good your cards are.

  Demeanor in English today has evolved from Middle English and Old
  French to refer to the way one manages or presents oneself, and this
  definition applies to conduct as well as facial expressions. The way
  you present yourself often affects how others make judgments about you
  and therefore, you might want your demeanor to reflect the situation
  you're in. So, if you're at a birthday party, your demeanor should be
  happy and smiling!

  adjective
   1. предстоящий (coming, forthcoming, impending, ahead, oncoming, toward)
   2. грозящий (threatening, impending, imminent, impendent, fulminatory)

  DEFINITION

  verb
   1. be about to happen.
      "my impending departure"


  If something is impending, it is about to happen. If you hear thunder
  in the distance, you might go inside to escape the impending storm.

  The word impending often refers to something threatening or
  frightening: impending doom, impending disaster. Something that is
  impending hangs over you — you might say, "I was so distracted by
  thoughts of my impending failure in my exams, I couldn't study." A
  synonym is imminent.

  Or, maybe Joe Stranger is actually Jane Stranger and her hair is
  dyed the same shade of blue as your childhood best friend dyed her hair
  right before you stopped talking to each other, and you always thought
  the hair was the first sign of your impending break, and now all of a
  sudden, all of these memories are clogging your brain and coloring the
  way you see this new person, innocent Jane.

   2. блуждающий (wandering, errant, floating, straying, migratory, erratic)
   3. сбившийся с пути (wayward, errant, aberrant, misled)
   4. заблудший (erring, stray, errant)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. erring or straying from the proper course or standards.
      "he could never forgive his daughter's errant ways"
   2. traveling in search of adventure.
      "that same lady errant"


  Something or someone described as errant has gone astray or done wrong
  by going in an unexpected direction. An errant bird might end up in
  northern Canada while his friends fly to southern Mexico for the
  winter.

  Although errant is commonly used as a synonym for "misbehaving" or
  "naughty," it also refers to things that are just out of place. An
  errant bomb can hit a house instead of an army base, and an errant
  lock of hair can get in your eyes. Errant can be intentional, as in
  "the errant boys skipped school to go to the movies," or
  unintentional, as in "an errant snowball hit your neighbor instead of
  your arch enemy."

  You only
  happened to remember your ex–best friend, for instance, because of an
  errant streak of hair.

  DEFINITION

  adjective
   1. resistant to a particular infection or toxin owing to the presence of specific antibodies or sensitized white blood cells.
      "they were naturally immune to hepatitis B"


  To be immune to something is to be resistant to it. If you had
  chickenpox as a child, you should be immune to it now.

  The adjective immune comes from the Latin word immunis, which means
  “exempt from public service.” If you're protected — or exempt — from
  disease, injury, work, insults, or accusations, then you're immune.
  Vaccinations serve to make people immune to certain diseases. Being a
  diplomat makes people immune to certain legal persecution. To be
  immune to bullying means that you don’t let the bad behavior of your
  peers get you down.

  Hardly anyone is immune altogether.

      "Had the wall run due north from this point on the upper terrace, the area enclosed would have been overlooked by a salient of the terrace to the east, creating a point of great vulnerability."


  If something stands out in a very obvious way, it can be called
  salient. It's time to find new friends if the differences between you

  Salient, from the Latin verb salire "to leap," was originally used in
  English to refer to leaping animals such as a frog or deer and may
  still be used this way. Often, however, it is used in math or
  geography to mean protruding. A salient angle juts outward rather than
  inward. Figuratively, it means noticeable or prominent. When giving an
  argument, make your most salient points at the beginning or the end.

  Fleeting is an adjective that describes something that happens really

  Driving in a car on the highway, you see a unicorn in the woods, but
  you only get a fleeting glimpse of it because you’re driving too fast.
  Bummer. Fleeting comes from the Old English word flēotan, which means
  “float, swim.” Like a ghost ship floating by on a foggy night,
  fleeting things disappear as fast as they appear. Fleeting love may
  last more than a moment, but it won’t stay for very long, and that’s
  why it’s called fleeting.

  Just as a fleeting impression of competence can form the basis of a
  political vote, so Watson’s initial overwhelmingly positive assessment
  of Mary lays the foundation for further action that reinforces that
  initial view.

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the fact of being primary, preeminent, or more important.
      "the primacy of air power in the modern war"
   2. the office, period of office, or authority of a primate of certain churches.
      "But do we really need another in-house hassle over papal primacy versus episcopal collegiality?"
   3. the fact of an item having been presented earlier to the subject (especially as increasing its likelihood of being remembered).
      "the primacy effect is thought to reflect recall from a long-term memory store"


  Something with primacy has first importance. If you are deciding who
  to take on an all-expenses-paid trip up the Amazon, the quality of
  being chill and fun might take primacy over the number of years you've
  been friends.

  Primacy comes from primary, meaning first, and it is like a condition
  of always having first place. If you are the teacher’s pet, you might
  have primacy over your classmates. You can also talk about primacy
  within a field. Madonna, Beyonce, and Shakira have all at one time or
  another achieved primacy in the field of pop music. Keep practicing,
  maybe you'll be next.

  His judgments from here on out will be influenced strongly

[2018-05-20 Sun 20:42]

Choose the adjective benevolent for someone who does good deeds or
shows goodwill. If your teacher collects homework with a benevolent
smile, she's hoping that you've done a good job.

Benevolent comes from the Latin bene "well" and volent from the verb
"to wish" so you can imagine that this word brings goodness with it. A
benevolent society is a charity group organized to serve a community
through programs, sponsorships and donations. The expression,
benevolent dictatorship, may seem like an oxymoron, but it is a
political term for an authoritative government that works for the good
of the people under its rule.

* industrious :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 11:52]

If someone comments that you are very industrious, they are
complimenting you for working hard and tirelessly. You can have the
evening to yourself if you're industrious enough during the afternoon
to get your homework and chores done.

The word industrious is closely related to the word industry, used for
both the quality of being hardworking, “He is a model of industry,” as
well as a field of business, "the construction industry." It might
help to remember the Industrial Revolution, the time when machinery
was introduced to the manufacturing world. If you're industrious, you
work as hard as machines do!

* envious :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 11:53]

Envious is another way to say jealous or resentful — in other words,
you want what someone else has, whether it's charming good looks or
the last chocolate frosted donut.

Once upon a time, envious meant “eager to emulate.” Now a days this
adjective is used to describe covetous feelings or a state of painful
desire. Envious usually isn't a good thing to be; it's better to let
it go and be happy with what you've got. Just remember the words of
the wise Greek philosopher Antisthenes: "As iron is eaten away by
rust, so the envious are consumed by their own passion."

But what if I
was about to continue the statement with, “envious and stubborn”?
* markedly :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 11:56]

If something happens in a significant way or to a great degree, you
can say it occurs markedly. If the price of milk rises markedly,
you'll notice it the next time you're grocery shopping.

When the acting on your favorite bad TV show improves markedly, you
might guess that all the actors took acting lessons over the summer.
And if the speed limit in your city is markedly lowered, you'll feel a
lot safer riding your bike around town. The adverb markedly comes from
marked and its sense of "having a mark," from the Old English mearc,
"sign or mark."

And yet, when study participants heard one of the two descriptions and
were then asked to pick which of two traits best described the person
(in a list of eighteen pairs from which they always had to choose one
trait from each pair), the final impression that the two lists
produced was markedly different.
* imaginative :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 11:58]

To be imaginative is to be inventive and original. If you enjoy coming
up with stories, writing songs, or just thinking about things in new
ways, you’re an imaginative person.

Great painters, musicians, and writers are imaginative. However, being
imaginative isn’t just limited to the arts. When you're imaginative,
you can develop a unique solution to a problem or issue. For example,
an imaginative engineer might develop a new, more efficient way to
construct a bridge. An idea or object that’s fresh and original — like
that bridge the engineer designed — can also be described as
imaginative.

* admonition :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 12:00]

Bringing a skateboard to school is a great way to get an admonition
from a teacher not to ride it down the halls. An admonition is advice
with a hint of scolding, a warning not to do something.

When you're cautioned or warned about some mistake you might be just
about to make, or some looming danger, you're receiving an admonition.
The strength and tone of an admonition determine whether it's a
gentle, polite suggestion or more of a stern warning. In Scotland, an
admonition is an official legal term that means a verbal punishment
for someone who's been found guilty but set free.

And thereafter follows his admonition to be careful lest personal
qualities overtake your judgment.
* imbuing :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 12:01]

To imbue is to fill up with or become "soaked" in an idea or emotion,
as a sponge takes in water. One visit to Africa might be enough to
imbue ambitions in a medical student to return to heal the sick.

You can use imbue in a similar way as "saturate," or "soak through,"
to describe a filling or absorbing. A "hue" is a color, and it rhymes
with imbue. When you're imbued with something, you are, in a way,
colored by it. If you imbue a dish sponge with oily orange water from
a spaghetti bowl, the color and the oil soak in. To fill people with
qualities or emotions is, for example, to imbue them with strength or
optimism.

In that statement, Watson has gone from objective observation to
subjective opinion, imbuing physical facts with emotional qualities.
* disregards :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 12:03]

If everyone at the city council meeting tends to disregard anything
that's said by the eccentric gentleman with the parrot on his
shoulder, it means that no one pays any attention to him.

To disregard something is to ignore it, or to deliberately pay it no
attention. Sometimes the word is used to mean "neglect," implying that
something important is not being taken care of. Disregard can also be
a noun; you could complain that your family has a complete disregard
for your privacy when they gather outside your bedroom door to
eavesdrop on your telephone conversations.

Holmes may even acknowledge the objective nature of her attractiveness
(though if you’ll recall, Watson begins by saying that Mary’s has
“neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion”), but he
disregards the observation as irrelevant in almost the same breath as
he perceives it.
* perceives :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 12:04]

When we perceive something, we become aware of or notice it. Sometimes
we perceive things by using our senses of sight, hearing, and smell.

Or we can use our mind to perceive things, which means that we are
able to recognize or understand them. We can also perceive a person or
thing as having certain qualities: Do you perceive yourself as a good
student? The Latin root percipere means "to receive, understand," from
the prefix per- "thoroughly" plus capere "to seize, take."

A loner is someone who prefers being alone to spending time with other
people. If you're a loner, you'd rather take a walk in the woods by
yourself than go to a party.

An extreme kind of loner is a hermit, a person who lives far from
society, completely alone, and doesn't interact with anyone. Other
loners are simply introverts, people who often need a break from
socializing and enjoy spending time on their own. Loner seems to have
appeared in the 1940s, originally in "Life" magazine's description of
baseball player Ted Williams as "something of a loner (who) refuses to
pal around with his teammates."

Holmes and Watson don’t just differ in the stuff of their attics—in one
attic, the furniture acquired by a detective and self-proclaimed loner,
who loves music and opera, pipe smoking and indoor target practice,
esoteric works on chemistry and renaissance architecture; in the other,
that of a war surgeon and self-proclaimed womanizer, who loves a hearty
dinner and a pleasant evening out—but in the way their minds organize
that furniture to begin with.
* womanizer :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 12:05]

If you've ever known a man who can't keep his eyes off every single
woman who walks by, you can call him a womanizer — especially if he's
constantly handing out his phone number.

A womanizer is a man who always seems to have a new girlfriend, and
who has no hesitation about starting up a new relationship before he's
ended the last one. Usually, these relationships are sexual and don't
last long. The noun womanizer comes from the verb womanize, which
originally meant "to make effeminate." By the late 1800s, the meaning
shifted to mean "to chase women."

Holmes and Watson don’t just differ in the stuff of their attics—in one
attic, the furniture acquired by a detective and self-proclaimed loner,
who loves music and opera, pipe smoking and indoor target practice,
esoteric works on chemistry and renaissance architecture; in the other,
that of a war surgeon and self-proclaimed womanizer, who loves a hearty
dinner and a pleasant evening out—but in the way their minds organize
that furniture to begin with.
* vying :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 12:09]

To vie for something means to compete for it. Two teams may vie for
the gold medal, but one will have to go home with silver.

Vie may be spelled the same as the French word, vie, but they are
pronounced differently, vī and vē respectively, and are not related in
meaning or history. English vie comes from the Latin verb meaning "to
invite" as in to invite a challenge. Be careful of the spelling which
includes an ie to y shift. “He intends to vie for the top prize,” but
“He is vying for the top prize.”

That means with both the furniture that exists already and the
potential furniture that is vying to get past the hippocampal gateway
and make its way into long-term storage.
* wit :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 12:12]

Wit is brainpower or mental ability, or the person who possesses such
ability, especially when it's used humorously.

When we are scared out of our wits, we — figuratively, anyway — lose
for a moment our mental faculties. When we are at our wits' end, we
have run out of ideas or possible solutions to a frustrating
situation. When we outwit someone, we make the smarter decision.
Historical figures known for their wit include Voltaire, Oscar Wilde,
and Mark Twain.

But only after she has bested him in a battle of wit, showing herself
to be a more formidable opponent, male or female, than he has ever
encountered.)
* formidable :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 12:13]

What do the national debt, your old gym teacher, and your
mother-in-law have in common? They're all formidable — that is, they
inspire fear and respect thanks to their size, or special ability, or
unusual qualities. (Or possibly all three in the case of your
mother-in-law.)

What's interesting about formidable is that we often tend to use it
about things that, while they may scare us, we can't help being pretty
impressed by all the same. A formidable opponent is almost by
definition a worthy one; a formidable challenge almost by definition
one worth rising to. Not surprisingly, this word is derived from the
Latin formidare, "to fear."

But only after she has bested him in a battle of wits, showing herself
to be a more formidable opponent, male or female, than he has ever
encountered.)
* scowl :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 12:16]

When you scowl you make an angry face. The angry face you make is also
called a scowl. Lighten up.

Scowl is an expressive word: it shares "ow" with frown, and if you say
it like you mean it you might end up scowling yourself. Being scowled
at is more unsettling than being frowned at. A scowl is like an angry
frown you would give someone if you disapproved of them. A frown
expresses sadness, but a scowl expresses disdain.

Does Joe have a scowl?
* mannerisms :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 16:44]

Does someone you know always shrug in a particular way or say "You
know what I mean?" at the end of every sentence? Well, that's a
mannerism, a habitual gesture or way of speaking.

Generally, we don't use then term mannerism as a critical term for our
friends' behavior, but when applied as a term of art criticism, it can
be a negative thing. If a critic talks about a writer's mannerisms,
for example, it's probably intended as an insult — suggesting they're
writing in a lazy or clichéd way. However, Mannerism, with a capital
"M," refers to a specific 16th-century Italian style of painting known
for its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) effects.

Now you can use the conversation to actually observe—physical details,
mannerisms, words.
* intrinsic :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 16:50]

The intrinsic qualities of something have to do with its nature. An
intrinsic quality of dogs is that they're loyal.

Anything intrinsic comes from within. Doing a job for only money is
not intrinsic. Doing a job because you love it is intrinsic; the
motivation comes from within. It's good to treat people as having
intrinsic value. If you like someone for intrinsic reasons, then you
have no other motivation. The opposite of intrinsic is extrinsic, for
things that come from the outside instead of from the inside.

In the case of Mary Morstan or Joe and Jane Stranger, elements of
physical appearance activated our biases, and these elements were an
intrinsic part of the situation.
* wholly :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 16:51]

Wholly is an adverb that means "entirely." If a story is wholly
inaccurate, no part of it is true.

Do you like to do things the whole way or whole hog, refusing any
halfhearted attempts? Then wholly is your kind of word — it means
completely, totally, or to the full extent. To give yourself over
wholly to the music at a concert means that you are focused
exclusively on the experience. If you're wholly committed to a goal,
you're going to give it 100% of your time and energy.

Even though they may be completely outside our awareness—in fact,
often for that very reason—and wholly irrelevant to whatever it is
we’re doing, they can easily and profoundly affect our judgment.
* profoundly :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 16:51]

If you’re profoundly moved by the last chapter of that novel you’re
reading, then you’re extremely moved — you feel it deep in your soul.

The adverb profoundly means something similar to “extremely,” with the
additional sense that it’s something intense and deeply felt. If
you’re profoundly confused, you’re very confused — confused in a way
that seems bottomless. The word can also describe something that
affects you greatly. If you’re profoundly influenced by the works of
Shakespeare, that means his writing shaped the whole way you think
about writing, whether you're working on plays, limericks, love
letters.

Even though they may be completely outside our awareness—in fact,
often for that very reason—and wholly irrelevant to whatever it is
we’re doing, they can easily and profoundly affect our judgment.
* prime                                                              :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 16:52]

If something is in its prime, it is at its best. The same goes for a
person. If you are young and healthy and in the prime of your life,
you are ready to take on the world.

Prime often means "main." The prime reason you go to concerts is to
see your favorite groups perform. If your mother is angry that you
came home late, tell her that this is a prime example of why you need
a cell phone — so you can call her. It can also mean "of the highest
quality" as in prime beef or flowers. As a verb, prime means to get
ready. Hopefully you've primed yourself for your exams. Prime the pump
and start the engine!

At every step, the environment primes us.
* impunity :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 16:54]

If doing something usually results in punishment, but you do it with
impunity, you will not be punished for the deed. Students are not
allowed to chew gum in school, but teachers do it with impunity. Not
fair!

The noun, impunity, comes from the Latin roots im- "not" plus poena
"punishment," a root which has also produced the word pain. Impunity,
then, is the freedom from punishment or pain. If someone has committed
a punishable offense but does not have to fear punishment, he or she
does it "with impunity." Cybercriminals operate with impunity from
some Eastern European countries.

I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of
their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed
there.”
* exhilarating :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 16:56]

Something exhilarating is so exciting it makes you a little giddy.
"Snowboarding that black-diamond trail was exhilarating!"

Zipping through the snow is certainly exhilarating, but ski bunnies
and snowboarders might not choose this fancy adjective first. They
might just yell, "Woohoo!" It's always been a fun-loving word; its
Latin roots mean "gladden, cheer." A ride on a glass elevator with a
cute vampire could be exhilarating, and so could a surprise party, or
a ride on an old roller coaster. It can be so refreshing, you can't
exhale after something exhilarating happens.

The sun is shining brightly, but there’s “an exhilarating nip in the
air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.”
* nip :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 16:57]

A nip is a tiny bite, a cold feeling, or a strong taste on your
tongue. It’s also a verb for pinching or biting something, but not
always in a bad way.

Being nipped now and then isn’t a big deal. If a puppy nips your
finger, no worries. The cold morning nip when you get out of bed is
uncomfortable, but put on socks and you’re fine. Nipping can be a good
thing sometimes, like in the phrase “nip it in the bud,” which means
stopping a poor behavior or activity when it first starts. A nip can
also mean a small sip of something, like hot chocolate — which is a
good idea if you’re feeling a nip of a cold draft.

The sun is shining brightly, but there’s “an exhilarating nip in the
air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.”
* extraneous :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 16:59]

Extraneous means coming from the outside, like the extraneous noise
you hear when you're in a theater and a train passes by. Extraneous
can also mean not relevant or essential, like all the extraneous
information in your long-winded science report.

In Latin, extra means outside, as in extraordinary "outside the
ordinary," or extraterrestrial 'coming from outside earth.' (Bonus
points––ding! ding!––if you knew that terra is Latin for "earth.") The
meaning of extraneous also extends to more abstract things that come
from the outside: extraneous details are ones that don't matter.

But that mindset, as it happens, is altogether extraneous in forming
other judgments.
* oblivious :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 17:05]

If you don't notice or aren't aware, it means that the adjective
oblivious applies to you!

When we think of the adjective oblivious, it is usually in situations
that involve being totally unaware of what's staring us right in the
face. It can also mean being forgetful and absent-minded. The cartoon
character Mr. Magoo is a perfect example of someone who is oblivious;
his eyesight is so bad that he always gets himself into various
scrapes and mishaps. For example, Mr. Magoo mistakes an airplane for a
theater and instead of watching a movie, he takes a seat on a
departing airplane!

Holmes, on the other hand, is oblivious to the weather—he has been
engrossed in his newspaper for the entire train ride.
* engrossed :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 17:06]

When you’re engrossed in something, you’re so consumed by it that you
don’t notice anything else, like when you’re engrossed in a
conversation with that cute girl from your math class.

Use the adjective engrossed to describe someone who is completely
absorbed in something, whether it’s a task, a person, or an object.
You might be engrossed in a movie that’s so good you just can’t look
away, or you can be engrossed in talking to someone — like the girl
from math class. Engrossed is often used with “in” — so you’d say you
were “engrossed in” a book or “engrossed in” your homework.

Holmes, on the other hand, is oblivious to the weather—he has been
engrossed in his newspaper for the entire train ride.
* preoccupied :Holmes:
[2018-05-21 Mon 17:09]

When you're preoccupied, you're completely focused on whatever it is
that you're doing. It's good to be preoccupied when you're driving, as
long as you're preoccupied with the road and not with your cell phone.

Have you ever been so preoccupied with another person that you
couldn't hear or see anyone else when you were in the same room as
them? Well, it sounds like you were in love! You can be preoccupied
with a person, a place, or even a hobby, like collecting baseball
cards or seashells. Preoccupied can also mean that you are wrapped up
in your own thoughts, which is good if you find yourself to be the
most amusing person in the world.

Unlike
Watson, he is understandably anxious and preoccupied.
* jettisoning :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 13:58]

Jettison means to push to the side or toss away. If a boat is leaking
or an airplane is running out of fuel, you can buy more time by
jettisoning cargo, or throwing it overboard.

The word jettison — dating, in its nautical meaning, from the 15th
century in English — is commonly used figuratively as well as
literally. You can jettison a friendship or an attitude. During the
month that the Winter Olympics are aired on TV, figure-skating fans
across the country jettison homework and other responsibilities in
order to watch.

From
inverting responsibility to jettisoning the entire concept of “success,”
we need to change the rules.
* climax :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 14:01]

When something — like a movie or piece of music — reaches its most
important or exciting part, that's the climax. A climax is a high
point.

When you're on a roller coaster and you reach the highest point,
that's the climax of the ride. This word is also used often in art and
entertainment. In an adventure movie, there's usually a moment near
the end when there's a lot of danger, suspense, and action — a point
the whole movie has been building towards. That's the climax. After a
climax, tension is released and things calm down. After a climax, you
probably want to say "Whew!"

Unlike other full-time athletes, he will
never have to return to a dead-end job after his moment of glory, nor
will he look back at this day as the climax of his only passion.
* commemorative :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 14:04]

Anything that acts as a memorial to something or someone is
commemorative — whether it's an action like a charity walk or an
object like a war memorial.

Certain commemorative objects are known simply as commemoratives.
Think, for example, of the Elvis Presley commemorative stamps your Dad
keeps in his sock drawer (he was young once), or the commemorative
coins minted for such events as the inauguration of a new President or
the moon landing. See late night TV in particular for "special
commemorative offers."

Right next to the Elvis Presley commemorative edition, you
can buy stamps with his face on them.
* perks :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 14:05]

A perk is something extra you get, in addition to a salary, in
exchange for working. The major perk of your job at an ice cream shop
might be all the hot fudge sundaes you can eat.

Some fairly common job perks include health insurance, free gym
memberships, and company cars. You can also talk about the perks, or
benefits, of a situation: "I have to ride to school with my annoying
neighbor, but the perk is she always brings donuts." As a verb, perk
means "to become more energetic or cheerful." So that donut perk? It
might be just the thing to perk you up on a Monday morning.

Fame has its perks, as does looking outside the choices presented to
you.
* intrinsic :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 14:07]

The intrinsic qualities of something have to do with its nature. An
intrinsic quality of dogs is that they're loyal.

Anything intrinsic comes from within. Doing a job for only money is
not intrinsic. Doing a job because you love it is intrinsic; the
motivation comes from within. It's good to treat people as having
intrinsic value. If you like someone for intrinsic reasons, then you
have no other motivation. The opposite of intrinsic is extrinsic, for
things that come from the outside instead of from the inside.

Julie’s goal made intrinsic sense: come back with the same number of
children she had left with.
* aisle :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 14:08]

An aisle is a passageway, often between seating areas or shelves.
Brides walk down aisles in between church pews, while you might head
to the cookie aisle in the supermarket.

An aisle is essentially a passageway between something. You have to
walk down an aisle to reach your seat at a theater or concert hall, to
get to your seat on a crowded airplane, or to reach the produce at
your local supermarket. The ai in aisle is pronounced like a long i,
so the word sounds like isle rather than ail.

She reclined in her seat and glanced across the aisle past her sleeping
husband, Marc, counting as she had done thousands of times—one, two,
three.
* recouping :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 14:09]

To recoup is a kind of recovery: If you lost some money but then made
that amount back, you recouped your loss.

When you recuperate, you get better after being sick. And when you
recoup something, you get better or bounce back after a loss.
Businesses that lose money try to recoup it by throwing a sale or
cutting their budget. If a runner falls behind in a race but then
speeds up to the front of the pack, he's recouped his lead. In some
cases this word also means "to reimburse."

Of course, recouping their initial investment had been part of the
plan.
* convince :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 14:11]

"How again was it that you convinced me to do this?" the boy said to
his friend before they jumped out of the plane on their first sky
dive. Convince means to talk someone into something, or win someone
over.

A person convinces by making an argument—you can convince your parents
to let you go to the movies by promising you'll do all your homework
the next day. A thing can convince as well. The cash prize convinced
me to enter the contest. The threat of failure convinced the kids to
study.

The rationalizations, legitimate or not, would just continue to add up
and make it harder to convince herself that escape was possible.
* forbid :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 14:19]

When you forbid something, you refuse to allow it. You might have
heard your parents say things like, "I forbid you to play ball in the
house!" or "I forbid you to have any more parties when we're not
home!"

Forbid comes from the Old English word forbeodan, meaning "forbid,
prohibit." Forbid can also mean "prevent" or "keep from happening."
The spare tire on your car will forbid you from driving any faster
than 40 miles an hour — any faster and the car will shake. You may
have heard forbid used in the expression "God forbid . . ." This
refers to something you hope will not happen, so much so that you're
asking God for a little help.

God forbid.
* dare :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 14:20]

When you challenge or provoke someone to try something risky, it's a
dare. If you accept a dare, you're probably trying to prove how brave
you are.

When you challenge your friend to a dare, you dare him. You might, for
example, dare your brother to jump off the garage into a pile of
leaves. Another way to dare is to actually be brave: "I admire her so
much, because she dares to stand up to bullies." The Old English root
of dare is durran, "to brave danger, venture, or presume." If you say,
"How dare you?" you're expressing outrage or indignation.

That seemed a bit dangerous, considering I did it on a dare and had
four weeks of preparation.
* divergent :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 14:58]

Something divergent is moving away from what is expected. Two
divergent paths are moving in opposite directions — away from each
other.

Things that are divergent are diverging — moving away from a path or a
standard. A teacher who comes to work in a clown outfit is being
divergent; a clown who comes to work in a business suit is also being
divergent. A stream is divergent if it is moving in the opposite
direction of a river. A politician who is divergent might leave his
political party. Divergent people and things are changing course —
moving off the beaten path.

From Japan to Monaco, from globetrotting single mothers to
multimillionaire racecar drivers, the basic rules of successful NR are
surprisingly uniform and predictably divergent from what the rest of
the world is doing.
* reservoir :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 14:59]

The word reservoir refers to a place where large amounts of water get
stored. It can also be used to describe great amounts of other things,
such as when you refer to a trivia expert as a reservoir of useless
knowledge.

The word reservoir comes from the French réservoir, which further
derives from the Old French reserver, meaning "to reserve." Knowing
this, it makes sense that the meaning evolved into a place, either
man-made or natural, where water is stored or "reserved," usually for
distribution for drinking, irrigating, and generating power.
Remembering the related word reserve might also help in both the
spelling and pronunciation of the word, as reserve is spelled (and
pronounced) with "er," the same as "reservoir."

It should be viewed as nothing more than a hedge against the absolute
worst-case scenario: in this case, becoming physically incapable of
working and needing a reservoir of capital to survive.
* redemption :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:00]

Redemption is the buying back of something. You might try for
redemption by attempting to buy back a bike you sold, or you might
attempt to buy back your soul after you steal someone else’s bike.

Redemption comes from the Latin word redimere, a combination of
re(d)-, meaning “back,” and emere, meaning “buy.” Redemption is what
some people claim happens to your soul when you're saved from evil
forces. You might pray for redemption — to the tooth fairy, to Zeus,
or to some other kind of invisible being — in the hopes that an
all-powerful being can save your soul. Redemption can also refer to
the repayment of a debt.

Retirement as a goal or final redemption is flawed for at least three
solid reasons:
* chump :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:03]

A chump is a sucker or a fool — someone who is very gullible. If a con
artist cheats you out of money, you may end up feeling like a chump.

Chump is a very informal word for someone who falls for every trick
and scheme, or who believes everything you tell them. If you get an
email from an African prince asking for your bank account information
so he can give you a lot of money, and you respond excitedly, ready to
collect the cash, you're a chump. This meaning of chump first appeared
in the 1880s — earlier, the word meant "short, thick piece of wood."

Even one million is chump change in a world where traditional
retirement could span 30 years and inflation lowers your purchasing
power 2–4% per year.
* defeat                                                             :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:04]

Defeat is the opposite of victory. When you lose, you suffer defeat.
When you win, you defeat your enemy.

This is a word that's all about losing. In World War II, America and
the Allies defeated the Axis powers: we beat them. In basketball,
Michael Jordan usually defeated his opponents. Any loss can be called
a defeat. When you're disappointed or think that nothing is going
right, you feel defeated. If you're determined to win, you could say,
"I won't accept defeat!" Some people are so stubborn that even though
they've obviously been defeated, they won't admit defeat.

Kinda defeats the purpose of waiting, doesn’t it?
* thrive :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:06]

To thrive is to do well or flourish. If your new cookie delivery
business thrives, you'll be rolling in dough — not literally, of
course.

The verb thrive means to flourish or grow vigorously, and it can be
applied to something like a business or to something or someone's
actual health. Plants can thrive in a greenhouse, and children can
thrive if they eat well and exercise. Thriving can also be used more
figuratively — "The women thrived on gossip; they loved knowing who
was dating or divorcing whom."

Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive, let
alone thrive.
* endurance :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:06]

Endurance is the power to withstand something challenging. If you
decide to run a marathon, you will need lots of endurance to run over
26 miles.

The noun endurance contains endure, which means "to suffer or undergo"
and the suffix -ance means "the state of." It can be used to describe
the physical strength to keep going, as in a marathon or giving birth,
but it can also be used when discussing an exhausting mental situation
or stressful time — the endurance to bounce back from heartbreak,
perhaps.

Capacity, interest, and mental endurance all wax and wane.
* minutiae :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:11]

The tiny details of anything can be called minutiae. Minutia — which
you'll usually see as minutiae, the plural version — is a little like
trivia.

Notice how minutia almost has the word mini in it? That's a good clue
to the meaning, which is "small things or details." People who are
sports fans tend to love minutiae — like what a player's batting
average is, right down to the third decimal point. Anytime you're
dealing with itty-bitty details, you're looking at minutiae.

The size of your bank account doesn’t change this, nor does the number
of hours you log in handling unimportant e-mail or minutiae.
* conspire :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:12]

When you conspire, you collaborate with others to do harm, or maybe
just keep something from happening, like a group that conspires to get
tuna melts booted from the lunch menu by urging everyone to order
other things.

You can conspire with someone, meaning you team up with another person
to plot against someone else, or you can conspire against someone.
This means you devise a scheme to do that person harm. Conspire also
can be used in a more figurative sense to describe events that cause
problems, like bad weather that may conspire against your picnic
plans, or a series of injuries that conspire against a basketball team
struggling to make the playoffs.

The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of
its way to line up all the pins either.
* forgiveness                                                        :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:13]

Compassionate feelings for someone that make it easier to forgive that
person for some offense can be called forgiveness. Feelings of
forgiveness make it easier to feel empathy toward people who have
harmed you.

If you give someone a break and forgive some misdeed or mistake, you
are practicing the act of forgiveness. If your sister borrows your
favorite white sweater without asking, it's easy to offer her
forgiveness. If your sister borrows your favorite white sweater
without asking and spills a glass of chocolate milk on it, forgiveness
may be a little harder to grant.

Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission.
* chink                                                              :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:16]

A chink is a very narrow opening or crack. A chink in your bedroom
curtains might let enough early morning sunlight in that you'll wake
up before your alarm goes off.

Use the word chink to describe the slightest gap between slats in a
blind or crevice between two rocks on a cliff. Sometimes the light
that shows through this space is also called a chink; "Just a chink of
light shone beneath the shade on the airplane window." Chink comes
from the Old English cinu, "fissure," and the related cinan, "to crack
or split."

It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of
attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor.
* excess                                                             :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:17]

Excess is too much of something, like big-time overindulgence. Eating
to excess makes your stomach hurt, and spending to excess means you
can't pay your credit card bills.

Excess comes from the Latin word excessus meaning, "go out, going
beyond the bounds of reason," like eating and spending in excess. (Not
so reasonable.) Although it spends most of its time as a noun, it can
also be an adjective to describe "more than is required or needed,"
like when excess water spills over the top of the bathtub, or those
excess pounds spill over the top of your jeans.

Things in Excess Become Their Opposite.
* hindrance :Ferris:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:19]

A hindrance is something in the way, an obstacle. An untied shoelace
is a hindrance to walking, and tripping in the lunchroom might be a
hindrance to getting a seat at the cool table.

You might hear the phrase, "more of a hindrance than a help." It means
that something intended to be a positive force has the opposite
effect, like when your four-year-old sister tries to help you make
dinner. Hindrance refers to the act of slowing things down, or the
thing that's causing the problem, like your "helpful" little sister.
It's the noun form of the verb hinder, which is "to get in the way."

Help becomes hindrance.
* innocuous :Holmes:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:37]

Something that's innocuous isn't harmful or likely to cause injury.
Public figures like mayors and governors have to expect they'll get
critical or even hurtful emails and phone calls, as well as more
innocuous feedback.

The adjective innocuous is useful when you're talking about something
that doesn't offend or injure anyone. Innocuous remarks or comments
are meant kindly, and innocuous germs won't make you sick. An
innocuous question is innocently curious, rather than aimed to hurt
someone's feelings. The word comes from the Latin roots in-, "not,"
and nocere, "to injure or harm."

The words may seem innocuous enough, but hidden among them are the
so-called target stimuli: words like lonely, careful, Florida,
helpless, knits, and gullible.
* stimuli :Holmes:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:37]

A stimulus causes an action or response, like the ringing of your
alarm clock if you didn't sleep through it.

Stimulus is a word often used in biology — something that causes a
reaction in an organ or cell, for example. In financial and economic
contexts, a stimulus may be an incentive: the money you spend on your
membership is a stimulus for hitting the gym. Though it can be a
synonym for stimulant, they are not always used interchangeably. A
stimulant is often a chemical or drug that increases activity — think
caffeine. For more than one stimulus, use stimuli, not stimuluses.

The words may seem innocuous enough, but hidden among them are the
so-called target stimuli: words like lonely, careful, Florida,
helpless, knits, and gullible.
* gullible :Holmes:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:38]

If you are gullible, the joke is on you because you are easily fooled.

It is thought that gullible might be derived from the verb gull,
meaning "to swallow." This would be a funny coincidence as gullible
describes an overly trusting person who tends to swallow the stories
he hears whole. The related word, gull, can be used as a noun "don't
be such a gull!" or as a verb "you can't gull me into believing that!"

The words may seem innocuous enough, but hidden among them are the
so-called target stimuli: words like lonely, careful, Florida,
helpless, knits, and gullible.
* lump :Holmes:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:39]

If it's hard to determine its shape and otherwise looks like a big
blob of something, it's probably safe to call it a lump.

Jabba the Hut looks like a disgusting lump. So does the growing mound
on your noggin where you walked into the glass door. And if you've
been lumped together with a bad bunch, you might have been grouped
with people indiscriminately. But all lumps aren't bad. Little old
ladies put lumps of sugar into their tea. And that choked up feeling
you get during a sappy movie? That's just a lump in your throat.

If I lump them all together, they very well might remind you of old
age.
* hunch :Holmes:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:40]

When you pose for pictures with short friends, you hunch over so you
don't tower above them — you scrunch up your shoulders, bend your
knees, and try to look smaller.

You can also have a hunch, which has nothing to do with scrunching.
When you have a hunch about something, you think it might be true.
Your dog bolts over the fence, and you have a hunch he's heading for
the neighbor who feeds him pâté. Hunch is an odd word of unknown
origin, which seems to have originally meant "to push or shove" — to
nudge.

You will walk slower now than you did before, and you may even hunch
just a little (both evidence of the ideomotor effect of the prime—or
its influence on actual physical action).
* trump                                                              :Holmes:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:44]

To trump is to outrank or defeat someone or something, often in a
highly public way. Safety might trump appearance when you're buying a
car, or your desires may trump your brother's when it comes to making
weekend plans.

In the card game bridge, the trump card is the most powerful card in a
particular round and defeats all the others — sort of like when your
needs or wishes trump someone else's. Originally trump implied a
deceptive form of victory involving cheating, but that sense has been
largely lost, though it's still around in the term trumped up, meaning
something that's been falsely made up. A politician may face trumped
up charges that could ruin his career.

For Watson, it hardly matters and is soon trumped by the pretty sky
and the chirping birds.
* volition :Holmes:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:50]

When you do something voluntarily, you do it of your own volition, or
will. Doing something willingly, or because you agree to it, is doing
something of your own volition.

Volition comes from Latin and French roots meaning "wish" or "will."
Legal speech and writing often include the word volition, as a way to
affirm that a person involved in a crime acted "on their own
volition," or consented to be part of the crime. Maybe criminals don't
wish to go to jail, but their acts often show their volition to break
the law.

When we are aware of the reason for our action, it stops influencing
us: we now have something else to which to attribute whatever emotions
or thoughts may have been activated, and so, we no longer think that
the impetus is coming from our own minds, the result of our own
volition.
* superfluous :Holmes:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:57]

When something is so unnecessary that it could easily be done away
with, like a fifth wheel on a car or a fifth person on a double date,
call it superfluous.

Superfluous (soo-PER-floo-uhs) means "more than required." Use it when
pointing out something that could be removed without detracting from
the quality of something: "For a climb over a glacier, the very
thickest shoes are absolutely necessary; beyond these, all else seems
superfluous to me," wrote the adventurer Charles Stoddard in 1899. The
word comes from Latin and literally means "overflowing": super, "over"
+ fluere, "to flow." So you can think of a superfluous addition as
flowing over the boundaries of what's needed.

Is something superfluous to the matter at hand influencing my judgment
at any given point?
* susceptible :Holmes:
[2018-05-28 Mon 15:58]

If you are susceptible to something such as infections or earaches, it
means you are likely to become sick with these things.

Have you ever received something you don't want? Well, with
susceptible meaning "likely to be influenced or affected by" that is
probably going to be the case. If you're susceptible to flattery, and
someone wants something from you, all they have to do is give you a
compliment or two and you'll do what they want. Material that's
susceptible to cracking won't be in good condition for long.

It’s not that Holmes is not susceptible to priming; it’s that he knows
its power all too well.
