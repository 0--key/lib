How to Speak like a Brit in ten easy steps or ten unmistakable
signs that you're speaking like a British person or something
like that... from LetThemTalkTV.


1 You say ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT has many different meanings it can
mean HELLO "all right" and the response is the same
"all right" you try that.
So ALRIGHT means lots of things I guess it should be "Are you
alright?" but nobody says that we don't say the ARE YOU part in
fact we don't even say ALRIGHT often the L sounds more like a W
and the T is a glottal stop that's the sound you make from the
back of the throat when you are trying but you don't quite make a
T but it does depend on which part of the UK come from I'm from
London so I say AWRIGH' not ALL RIGHT. It means OK "Can you do
this for me?" ALRIGHT ALRIGHT shows concern. "You fell off your
scooter you alright Mate?" "I'm all right" it can mean
SO "Allright everybody let's begin"

2 you use CHEERS not just when drinking. Cheers can mean CHEERS
when you have a drink CHEERS of course but it also can mean thank
you
"ah! a matcha latte oh that's my favorite cheers mate"

or it can mean goodbye
"well I'm done for the day cheers everybody see you tomorrow."

3 You call people mate even when they're not your mate MATE we
love to say MATE especially among men but you hear it more and
more often from women too. Use it to talk about friendship

"Hello mate I haven't seen you in ages."

"You're my best mate. Am I your best mate?"

"Well you're in the top 20, probably"

use CHEERS MATE To say thank you.

"Yes I'll look after your cat Tiddles this weekend." - "Cheers mate you're a star."

Be careful though in some situations CHEERS MATE sounds
sarcastic

"You drank all my wine and then vomited on my Persian carpet
cheers mate."

to make and show surprise

"huh mate you should have seen her face when she found out the
big secret."

when someone wants to attract your attention in the
street they will often use MATE this is just for men
though

"Excuse me mate. How do I get to Trafalgar Square."

"oi mate, you dropped your your wallet over there." 
so if you want to get the attention of a British guy then don't
say "excuse me" or "excuse me sir "or "excuse me my friend"
say "excuse me mate." 

4 you employee understatement fairly often. So understatement is
presenting something as less important than it really is. Yes we
do use words like amazing, incredible, fantastic but often we
like to let others read between the lines. Being too emotional
can be seen as a bit vulgar by British people that's why we
employ words like fairly, quite, pretty, rather.

"You've just won ten billion euros on the lottery how do you
feel."

- "fairly pleased actually."

- "You've just finished running a double marathon in the desert,
how do you feel?"

- "Pretty tired to be honest."

"You've lost your job and your wife ran away with your best
friend all in the same week are you all right?"


"I'm quite upset actually."

"You've won the gold medal in world-record time."

"Yeah I'm rather pleased."


LetThemTalk in Paris is the best language school in the world OK
sometimes we don't use understatement.

5 use US to mean ME

so sometimes British people when they're talking in the singular
will use US instead of ME why we do this. I'm not sure I guess
we're being more indirect so it sounds a bit more polite but let
me show you what I mean here's some examples:


"Can you give us a minute? I just have to finish this email."
"Can you lend us Â£20 until next Thursday?"
"Oh give us a moment I'm just gonna finish this."
"Hello darling give us a kiss."


6 you laugh at double entendres.


Now double entendre is a French term that we use in English. Now
in French they don't say double entendre. So if you're French
please don't write angry comments to me I know it's not correct
French but that's what we say. So a double entendre is a
statement that has a double meaning and often the second meaning
is funny and sometimes a bit sexual or indelicate. For example "I
went to the market today and the woman in the fruit stall had
really big melons." One reason why we love Double entendres is
because a long time ago theatre, stage shows and later TV, was
censored. Obvious sexual content was forbidden and the way you
got around this was with innuendo and double entendre and they're
still popular today even without the censorship. I see her every
day at the vegan cafe she's eats cauliflower and peas (pees).
When I look through the telescope I can... When I look through
the telescope I can see Uranus. The man in supermarket was going
to give me a small bag so I shouted out "have you got a big one"
he looked embarrassed. Even Shakespeare loved double entendres he
used them often and if you want an example Google HAMLET, COUNTRY
MATTERS and you'll see what I mean. 7 You say bloody all the
bloody time British people like to use BLOODY. When we're
happy "That was bloody good." When we're angry. "You spilt my
pint you bloody bastard." When we're sad "I don't bloody believe
it! She left me for that bloody bloody idiot." when we're
surprised
"Bloody hell! that woman is a man maybe I should stop dating her." We can even put
bloody in the middle of a word abso-bloody-lutely and this is called
TMESIS. TMESIS and I think it's the only word in English language
which begins with TM. "Are you coming away with me to Goa?" oh yeah! absobloodylutely."
8 you are an expert at reading between the lines.
Now I've travelled quite a lot
and lived in a number of different countries and what I've noticed is that
reading between the lines is quite a British trait. So British people often
don't like to speak directly or in a confrontational way especially in formal
situations such as in a work environment. Other nationalities will often tell you
what they think while the British will circumvent conflict. Now this is a
generalization, a big generalization and I'm sure there are many, many exceptions
so tell me what you think anyway I guess I should give an example of that
so imagine I'm in a meeting how to solve the problem of pollution in
London so somebody gets up and says "Yeah I've got brilliant idea, we move London
to the countryside because there is no pollution there. An island off the north
coast of Scotland for example." A non-british response might be "that's a f**ing stupid
idea you're an idiot." but the British response might be "OK,
interesting, interesting we've got fairly busy agenda
now so let's talk about this another time."
9 you might say INNIT
British often say INNIT and this can be right or wrong grammatically speaking.
Now when INNIT means ISN'T IT then it's perfectly correct and I might use it
myself when I'm speaking informally. "It's hot innit?" "This is best pub in London, innit?"
"That's the thief, innit?" But now you're seeing INNIT used as a question tag for
everything and that sounds wrong. "He doesn't like bananas, innit?" "You're my
best friend, init?"...
no...no "He doesn't like bananas,
does he?" "You're my best friend, aren't you?" I guess if everyone is using
it then it's right that's what they say that's how language changes but I'm
having a hard time with this one.
10 Crime and PUNishment
So there was a Spanish magician and he said "UNO, DOS" and then he disappeared
without a TRES (trace). A pun is a play on words when two words sound the same or almost
the same and you can make a joke on it and British love them. If you don't
believe me then just look at the names of fish and chip shops in Britain for
example The Codfather, The plaice to be. Plaice is the name of fish of course. Frying
Nemo, the Fiscoteque, For Cod's sake. Newspapers love them too. Now a long time
ago in 1984 there was a dispute when British exporters of lamb were attacked
in France by French farmers who were unhappy with the cheap imports of
British lamb and they burnt the British lorries and the headlines of the Sun
newspaper was L'AMBUSH. Even though I'm not a fan of the Sun I must admit that
it's a brilliant pun on the words LAMB and AMBUSH and has the L apostrophe to
indicate the connection with France. I've tuned my ukulele and now I'm going to
tuna fish. So if you want to make English friends then make a pun and
what's the best day to do that Punday of course.
