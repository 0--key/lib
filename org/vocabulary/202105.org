[2021-05-03 Mon 08:03]

When you clip grass or other plants, you mow it. If you realize your
front lawn is taller than your dog, it might be time to mow it.

People with grassy lawns usually mow them throughout the growing
season, keeping them neatly trimmed and green. Farmers mow some food
crops and hay as well, when they're ready to be harvested, although
they use different tools to do it, including a curved blade called a
scythe. An old-fashioned meaning of mow is "a stack of hay," or "a
place where hay is stored."

As for the horses, they knew every inch of the field, and in fact
understood the business of mowing and raking far better than Jones and
his men had ever done.

* grudging :Farm:
[2021-05-03 Mon 08:06]

If you do something in a grudging manner (or grudgingly), you do it
with reluctance. Doing homework, paying taxes, and saying sorry are
all commonly done in a grudging manner.

"Grudging apology" and "grudging acceptance" are probably the two most
common uses of this word, which perhaps says something about our lack
of grace as a species. The word derives from the medieval French word
groucher, meaning "to murmur or mumble." A related word is grudge,
meaning a long-lasting sense of ill will dating to a previous
incident.

Every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was
truly their own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not
doled out to them by a grudging master.

[2021-05-03 Mon 08:08]

He had made an arrangement with one of the cockerels to call him in
the mornings half an hour earlier than anyone else, and would put in
some volunteer labour at whatever seemed to be most needed, before the
regular day’s work began.
* obstinate :Farm:
[2021-05-03 Mon 08:11]

When someone is beyond stubborn, use the word obstinate instead: "You
obstinate old mule! Get out of my way!"

While stubborn may have positive or negative connotations, obstinate
is most definitely negative, because it implies a kind of hard-headed
determination not to change your mind even when it might be best to
rethink your position. "The obstinate Man does not hold Opinions, but
they hold him," wrote Samuel Butler way back in the seventeenth
century. The word still does the trick if you want a put-down for
someone you think is being a pig-headed fool or a stick in the mud.

He did his work in the same slow obstinate way as he had done it in
Jones’s time, never shirking and never volunteering for extra work
either.

* muddle :Gideon:
[2021-05-13 Thu 18:22]

A muddle is something that's messy and confusing. If your bedroom
looks like a hurricane just hit it, you might describe it as a muddle.

Oftentimes, we create the muddles in our lives, so it’s appropriate
that muddle can be used as a verb meaning “to mix up” or “confuse.”
Conveniently, though, the word muddle also describes a way out of
difficult situations; to muddle through a troublesome task is to
somehow figure it out, even if you don’t quite know what you’re
doing. It has been suggested that muddle comes from an old Dutch word
meaning “to make muddy.”

No problem there we might use that - native speakers might say it
like that but you could use another word a native speaker might use an
advanced words such as MUDDLE or IN A MUDDLE I was in such a muddle
this morning I tried to put my trousers on my head and I stepped into
my hat. So this is just one example so words that native speakers or
advanced users will use. 26 words that will help your speaking and
help your comprehension coming right up so stay tuned.
* budge :Gideon:
[2021-05-13 Thu 18:26]

To budge is to move — but just a little bit. People can budge
physically from where they're sitting or standing, and people can
budge from opinions and positions too.

If a bunch of your friends are sitting on a bench, and they're taking
up too much space for you to sit, you could ask them to budge, meaning
"Move over!" If you hate eggs and refuse to eat them no matter how
they're cooked, you are refusing to budge from your anti-egg
policy. Budge is most often used in a negative way, as in "I won't
budge" or "They wouldn't budge." This word often applies to stubborn
people. Since budge means to move just a tiny bit, what's the big
deal? Someone who accuses you of not budging is basically saying you
should.

B is for BUDGE and this is a synonym of to move or change position and
we especially use it when we want to talk about people changing their
minds or their decisions so for example "we asked them to improve
their offer but they wouldn't budge." "We tried to convince the
President to resign but he wouldn't budge." You can also use it to
mean move something heavy "hey! can you help me budge the sofa." So
there you are you can use BUDGE instead of MOVE.
* comeuppance :Gideon:
[2021-05-13 Thu 19:18]

Comeuppance describes a fate or punishment that's deserved, like when
an arrogant trash-talking quarterback fumbles the ball on the last
play and loses the game for his team.

Comeuppance began as a term that meant "present oneself for judgment
by a tribunal." That was in 1859. You can picture an accused person
approaching a judge, or "coming up" to the front of a
courtroom. Guilt, innocence — comeuppance can be either, and it can
apply to things beyond the justice system. Nowadays you'll most likely
hear this word describe something bad. If someone gets a deserved
punishment, you'd say "He got his comeuppance."

C is for COMEUPPANCE which means a punishment or fate that someone
deserves "He's a dishonest guy now he's free but one day he'll get his
comeuppance and end up in prison."
* TODO dodge                                                            :sat:
* dodgy :Gideon:
[2021-05-13 Thu 19:18]

A dodgy situation is risky and suspicious. A dodgy person is skilled
in lying and deceiving. Neither should be trusted.

When a person or situation is called dodgy, it's a clue that they
should be dodged if at all possible. A job might be dodgy because it's
illegal or dangerous. A shortcut might be dodgy if it could damage
your car. Running a marathon without preparation is very
dodgy. Similarly, a dodgy person is untrustworthy because they’re
evasive, cunning, sly, or just a flat-out liar.

D is for DODGY. DODGY is a great word because it has so many uses. It
can mean suspicious or bad quality or strange for example: "it's got a
dodgy haircut" "There's a dodgy man outside". "My position in this
company is a bit dodgy: I might lose my job any minute."
* incite :Gideon:
[2021-05-13 Thu 19:21]

To incite is to cause to act or occur. Violent words can incite
violent actions which, in turn, might incite public outcry against
violence.

Incite comes from a Latin verb meaning "to move into action" and if
you incite someone to do something, that is exactly how to describe
it. Usually it is used in a negative context. Radical and intolerant
teachings can incite hatred in those who listen. And if a government
restricts its people too much, it can incite unrest and rebellion in
the population.

by the way egg on doesn't have anything to do with eggs. It comes from
an old-world Old Norse world EGGJA (not sure I'm pronouncing that
right) which means to incite and it's been in the English language
since around 1200.

* flustered                                                          :Gideon:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:08]

To be flustered is to lose your cool. When you're flustered, you're
embarrassed, agitated, or just confused.

If your pants fell down in the middle of class while you were giving a
presentation, you'd probably be flustered: highly embarrassed, out of
breath, and a little freaked out. It's hard to concentrate when you're
flustered — it's a distracting state of mind. Being flustered isn't
quite as bad as being panicked, but it's close. People can also get
flustered by good things, like if someone you had a crush on kissed
you.

F is for flustered. Flustered which means to be confused and nervous
at the same time. "I always get flustered when lots of people are
asking me lots of questions at same time."; "I was getting flustered
because my train was delayed and I thought I would miss my flight."
* galore                                                             :Gideon:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:09]

At a party with more cupcakes than anyone could imagine, you’ll hear
guests say, “There are cupcakes galore!”  Galore means there’s so much
that it’s unbelievable.

The Irish phrase go lear literally translates as “to sufficiency.”  If
there are sufficient enough bananas to build a house with them, you’d
say that there are bananas galore.  The word is an example of a
postpositive adjective, which means it comes after the word it
describes.  So when you go to a circus and 700 clowns surround you,
don’t say “There are galore clowns,” because the correct way to
express your terror is this: “There are clowns galore. Help!”

G is for galore isn't that beautiful word galore and galore comes from
Scottish Gaelic. There aren't many words in English language from
Gaelic but this is one of them and it just means a lot, much or many
but in a positive way. But the trick about galore is that it comes
after the noun. It's quite a literary and poetic word but it's common
enough so do use it for example "For my birthday everybody bought me a
bottle of whisky. So now I have whisky galore." whiskey is also a
Gaelic word which means water of life. So whisky galore is the only
phrase in the English language just using words from Gaelic. "I went
to the tech show and there were gadgets galore. Wonderful wonderful
gadgets."

[2021-05-17 Mon 17:19]

H is for hullabaloo now this means a lot of noise, a fuss, a
disturbance a commotion. For example "On the first day of the sales
there was quite a hullabaloo outside the shop just before it
opened". "I just wanted to get a refund but God what a hullabaloo they
made of it all."

[2021-05-17 Mon 17:19]

A commotion is a noisy disturbance. If you're trying to quietly
concentrate on reading this, you wouldn't want the person next to you
to cause a commotion, or it would distract you.

Commotion, which comes from the Middle French word commocion, means
"violent motion, agitation." It can be a disorderly outburst or
disruption, like someone yelling in the street at night, or five
people arguing about someone talking on a cellphone while a play is
being performed in front of them. Commotion can also describe
out-of-control movement, like people pushing and shoving to get to the
front row of a concert.

H is for hullabaloo now this means a lot of noise, a fuss, a
disturbance a commotion. For example "On the first day of the sales
there was quite a hullabaloo outside the shop just before it
opened". "I just wanted to get a refund but God what a hullabaloo they
made of it all."
* inkling                                                            :Gideon:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:22]

Is someone yapping on and on and you only have the vaguest idea of
what they're talking about? Then you understood just an inkling — a
glimmer, a fraction — of what they were saying.

Inkling can also mean a sly suggestion or faint implication. If
someone drops a hint you're not wanted they've given you an inkling
you're not wanted. The word comes from the medieval English word
inclen, which suitably enough means "to utter in an undertone." In
other words, what's really being said is in between the lines of
what's actually being said on the surface. By now you've probably got
the inkling that inklings can be sneaky things.

I is for inkling. Now inkling is another way of saying that you have a
feeling that something might happen or something is true an idea even
though you're not 100% sure. So for example "I have an inkling that
Jane might break up with Jim. Something she said gave me the
impression that she's not happy." "I have an inkling that Johnson had
something to do with the murder even though he denies it. Yes indeed I
think Johnson"
* jaunt :Gideon:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:23]

Running out to get pizza to bring back before the big game? This
short, quick, pleasurable trip could be called a jaunt (unless of
course, you get your pizza from Italy, that’s called “time to get a
closer pizza place”).

Jaunt was used in the 17th century to describe a journey on a horse
just long enough to tire the horse out. Nebraska has what they call a
Junk Jaunt, which is a yard sale that includes up to 40 towns and
stretches nearly 300 miles and draws up to 20,000 people. That’s more
than enough to make any horse tired, but they call it a jaunt
nevertheless.

J is for jaunt. Now jaunt is usually a noun and it means taking a
short trip for pleasure. For example "I say Samantha, do you fancy
taking a jaunt with me in my vintage Bugatti this Sunday." "I don't
travel much these days except for the occasional jaunt to visit my
family in Scotland"
* knack :Gideon:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:24]

If you have a knack for doing something, you do it well. You may have
a knack for baking cakes or a knack for cracking jokes. These things
come easy to you.

Although the noun knack refers to a special talent, the sense is that
it is a more innate talent — as opposed to a certain technique. So if
someone instinctively has a talent for fixing plumbing, for example,
you can say they have a knack for it. If, however, they unclog a sink
by having a wrench in one hand and a how-to book in the other, then
they may have the technique, but they probably don't have the knack.

K is for knack. knack means a skill or an ability or a talent.

* counterfeit :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:46]

A counterfeit is a fake or a forgery. If you painted an uncanny copy
of the "Mona Lisa" and tried to pass it off as the original, you'd
have a counterfeit on your hands.

An exact imitation of anything — a work of art, a ten dollar bill — is
a counterfeit, and the act of creating the fake copy is the verb to
counterfeit.  You can also describe the forgery using the adjective
form of counterfeit: a counterfeit Rolex watch. In Old French, the
word contre, "counter or against", together with the word faire, "to
make," joined together to mean "to make in imitation," which led to
our counterfeit.

Rationalization is a kind of epistemic forgery, if you will. When
others ask us to give reasons for our behavior, they’re asking about
our true, underlying motives. So when we rationalize or confabulate,
we’re handing out counterfeit reasons (see Box 5). We’re presenting
them as an honest account of our mental machinations, when in fact
they’re made up from scratch.

how many are counterfeit? Just how pervasive is our tendency to
rationalize?
* blue :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:47]

Among other things, blue is a color and a dreary mood. If the blue sky
and ocean have turned gray and stormy, you might be blue because your
day at the beach is ruined.

Whether it's a primary color or a saddened mood, blue is used often as
an adjective for people and things. Blue is a mix of green and purple
shades, and it's the favorite color of many. The color blue might
bring thoughts of first-place blue ribbons or police officers in blue
uniforms, and it colors many flags of the world. Blue is everywhere,
but there isn't a lot of blue food unless it's colored with dye. Even
blueberries are mostly purple.

Apart from their bizarre denials, these patients are otherwise
mentally healthy and intelligent human beings. But no amount of
cross-examination can persuade them of what’s plainly true—that their
left arms are paralyzed. They will confabulate and rationalize and
forge counterfeit reasons until they’re blue in the face.

“Oh, doctor, I didn’t want to move my arm because I have arthritis in

like moving my arm just now.”

* limp :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:48]

If you walk unevenly, you have a limp. Maybe you pulled your hamstring
at the annual Thanksgiving Day Football Showdown, or maybe one leg is
three inches shorter than the other. Whatever the reason, if your gait
is off kilter, you limp.

You can have a limp (the noun), or you can limp (the verb), and both
mean that for some reason your legs don’t work quite in synch. Limp
can also be an adjective that means "not strong or firm," like your
friends' limp response to your invitation to come help paint your
house or when your hair looks limp, meaning it's just hanging, with no
volume or style.

In a typical case, the stroke will leave the patient’s left arm
paralyzed, but—here’s the weird part—the patient will completely deny
that anything is wrong with his arm, and will manufacture all sorts of
strange (counterfeit) excuses for why it’s just sitting there, limp
and lifeless.

* neither :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:48]

When offered a choice between two things you don't like, you might
choose neither.  Whereas "either" means you would pick one, neither
closes the door on both, saying you do "not" choose "either" one.

The adjective neither comes directly from Middle English, evolving
from the word nawther. Neither is versatile, and can be used as a
pronoun, ("Neither of your ideas works"), or an adjective ("Neither
plan can be used"). It can also be used as a conjunction, in which
case it is usually paired with "nor" ("We can use neither your first
suggestion nor your second one").  Sounds like you're having a tough
day.

Rationalization, sometimes known to neuroscientists as confabulation,
is the production of fabricated stories made up without any conscious
intention to deceive. They’re not lies, exactly, but neither are they
the honest truth.
* privy :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:49]

If you're privy to something, you've been let in on a secret or know
about something that most people don't. Not many people are privy to
what those top secret documents are all about, for example.

The adjective privy comes from the Latin privatus, meaning “private,”
and describes someone who has knowledge of secret or confidential
information. But watch out: If you use privy as a noun, it can mean
“outhouse” or “toilet,” which actually might be a good place to hide
your diary if you don't want anyone else to be privy to its contents.

The right hemisphere alone had seen the snowy field, and it was the

left hemisphere, meanwhile, had been left completely out of the loop,
but was being asked to justify a decision it took no part in and
wasn’t privy to.
* upshot :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:49]

The upshot of an action is the end result, whatever happens last as a
consequence of the original action.  The upshot of reading this
sentence is that you will understand what the word upshot means.

In the 16th century, the last arrow launched in an archery competition
was called the upshot.  Like that final arrow, the upshot is the
conclusion, the outcome.  Sure, you can eat ice cream really fast, but
the upshot is that you’ll have a brain freeze.  The upshot of eating
ice cream slowly is that it will melt.  Decisions, decisions.

This is also true for signals from the ears—the left hemisphere
processes sound from the right ear, and vice versa. With the eyes it’s
a bit more complicated, but the upshot is that when a patient is
looking straight ahead, everything to the right—in the right half of
the visual field—is processed by the left hemisphere, and everything
to the left is processed by the right hemisphere.

* bask :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:49]

To bask in something is to take it in, receive its warmth, or bathe in
its goodness. On the first warm day of the spring, you may bask in the
sunshine. When you win the Pulitzer, you bask in your own glory.

In Shakespeare’s “As You Like It,” Jaques says: “...As I do live by
food, I met a fool; Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,; And
rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms...” That was most likely the
first time bask was used in the way that we most often use it now: to
bask is to warm yourself, either literally or figuratively, in the
glow of the sun, good fortune, happiness, or a job well done.

“This information is good for us! Let’s keep it prominent, front and
center.” Dwell on it, bask in its warm glow. Reward those neural
pathways in the hope of resurfacing those proud memories whenever
they’re relevant.
* blatant :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:50]

Something blatant is very obvious and offensive. Don't get caught in a
blatant lie, because you won't be able to weasel your way out of it.

Blatant acts are done without trying to hide them. This adjective is
probably from Latin blaterare "to chatter, croak" or Latin blatīre "to
chatter, gossip." A near synonym is flagrant.

It differs from the most blatant forms of self-deception, in which we
actively lie to ourselves (and believe our own lies). It also differs
from strategic ignorance, in which we try our best not to learn
potentially dangerous information.
* prominence :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:50]

Prominence has to do with importance. If a band becomes famous,
they've come into prominence.

Prominence is a type of importance: if you put a statue in the middle
of a room, you're giving it a place of prominence. In movies, music,
and sports, the most successful people have great prominence — they're
prominent or famous. Anything that juts out or sticks out has
prominence. Whether prominence comes from being widely known or just
being hard to miss, you can't really ignore anything or anybody that
has achieved prominence.

Self-discretion is perhaps the most important and subtle mind game
that we play with ourselves in the service of manipulating
others. This is our mental habit of giving less psychological
prominence to potentially damaging information.
* unequivocally :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:51]

Ideas that are presented unequivocally are given clearly, without
causing doubt and confusion.  At your lecture, you presented facts and
charts, speaking unequivocally about the dangers of global warming.

The adverb unequivocally strengthens the ideas in a statement as true
and easy to understand. The word can be traced to the Latin
aequivocus, meaning "ambiguous." The addition of the prefix "un" turns
the meaning around to "not equivocally."  Economist John Kenneth
Galbraith once said, "All of the great leaders have had one
characteristic in common: it was the willingness to confront
unequivocally the major anxiety of their people in their time."

None of these schemes is unequivocally better or more accurate than
the others. They’re just different ways of slicing up the same complex
system—the reality of which is even more fragmented than the
“committee” metaphor suggests.
* distressing :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:51]

Something that's distressing makes you feel sad, upset, or worried. A
distressing phone call from your dad might involve him telling you
your grandma is in the hospital.

When something causes distress, "anxiety, sorrow, or pain," you can
describe it as distressing. Both words come from the Vulgar Latin
districtia, "restraint, affliction, or narrowness," from distringere,
"draw apart or hinder" in Latin. Distressing headlines in the
newspaper convey terrible news, and distressing text messages from
your friend might make you worry for her safety.

When we deceive ourselves about personal health, whether by avoiding
information entirely or by distorting information we’ve already
received, it feels like we’re trying to protect ourselves from
distressing information.
* litmus :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:51]

Litmus is a special dye that's used to determine how acidic a
substance is. Scientists use litmus to test liquids or gases to see if
they're an acid or a base.

Litmus is the mix of dyes that's used to make litmus paper, a
scientific tool that makes it easy to see if a material has an acidic
pH. Made from lichen, litmus can be absorbed onto paper which turns
blue to indicate an alkaline substance and red if it's acidic. Litmus
comes from the Middle Dutch word lijkmoes, which combines lac, "red
resinous substance" and moes, "pulp."

Zhao Gao’s ploy wouldn’t have worked if he had called the deer a
deer. The truth is a poor litmus test of loyalty.
* steadfast :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:52]

Someone who is firm and determined in a belief or a position can be
called steadfast in that view, like your mom when she thinks you
really shouldn’t wear that outfit.

The word steadfast traces back to the Old English word stedefæst, a
combination of stede, meaning "place," and fæst, meaning "firmly
fixed." Picture a steadfast person standing firmly in place, not
wavering or budging an inch, and you’ll have a good sense of what this
word means. Someone can be steadfast in a belief, an effort, a plan,
or even a refusal. Whatever it is, it means that the person will
calmly hold firm to the chosen position and follow through with
determination.

When a group’s fundamental tenets are at stake, those who demonstrate
the most steadfast commitment—who continue to chant the loudest or
clench their eyes the tightest in the face of conflicting

[2021-05-17 Mon 17:52]

A tenet is a principle or belief honored by a person or, more often, a
group of people. "Seek pleasure and avoid pain" is a basic tenet of
Hedonism. "God exists" is a tenet of most major religions.

Tenet is pronounced "ten’it." The word evolved from the Latin tenere
"to hold." The noun tenet is an opinion or doctrine one holds. It
usually refers to a philosophy or a religion, but it doesn't have to —
for instance, Eastern medicine has different tenets from Western
medicine. One of the central tenets of succeeding in the workplace is
that a good offense is the best defense.

When a group’s fundamental tenets are at stake, those who demonstrate
the most steadfast commitment—who continue to chant the loudest or
clench their eyes the tightest in the face of conflicting
evidence—earn the most trust from their fellow group members.
* regurgitate :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:52]

To regurgitate is to bring already swallowed food back up through
one's throat and out the mouth. Not so nice in humans, but much more
understandable (if still gross) in birds — who feed their baby chicks
by regurgitating.

Finished cramming for your exam? Ready to do a data dump? Then you're
about to regurgitate all you've learned — repeat information verbatim
without any real understanding or analysis of it. Don't worry,
everyone does it, from high school and college students, to grown-ups
in corporate boardrooms.

Psychologically, then, politicians don’t so much “lie” as regurgitate
their own self-deceptions. Both are ways of misleading others, but
self-deceptions are a lot harder to catch and prosecute.
* falsehood                                                        :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:53]

A falsehood is a lie. If your mom has an uncanny knack for knowing
when you're telling a falsehood, it means she always knows when you're
stretching the truth.

The noun falsehood is a slightly fancy or old-fashioned way of saying
"lie." It's hard to ever completely trust a friend again once he's
told you a falsehood, although sometimes people tell small falsehoods
simply to make others feel better. Telling your aunt her pink hair
looks fine is a small falsehood, while lying about your grades on a
college application is a pretty big falsehood. The Latin root is
falsus, "deceived or erroneous."

Those who refuse to play such mind games will be at a game-theoretic
disadvantage relative to others who play along. Thus we are often wise
to ignore seemingly critical information and to believe easily refuted
falsehoods—and then to prominently advertise our distorted
thinking—because these are winning moves.
* perverse :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:53]

Something that's perverse is deviant — it's not completely acceptable,
and it may be even a little strange. Your perverse sense of humor
probably makes some of your friends laugh while others just look
uncomfortable.

Something perverse is unusual, possibly somewhat weird, and even
immoral, like that time the odd kid in class announced that a love
poem was really all about lovingly poisoning squirrels and no one sat
next to him for a week afterwards. That kid's perspective was
perverse. Perverse can also mean "stubbornly contradictory" or
"perverted." The word originally meant "wicked," from the Latin
perversus, "turned away or askew," and figuratively, "turned away from
what is right."

The reason this is counterintuitive is because it’s not typically a
good idea to limit our own options. But Schelling documented how the
perverse incentives of mixed-motive games lead to option-limiting and
other actions that seem irrational, but are actually strategic.
* sloppy :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:53]

Sloppy means "untidy" or "messy." If your bedroom has clothes all over
the floor, it's sloppy. And, if you end up with food all over your
shirt every time you eat something, you're sloppy.

Besides "out of order" or "not clean," sloppy can also mean "careless"
or "overemotional." So you might do a sloppy job on an important paper
for school. Or you might go to a sad movie and cry while you watch it,
even though you know it's sloppy and sentimental. The original 18th
century meaning of this adjective was simply "muddy." And before it
meant "ground beef sandwich on a bun," a sloppy joe was a "loose,
messy sweater."

In contrast, using self-deception to preserve self-esteem or reduce
anxiety is a sloppy hack and ultimately self-defeating.
* dissuade :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:54]

When you dissuade someone, you convince that person not to do
something: “When Caroline saw Peter's broken leg, she tried to
dissuade him from going on the ski trip.”

Remember the meaning of dissuade by comparing it to its more common
relative persuade. The suade part that both words share has origins in
the Latin root suadēre, meaning “to urge.” In the case of persuade,
the prefix per- means “thoroughly,” intensifying “to urge” and giving
persuade its meaning of “to convince.” Think of dissuade as the
opposite of persuade: the prefix dis- reverses the action of the root,
giving the meaning of not urging, in other words, convincing someone
NOT to do something.

Possums, lizards, birds, and sharks “play dead,” hoping to dissuade
predators who are interested only in live prey.
* discretion :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:54]

If you have the freedom to decide something on your own, the decision
is left to your discretion. You're in charge.

Discretion traces back to the Latin verb discernere, "to separate, to
discern," from the prefix dis-, "off, away," plus cernere, "separate,
sift." If you use discretion, you sift away what is not desirable,
keeping only the good. If you have the freedom to choose, something is
"at your discretion." Watch out when you hear the phrase "viewer
discretion advised" on TV or at the movies — you will most likely
encounter profanity and violence.

We show similar discretion when we play small-scale politics,
maneuvering for personal advantage in settings like church, the
office, or our peer groups.
* conspicuous :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:55]

Keep your eye on the adjective conspicuous for something that stands
out so much you notice it right away — like that zit in the center of
your friend's forehead.

Conspicuous comes from the adjectival form of the Latin verb,
conspicere, meaning "to look at." Conspicuous can mean either very
obvious to the eye (like something that is conspicuous from a
distance) or attracting attention (like conspicuous consumption). If
you are doing something wrong, it's wise not to be conspicuous about
it!

A police officer who turns a blind eye to conspicuous public drinking
is open to a lot more criticism, from everyone involved, than an
officer who ignores discreet public drinking.
* dupe                                                             :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:57]

A dupe is a furry, ceremonial hat worn during ancient pagan
rituals...or not. Dupe actually means “trick or deceive.” We’re sorry
we tried to dupe you into believing the wrong definition.

Dupe can also refer to the victim of a trick or hoax, and — used in
this sense — it sometimes conveys the idea that the victim is easily
fooled. Dupe comes from the French word for a type of bird called the
hoopoe, which has an extravagant crest and a reputation for being
dim-witted. (And no, that's not another attempt to dupe you; it's the
truth!)

Finally, during a procession through town, a small child blurts out
the truth: “The emperor is naked!” And suddenly the spell is
broken. Everyone decides that if an innocent child can’t see the
clothes, then there is nothing to see. They’ve all been duped.
* blurt                                                            :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:57]

If you blurt something out, you're speaking abruptly and without
thinking about what you're saying.

Usually, when you blurt something, you end up regretting it. Saying
something without considering your words can end up making you feel
stupid or hurting someone's feelings — just imagine what might happen
if you were to blurt out what you really think about your
grandmother's cooking. The best thing about the word blurt is that
it's onomatopoeic, or a word that sounds exactly like what it means.

Finally, during a procession through town, a small child blurts out
the truth: “The emperor is naked!” And suddenly the spell is broken.
* skirt :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:57]

Unlike pants, which fully cover each of your legs separately, a skirt
is basically a single piece of fabric covering part of your legs. If
you want to show a little leg, wear a skirt!

Skirts can be very short (like a miniskirt) or so long they drag on
the ground. Long ago, skirt was also rude slang for a young woman. As
a verb, skirt means "go around," like when you skirt a city instead of
driving straight through it. The word outskirts, "outer parts or
fringes" is related.

We need to stay focused on how people break and skirt the rules, not
whether their behavior is good or bad or whether the rules are just or
unjust.
* cite :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:58]

To cite something means to do right by whoever said it and give them
credit — for instance, if you add a brilliant statement to a paper but
you’re not the one who originally wrote it, you should cite, or point
to, the original author.

Using cite with the meaning "to reference" or "to note" is just one of
several similar uses. A military or other official report can cite
someone for an outstanding act of service, and a legal representative
can cite individuals, or summon them, to show up in court. To cite a
source when writing or verbally repeating something first spoken by
someone else is to give a "citation" or "notation" that gives credit
where credit is due.

If the police want to cite you for public drinking, they can just
waltz over, catch the smell of alcohol on your breath, and arrest you
or issue a citation.
* furtive :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:58]

If you're looking for a formal adjective to describe something sly or
secret, sneak in furtive. Let's hope the teacher doesn't see your
furtive attempts to pass notes in class!

The adjective, furtive, is related to fūrtum, the Latin word for theft
or robbery. This is apparent as the expressions "to give someone a
furtive glance" and "to steal a glance at someone" mean the same
thing. If a person's manner is furtive, he or she is acting
suspiciously. Secret, stealthy and sly are all similar in meaning, but
they lack this image of a thief's actions.

The professor has a strong interest in keeping things fair, so in
order to get away with cheating, you need to be as discreet and
furtive as possible.
* TODO pit                                                         :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:59]

But of course, if our ancestors needed to evolve brains that were good
at cheater-detection, it’s because their peers were routinely trying
to cheat them—and those peers were also our ancestors. Thus early
humans (and protohumans) were locked in an evolutionary arms race,
pitting the skills of some at cheating against the skills of others at
detecting cheating.
* TODO incur                                                       :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:59]

Why do we cheat? It’s simple: cheating lets us reap benefits without
incurring the typical costs. “Nearly 100% of elite competitive
swimmers pee in the pool,” says Carly Geehr, a member of the
U.S. National Swim Team.
* fudge :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:59]

Fudge is a rich, chocolate candy made with plenty of sugar, cream, and
butter. Fudge is usually cut into squares and eaten in small
quantities.

While fudge comes in many different flavors, it's usually
chocolate. In the US, another kind of fudge is smooth, melted
chocolate that can be poured over the top of ice cream. When fudge is
a verb, it means to avoid straightforwardly answering a question or
addressing a subject: "Just answer my question and don't fudge the
issue!" Fudge is an American word from college slang meaning "a
made-up story."

We lie, jaywalk, take office supplies from work, fudge numbers on our
tax returns, make illegal U-turns, suck up to our bosses, have
extramarital affairs, and use recreational drugs.
* middling :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 17:59]

If something is middling, it isn't terrible and it isn't great — it's
mediocre. You might describe your chances of beating your dad at
tennis as middling.

You'll frequently find this adjective in the phrase "fair to
middling," or sometimes "good to middling." This American
colloquialism has been used since the early 17th century to mean
"slightly above average," and it originally referred to the quality of
farm goods. Today you can use it to rate or grade anything, so you
might say, "I thought this peach would be juicy and perfectly ripe,
but it's fair to middling."

Most of us honor the big, important rules, like those prohibiting robbery,
arson, rape, and murder. But we routinely violate small and middling norms.
* arson :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 18:00]

If you deliberately light logs on fire to roast marshmallows, you have
camping skills. If you deliberately set your whole house on fire to
collect the insurance money, you've committed arson.

The noun arson comes from the Latin word ardere, meaning "to burn."
Arson is the act of setting something on fire for a nefarious purpose,
and it is, of course, illegal. If you live in a wildfire risk area,
you know that sometimes wildfires are caused by natural causes like
lightening, sometimes they're caused accidentally by carelessness, and
sadly they're sometimes caused by a deliberate act of arson.

Most of us honor the big, important rules, like those prohibiting robbery,
arson, rape, and murder. But we routinely violate small and middling norms.
* linchpin :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 18:00]

Literally, a linchpin is the pin that goes through the axle of a wheel
to keep it in place, but linchpin can be used to mean an important
part of anything, the thing that holds it all together.

The linchpin is something that supports and holds another thing
together. It’s the most important part of anything — eating well is
the linchpin to staying healthy. A basketball team's most valuable
player is the linchpin. The most crucial part of a plan is the
linchpin. If something or someone is indispensable, she’s the
linchpin. Take away the linchpin and everything falls apart.

Perhaps the most comprehensive norm of all—a catch-all that includes
bragging, currying favor, and political behavior, but extends to everything
else that we’re supposed to do for prosocial reasons—is the norm against
selfish motives. It’s also the linchpin of our thesis. Consider how awkward
it is to answer certain questions by appealing to selfish motives. Why did
you break up with your girlfriend? “I’m hoping to find someone better.” Why
do you want to be a doctor? “It’s a prestigious job with great pay.” Why do
you draw cartoons for the school paper? “I want people to like me.”
* endorse :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 18:01]

To endorse is to give support to someone or something. "I endorse
this!" means "I think this is a good thing, and so should you."

People endorse in many ways. When someone endorses a politician, it
means "You should vote for this person, and I'm putting my reputation
on the line to say so." When someone endorses a product in a
commercial, it means "Go buy this! You'll like it." To endorse is to
give support. You can also endorse a check, which means writing your
name or someone else's on the back so that you or the other person can
cash or deposit it.

But there are acceptable and unacceptable ways to do this. It’s perfectly
acceptable just to “be yourself,” for example. If you’re naturally impressive
or likable, then it seems right and proper for others to like and respect you
as well. What’s not acceptable is sycophancy: brown-nosing, bootlicking,
groveling, toadying, and sucking up. Nor is it acceptable to “buy”
high-status associates via cash, flattery, or sexual favors. These tactics
are frowned on or otherwise considered illegitimate, in part because they
ruin the association signal for everyone else. We prefer celebrities to
endorse products because they actually like those products, not because they
just want cash. We think bosses should promote workers who do a good job, not
workers who just sleep with the boss.

* frowned :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 18:01]

If you frown at someone, you look at them with disapproval, and if you
frown on something they do, you don't approve of that either. Because
you frown on smoking, you probably frown at smokers too!

The distant ancestors of frown, the ones that came long before Old
French, meant "nose." Think about the expression, to look down one's
nose at someone or something, which means "to disapprove of." If you
have a frown on your face, you definitely don't like what you see!
Sometimes when you're thinking hard about something, you might frown,
but that is probably more of an expression of concentration than
disapproval.

But note that there remains a strong incentive to brag and show off. We need
people to notice our good qualities, skills, and achievements; how else will
they know to choose us as friends, mates, and teammates? We want people to
notice our charitable contributions, our political connectedness, and our
prowess in art, sport, and school. If it weren’t verboten, we’d post to
Facebook every time we donated to charity, got a raise at work, or made
friends with an important person. But because bragging is frowned upon, we
have to be a little more discreet—a topic we’ll explore in the next chapter.
* verboten :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 18:02]

Something verboten is forbidden. It isn't allowed or permitted.

If this word looks and sounds odd, that's because it comes straight to
English from German. The concept is simple: anything verboten is
forbidden to do or say. Lying in court is verboten. Wearing a hat in
church is verboten. Many swear words are verboten to say on TV (or at
the dinner table). A verboten act could be illegal or just something
frowned upon, like a taboo. Different cultures believe different
things are verboten.

people to notice our good qualities, skills, and achievements; how else will

* prowess :Elephant:
[2021-05-17 Mon 18:02]

Prowess means exceptional skill or ability. Your sailing prowess might
save your life in a storm, while someone with less experience might
make mistakes.

An earlier meaning of this word is exceptional bravery in battle, or a
specific act of bravery. Prowess is a Middle English word borrowed
from the Old French proesse, "courage, brave deed," from prud, "good,
capable, brave." The related English word proud originally had the now
obsolete meaning of "brave."

But note that there remains a strong incentive to brag and show off. We need

* predispositions :Elephant:
[2021-05-19 Wed 17:10]

A predisposition is a tendency to do something. If you know you have a
predisposition toward getting carsick, better to plan ahead and avoid
eating before a long drive.  Things could get ugly.

Predisposition comes from the Latin prae meaning "before," and
disponere meaning "put in order, arrange, distribute." If you have a
predisposition to think or act a certain way, you can anticipate your
reaction before it happens.  A genetic predisposition means you are
likely to inherit a trait from your parents. Someone might have a
genetic predisposition to diabetes or to another illness.

Together, these instincts and predispositions make up the elephant in the
brain. They’re the facts about ourselves, our behaviors, and our minds that
we’re uncomfortable acknowledging and confronting directly. It’s not that
we’re entirely or irredeemably selfish and self-deceived—just that we’re
often rewarded for acting on selfish impulses, but less so for acknowledging
them, and that our brains respond predictably to those incentives.
* dutifully :Elephant:

* tenuous :Elephant:
[2021-05-19 Wed 17:20]

If something is tenuous it's thin, either literally or
metaphorically. If you try to learn a complicated mathematical concept
by cramming for 45 minutes, you will have a tenuous grasp of that
concept, at best.

Tenuous comes from the Latin word tenuis, for thin, and is related to
our word tender. Something can be physically tenuous, like a spiderweb
or ice on a pond. We more often use it in a metaphorical sense, to
talk about weak ideas. Tenuous arguments won't win any debate
tournaments. Synonyms for tenuous, also used physically or
metaphorically, are flimsy and shaky.

Well, what Gazzaniga concludes from his years of research, including later
work on healthy patients, is that all human brains contain a system he calls
the “interpreter module.”9 The job of this module is to interpret or make
sense of our experiences by constructing explanations: stories that integrate
information about the past and present, and about oneself and the outside
world. This interpreter works to the best of its abilities given the
information available to it. So in whole-brained patients, when information
is flowing freely between the two hemispheres, the explanations produced by
the interpreter typically make a lot of sense. But when the information flow
breaks down, whether because of brain damage or any other reason, the
interpreter is forced to weave more tenuous, inventive explanations, or even
whole-cloth fabrications.
* appease :Elephant:
[2021-05-19 Wed 17:28]

Appease means to make or preserve peace with a nation, group, or
person by giving in to their demands, or to relieve a problem, as in
"the cold drink appeased his thirst."

Appease often implies abandoning your moral principles to satisfy the
demands of someone who is greedy for power: think of British Prime
Minister Chamberlain's attempt to appease the Nazis at Munich. The
verb appease comes from the Old French apaisier, "to pacify, make
peace, or be reconciled," from the phrase "a paisier," which combines
a-, or "to," and pais, "peace," from the Latin pax.

Above all, it’s the job of our brain’s Press Secretary to avoid acknowledging
our darker motives—to tiptoe around the elephant in the brain. Just as a
president’s press secretary should never acknowledge that the president is
pursuing a policy in order to get reelected or to appease his financial
backers, our brain’s Press Secretary will be reluctant to admit that we’re
doing things for purely personal gain, especially when that gain may come at
the expense of others. To the extent that we have such motives, the Press
Secretary would be wise to remain strategically ignorant of them.
* judicious :Elephant:
[2021-05-19 Wed 17:31]

If you're judicious, you've got a good head on your shoulders and make
good decisions. Humpty Dumpty's decision to sit on a wall? NOT
judicious.

As its sound implies, judicious comes from the same Latin word from
which we get judge and judiciary, and not surprisingly a judicious
decision is one that only comes after all sides have been weighed up
and opposing points of view taken into consideration. Judicious
decisions are never split-second decisions.

This realization flies in the face of common sense. In everyday life, there’s
a strong bias toward treating the self as the mind’s ultimate
decision-maker—the iron-fisted monarch, or what Dennett calls the mind’s Boss
or Central Executive.12 As Harry Truman said about his presidency, “The buck
stops here”—and we often imagine the same is true of the self. But the
conclusion from the past 40 years of social psychology is that the self acts
less like an autocrat and more like a press secretary. In many ways, its
job—our job—isn’t to make decisions, but simply to defend them. “You are not
the king of your brain,” says Steven Kaas. “You are the creepy guy standing
next to the king going, ‘A most judicious choice, sire.’ “

* versatile :GoLang:
[2021-05-20 Thu 11:39]

To describe a person or thing that can adapt to do many things or
serve many functions, consider the adjective versatile.

In E.B. White's classic children's book Charlotte's Web, Charlotte the
spider tells Wilbur the pig that she is versatile. "What does
'versatile' mean — full of eggs?" Wilbur asks. "Certainly not,"
Charlotte replies. "'Versatile' means I can turn with ease from one
thing to another." Charlotte knew her etymology, because the word
reflects its Latin root, versatilis, "turning around; revolving." It
eventually came to describe someone who is multi-talented: a
singer-songwriter-actress-model would be a versatile figure in the
entertainment world.

While Go is a versatile programming language that can be used for many
different programming projects, it’s particularly well suited for
networking/distributed systems programs, and has earned a reputation as “the
language of the cloud”. It focuses on helping the modern programmer do more
with a strong set of tooling, removing debates over formatting by making the
format part of the language specification, as well as making deployment easy
by compiling to a single binary. Go is easy to learn, with a very small set
of keywords, which makes it a great choice for beginners and experienced
developers alike.
