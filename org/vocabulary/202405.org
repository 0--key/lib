Circuitous means indirect or roundabout. If you're already late for
school, you'll want to take the straightest, fastest way there, not a
circuitous one!

Something that's contested is argued over or questioned. Contested
election results may need to be re-counted, since the two sides can't
agree on their validity.

To cut an extremely long story short what I came to real. And this is
not contested by any NE neurologist I know of anywhere in the world is
that the difference is one of attention, - so after a right hemisphere
stroke patients are often said to have a pathological narrowing of the
window of attention, but more than that they have a particular use of
that attention which is to get things so they're intent on getting
things controlling things.
