* engulf :satellite:
[2018-08-14 Tue 08:18]

Engulf is a verb that means being completely surrounded, soaked, or
covered. Fire, snow, smoke, flood waters, or even violence are a few
things that could engulf you.

Suppose an amusement park had a ride called Into the Whirlpool. Sounds
like one for thrill-seekers who aren't afraid of water. Riders should
expect to get lost inside, fully absorbed by the experience. The word
engulf comes from the Old French word golfe, meaning "whirlpool," and
the prefix en-, meaning "in or into." Riders of Into the Whirlpool
should expect to feel engulfed — surrounded by water and completely
covered.

Their struggle for dominance threatens to engulf the galaxy.

* pluck :satellite:
[2018-08-14 Tue 09:15]

To pluck is to pick or pull a single item out of many, like a flower
or a hair. As a noun, pluck is energy or enthusiasm, even when things
are looking grim.

Don't pluck only the best cherries off the tree: that's
cherry-picking! Before you cook a goose, you need to pluck its
feathers. If it looks like your goose is cooked, however, then show
some pluck, and figure out a way to save yourself. Some characters who
are famous for showing pluck include the Artful Dodger, Little Orphan
Annie, and Benji the dog. They all kept their chins up and kept on
trying, even when things looked really dark.

* canny :satellite:
[2018-08-16 Thu 10:53]

If you're a canny investor, you know how to spend money to make money
— that is, you're prudent, farsighted, and capable of protecting your
own interests, particularly in matters of finance or business.

In contemporary usage, canny is a synonym for shrewd. Both words mean
smart or sharp-witted, but they also suggest that someone is smart in
a self-serving and possibly even tricky way. Canny is also related to
the word cunning — another adjective meaning wise, but with negative
connotations. Uncanny is not the opposite of canny — it means weird or
unsettling.

The current meaning of English canny is "careful
  and clever, especially in handling money."
* lass :satellite:
[2018-08-16 Thu 10:56]

A lass is a girl. Your Scottish folk dance teacher might announce,
"Lads line up on that side, lasses on this side!"

Lass is an old-fashioned way to say "young girl," and it's more common
in parts of Britain than in the US. You're most likely to hear this
word in Scotland and the north of England, although lass is most
likely rooted in Scandinavian languages, like the Old Swedish løsk
kona, "unmarried woman," or the Old Norse löskr, "idle or weak."

"she's a canny lass"
* disguise                                                        :satellite:
[2018-08-16 Thu 11:03]

A disguise is something you put on so no one recognizes you. It also
can be used as a verb. You can disguise yourself with a wig and
mustache; that's a great disguise.

Disguise can be used anytime you're talking about concealing or hiding
something. Most of the time we think of a disguise as something you
wear, but you can also disguise your feelings. Criminals might
disguise their intentions. You can also use the word to describe
something that seems to be one thing, but turns out to be another. You
missed the plane, but then the plane crashed. That's a blessing in
disguise.

Disguise involves hiding your real identity,
  disappearing in the new role.
* prowess :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 11:39]

Prowess means exceptional skill or ability. Your sailing prowess might
save your life in a storm, while someone with less experience might
make mistakes.

An earlier meaning of this word is exceptional bravery in battle, or a
specific act of bravery. Prowess is from Middle English, from Old
French proece, proesse, from prou, prud "good, capable, brave." The
related English word proud has the now obsolete meaning of brave.

prowess, and he insisted on designing the
new floor himself.
* amiss :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 11:41]

When things are out of their proper places or not happening the way
they should, we say they are amiss. And remember, amiss is as good as
a mile.

The word amiss can be used as an adverb, as in the sentence, "I spoke
amiss." Or you could use it as an adjective, as when you think
something is wrong or missing — "Something in the room is amiss."
Either way, amiss refers to something that is wrong, off the mark, or
"missed" (note the connection). Once in a while, the word amiss can
imply that something fishy or foul has taken place. In Hamlet, when
Marcellus said, "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark," he
might as well have said, "Something in Denmark is amiss."

anything amiss, until a late arrival at
the celebration wanted to look round the new rooms.
* tassel                                                            :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 11:45]

A tassel is an ornament or decoration that's made of threads. Tassels
are used to decorate curtains, pillows, and clothing.

A graduation cap (or mortarboard) often has a cord with a tassel
attached to the top with a cord—in the U.S. it's traditional for a
student to move the tassel from one side to the other at the end of
the graduation ceremony. You'll also see tassels along the edges of
fancy drapery and other soft furnishings. Tassels in various parts of
the ancient Arab world were considered good luck, said to protect
children from evil spirits.

In the fields the maize
was starting to fill out, the silken tassels turning from brown to butter-blond; when
you tore off the wrapping of leaves and bit into the rows of pearly seeds the juice
would spurt into your mouth like milk.
* conceivable :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 11:56]

If you see yellowish skies on a humid, spring evening in Kansas, it is
entirely conceivable that a tornado is in the making. That is to say,
it's imaginable or even possible, so make sure you take every
conceivable precaution.

If you conceive of something, you imagine or think of it. So, it makes
sense that the adjective conceivable describes things that can be
imagined or thought of. People often use the word conceivable in
extreme contexts. If you look everywhere for your homework but still
can't find it, you might declare, "I searched in every conceivable
location! My homework must have disappeared." In response, your
teacher might remark that disappearing homework is inconceivable, or
"impossible to imagine."

So every
morning I spent a happy hour or so adding another chapter to my epic, a stirring tale
which involved a voyage round the world with the family, during which we captured every
conceivable kind of fauna in the most unlikely traps.
* fraught :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 16:16]

Fraught means filled with something — often something bad. Your
Thanksgiving was fraught with awkward moments when your family saw
your blue hair, and it only got worse when you told them you'd quit
law school to join the circus.

Fraught is related to the word freight, and comes from the Middle
English fraughten, meaning "to load with cargo." Think of a cargo ship
loaded up with freight for a journey — it's full of supplies, just
like Thanksgiving was filled with — or fraught with — awkward moments.
Fraught can also describe a situation filled with distress. If
relations between two countries are fraught, they are not getting
along with each other.

Sometimes these
climaxes were so complicated and fraught with danger that I had great difficulty in
extricating the family intact on the following day.
* specimen :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 16:31]

A specimen is a sample of something, like a specimen of blood or body
tissue that is taken for medical testing.

The noun specimen comes from the Latin word specere, meaning “to
look.” Biologists collect specimens so they can get a better look at
something to study it. The idea is that, with a good specimen, you can
learn about an entire group: it's a good representation. That meaning
is echoed in the slang use of specimen, a strong, healthy and
attractive person.

Peter explained that I had not
cured it properly, and said that if I could obtain another specimen he would show me the
correct procedure.
* opposed :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 16:46]

When things are opposed, they're against each other. Two teams playing
against each other are opposed; so are two sides in a war.

If you're opposed, you're usually up against an opponent or opposing
side. Politicians often talk about being opposed to one law and in
favor of another. If someone is against higher taxes, they're opposed
to higher taxes. Someone on the other side is opposed to lower taxes.
But you could also simply be opposed to something like breakfast
before 10 am.

As he was now far too old to be kept in a
basket, and strongly opposed to the idea of a cage, I was forced to give him the run of
the study.
* nonchalance :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 16:47]

Nonchalance is a casual lack of concern, a relaxed state without
anxiety or enthusiasm. Like how you'd act if the girl you've had a
secret crush on since grade school asks you to the prom. (Or maybe
not.)

It's hard to achieve nonchalance. If you're like most people, there's
always going to be something that will rattle you. And you can forget
about behaving with chalance, because chalance isn't a word. Sometimes
you hear people say that so-and-so acted with "studied nonchalance,"
which means to sort of fake it. Oddly, the word's origins go back to
the Latin calere, which is the same word as the root of calorie. A
calorie is a unit of energy, and to act with nonchalance is to refrain
from showing too much energy or excitement, so actually, it makes
sense.

With great nonchalance he would regurgitate a pellet of undigested food
on to the newspaper spread below for this, and other, purposes.
* trim :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 16:48]

When you cut something, literally or figuratively, you trim it. If you
have steady hands, you can trim your own bangs. If you don't have
steady hands, you can save up for a professional haircut by trimming
the amount of money you spend on comics and snacks.

A landscaper trims the grass and shrubs, and a cook trims fat off of
meat before cooking it. But when you trim the Christmas tree, you
decorate it, and when a sailor trims the sails, she adjusts them so
they'll catch the wind just right. And as a noun, a trim is "an act of
cutting," while trim is "decoration." All forms of this word are
rooted in nautical language.

to make sure his voice was in trim, and then launch himself on soft wings, to drift
round the room as silently as a flake of ash and land on my shoulder.
* mince :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 16:59]

To mince is to chop into tiny bits. Your favorite soup recipe might
include directions to mince four cloves of garlic.

When you dice an onion into very small pieces, you mince it, and when
you grind meat very fine to make sausage or mincemeat, you also mince.
Another meaning of the verb is to soften, or to express something in a
gentle way: "She does mince her words when she talks to shy
kindergarteners." The Old French root, mincier, means "make into small
pieces," and it comes from the Latin word for "small," minutus.

If I was not there, he would fly up the side
of the house again to land on my bedroom window-sill and tap briskly on the shutters,
until I opened them and served him with his saucer of mince, or chopped chicken's heart,
or whatever delicacy was on the menu that day.
* gory :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 17:00]

Use the word gory to describe something that features a lot of
bloodshed and violence, like a horror movie in which victims are axed
to death by a madman. Some people love gory movies like that, and
others refuse to watch them.

Something that is gory often involves both violence and bloodshed, but
it can also describe something that is merely blood, like the gory
photographs depicting a root canal procedure in a dental assistant
textbook. Gory can describe unpleasant, embarrassing things, like
saying of your brother’s bad behavior over the holidays, “I’ll spare
you the gory details about his meltdown at the family Christmas
party.”

When the last gory morsel had been
swallowed he would give a soft, hiccoughing chirrup, sit meditating for a moment, and
then fly off over the moon-bright tree-tops.
* morsel :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 17:01]

A morsel is a small amount of something, a tid-bit, a sliver, usually
of something of high-quality and much desired — like a morsel of dark
chocolate or a morsel of secret information.

Originally it referred specifically to food — a nineteenth century
lady might partake of a "dainty morsel" to eat, for example. More
often than not morsel now refers to non-food items: a morsel of good
taste; a morsel of common sense, and, of course, most popular of all,
a morsel of gossip. That's why, like all good food, all good gossip is
juicy.

When the last gory morsel had been
swallowed he would give a soft, hiccoughing chirrup, sit meditating for a moment, and
then fly off over the moon-bright tree-tops.
* indignantly :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 17:02]

If your mother accuses you of stealing her necklace and pawning it,
you'll answer her indignantly that you did no such thing!

Indignantly is the adverb form of the adjective indignant. If you are
indignant about something, you're offended and mad because someone did
something unfair. You might indignantly demand that you are paid
equally to your co-worker who does the same job. If you get an F on a
paper you worked hard on and that you know is good, you might
indignantly demand that your teacher explains the poor grade.

He would ride on Roger's back, clinging tight to the
black wool; if, as occasionally happened, Roger forgot his passenger and went too fast,
or skittishly jumped over a stone, Ulysses's eye would blaze, his wings flap in a
frantic effort to keep his balance, and he would click his beak loudly and indignantly
until I reprimanded Roger for his carelessness.
* gambol                                                            :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 17:03]

To gambol is to run around playing excitedly. Although the word sounds
like "gamble," when you gambol you never lose — you just have a great
time!

If you've ever sprinted around, jumping up and down, yelling
"woo-hoo!," you already know how to gambol. Being really excited or
even just slap-happy makes people gambol, and it's so energizing that
animals do it too. Dogs gambol when they rise on two legs to greet
each other, and squirrels gambol when they chase each other up and
down trees. And when springtime comes after a long winter, it seems to
make every living thing gambol with extra life.

On the shore Ulysses would perch on my
shorts and shirt, while Roger and I gambolled in the warm, shallow water.
* hastily                                                           :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 17:09]

When you do something hastily you rush through it in a hurried manner.
If you write an essay hastily, don't expect an A.

Haste is speed, so if you do something hastily, you're just doing it
too fast. When a job should take time, like building a house, but it's
done hastily, something often goes wrong. If you hastily leave the
dinner table without explaining yourself, people will think you're
rude.

Hastily I righted myself and trod water, looking to see
how far from the beach I had drifted.
* envied :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 17:19]

Wanting what someone else has and resenting them for having it is
envy. If your best friend comes to school with the silver backpack
you’d had your eye on all summer, you want to be happy for her,
instead you feel bitter envy.

Envy comes from the Latin word invidere, which literally means “look
upon.” You know when you say something funny or smart and someone
gives you the evil eye? Envy all the way. Envy can be used as a noun
or as a verb: Envy (noun) is the feeling you have when you envy (verb)
what someone else has.

For some time Mother had greatly envied us our swimming, both in the daytime and at
night, but, as she pointed out when we suggested she join us, she was far too old for
that sort of thing.
* jolly :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 18:03]

Someone who's jolly is extremely cheerful. Your jolly French teacher
might spend a large part of each class laughing out loud at his own
jokes — if only you understood French, you could laugh along with him.

Santa Claus might be the mythical figure best known for being jolly —
he's especially famous for his jolly "Ho ho ho!" Anyone who tends to
be merry or festive is jolly, and when you want to cheer up a
less-than-jolly friend, you can jolly them, teasing or kidding until
they smile. The Old French root is jolif, "festive, merry, or pretty."

'What a jolly idea!
* belligerently :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 19:44]

Mean people are not cool. They go around acting belligerently, or
being hostile and aggressive to others. No one likes a meanie.

The word belligerently comes from the Latin belligerant meaning
"waging war," which is in effect, what someone acting belligerently is
doing. Think of those two l's in the word as two soldiers marching in
formation and you might have some help remembering that belligerently
is spelled with two l's and not one. Often this word is used to
describe the way that some people start to behave when they've had too
much to drink, lashing out belligerently, or being overly aggressive.

and I'm not asking you to wear it,' Mother pointed out belligerently.
* apparition :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 19:58]

If you see something you think might be a ghost, you can call it an
apparition to hedge your bets. Apparition doesn't commit you in the
same way the word ghost does—and saying that you've seen one won't
cause you to be committed.

Deriving from the Latin apparere "appear," apparition was first used
in 1520 in a religious context, referring to the moment when the three
wise men appear before the infant Jesus in the Bible. Later,
apparition came to include the appearance of ghosts, or ghostly
figures. It can also mean a memory so vivid it's like seeing a ghost.

Roger was
the first to enter, and on being greeted by this strange apparition clad in its
voluminous black costume rippling with frills, he retreated hurriedly through the door,
backwards, barking ferociously.
* immersion :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:00]

Immersion is the act of dipping something in a substance, completely
covering it. It might be something physical, such as plunging your
body into water, or metaphorical, such as becoming totally immersed in
a project.

The Latin background of immersion includes the root mergere, "to
plunge." The idea of immersion as a physical submergence came first
and the idea of something being absorbed in a situation came about
later. The idea behind immersion is that of complete coverage, whether
that be by water, as in Baptism, or by attention, as in "immersion
learning," an idea for learning a language trademarked in 1965 by the
Berlitz company.

The day for the great immersion arrived,
food and wine were prepared, the boat was cleaned out and filled with cushions, and
everything was ready when Theodore turned up.
* strenuous :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:02]

Something strenuous requires all your effort and strength, like a hard
workout at the gym or carrying a backpack full of heavy books.

Strenuous can also describe something done with lots of energy or
force. If your boss asks you to do a strenuous task like carry a couch
up a flight of stairs by yourself, and you refuse by jumping up and
down in protest, you have a strenuous objection to her request. To
remember how to spell it, remember that something strenuous requires
the strength of two of you! That's why there are two u's in strenUoUs.

To begin with, her eyes not having become accustomed to the dark, Mother
skilfully steered us in a tight circle, so that after ten minutes' strenuous rowing the
jetty suddenly loomed up and we ran into it with a splintering crash.
* jetty :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:03]

A jetty is a narrow structure that's built to stretch from land out
into the water. Some jetties act as docks or piers for boats.

A man-made jetty is often a protective barrier against beach erosion,
and it also provides pedestrians access to boats or fishing areas.
Jetties are generally made of concrete, wood, or stone. Jetty comes
from the French jetee, which means both "a throw" and "a projecting
part of a structure," or "a part that's 'thrown out' beyond the main
structure."

To begin with, her eyes not having become accustomed to the dark, Mother
skilfully steered us in a tight circle, so that after ten minutes' strenuous rowing the
jetty suddenly loomed up and we ran into it with a splintering crash.
* loom                                                              :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:03]

Loom has two distinct meanings. First, it's a tool for weaving.
Second, it means to appear or stand over someone in a threatening way.
The future loomed grim. The shadow loomed above us.

A common way we hear loom is in "loomed large," as in, "The specter of
getting fired loomed large in Amanda's imagination." Deriving from Low
German or Dutch, the word sounds smoky (or misty) and spectral: the
Antarctic ice-shelf loomed on the horizon as Shackleton's ship
approached the continent.

To begin with, her eyes not having become accustomed to the dark, Mother
skilfully steered us in a tight circle, so that after ten minutes' strenuous rowing the
jetty suddenly loomed up and we ran into it with a splintering crash.
* wade :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:07]

To wade is to walk through water. If you've been fishing without a
boat, you'll have to wade to reach your precious prize (if it gets
away, you can brag about how big it was).

When you wade, it doesn't have to literally be through a liquid;
wading includes any action that involves a laborious slog through
something that offers resistance. For example, you might attempt to
wade through a huge book like Moby Dick. And if you want to get into a
fight? Wade right on into the brawling crowd. Or if it's verbal
fisticuffs you're after, wade right on in to the debate.

Roger behaved very well until he saw
Mother wade into the shallow water in a slow and dignified manner.
* writhed :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:09]

Watch someone burn themselves on a hot pan, struggle to lift heavy
weights, or strain to hoist his leg up over his head and you'll
probably notice his writhed lips — twisted in pain.

Writhed comes from the Old English writhan, meaning "make into coils"
which is much like what you're doing when contorting yourself or
putting yourself in a writhed position. The word writhed is used not
just to describe an action but also to describe the quality of people
or things. So while a snake writhes on the ground, its writhed body
can also lie in a coil in the grass.

We writhed on the sand, helpless with
laughter, while Mother sat gasping in the shallows, making desperate attempts to regain
her feet, beat Roger off, and retain at least a portion of her costume.
* partake                                                           :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:10]

When you partake in something, you join in, like when you partake in
the three-legged race and bobbing for apples at your town fall
festival.

The verb partake is almost always followed by the word in, and used in
a somewhat formal context. You partake in whatever activities you
participate — or take part — in, like when you partake in a backyard
football game or partake in your family's holiday cookie making party.
If you get a share of something, you also partake of it, like when you
partake of the delicious buffet at your cousin's wedding.

Eventually, after we had partaken of a glass of wine to celebrate and recover from
what Larry referred to as Perseus's rescue of Andromeda, we went in to swim, and Mother
sat discreetly in the shallows, while Roger crouched nearby, growling ominously at the
costume as it bulged and fluttered round Mother's waist.
* congregat                                                         :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:13]

Congregate is a verb that means to come together, to assemble, or to
gather. At school dances, you may congregate with your friends,
because you get nervous in front of kids you don't know very well.

Congregate comes from Latin root words com, meaning "together" and
gregare, meaning "to gather in a flock." Congregation, or a gathering
or assembly, comes from the same roots, as does gregarious, an
adjective describing someone who likes to gather with others to
socialize. If you remember the key word is flock — what ministers
often call their congregations — you should have no trouble
remembering congregate means to flock together.

Never had we seen so many fireflies
congregated in one spot; they flicked through the trees in swarms, they crawled on the
grass, the bushes and the olive-trunks, they drifted in swarms over our heads and landed
on the rugs, like green embers.
* ember                                                             :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:13]

An ember is a little piece of wood or coal in a fire that's dying.
Embers are hot and glowing. When the fire is out and the embers are
glowing, it’s time to call it a night.

Embers (usually plural) are smoldering pieces of wood or coal —
usually very small — that burn brightly as a fire starts to fade. When
you see embers, the fire isn’t finished yet, but it’s almost done. If
you’re camping and you put out a fire, don’t leave it alone until the
embers go out, too. People also use embers as a metaphor for other
things that are starting to fade, like the last embers of a dying
friendship.

Never had we seen so many fireflies
congregated in one spot; they flicked through the trees in swarms, they crawled on the
grass, the bushes and the olive-trunks, they drifted in swarms over our heads and landed
on the rugs, like green embers.
* conflagration :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:15]

A conflagration isn't just a few flames; it's an especially large and
destructive fire that causes devastation.

That tiny campfire that somehow turned into a raging forest inferno?
You could call that intense, uncontrolled blaze a conflagration. Mrs.
O'Leary's cow knew a thing or two about conflagrations: It was that
unknowing animal that kicked over a kerosene lamp in the night,
setting the O'Leary's barn on fire and sending four square miles of
the Windy City into that blistering conflagration known as the Great
Chicago Fire of 1871.

In the centre of the bay they swam round, diving and rolling, occasionally
leaping high in the air and falling back into a conflagration of light
* venture :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:28]

A venture is a risky undertaking. If your latest venture is a dog food
store, you hope there are some hungry dogs around. Also, to venture is
to go somewhere possibly dangerous, like if you venture out into a
snowstorm

Venture is a shortened form of adventure. This happened sometime
between 1100 AD and 1400 AD during the time that Middle English was
spoken. While the two words are similar in meaning, when you subtract
the "ad," you lose a teaspoon or two of fun, and add a heaping
tablespoon of risk

The acquisition of this machine opened up a vast area of coastland for us, for
we could now venture much farther afield, making trips along the jagged coastline to
remote and deserted beaches golden as corn, or lying like fallen moons among the
contorted rocks
* contorted                                                         :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:28]

Use the adjective contorted to describe something that's twisted or
misshapen. If your face is contorted with frustration as you build a
model sailboat, you’re furrowing your brows and wrinkling your nose —
and should probably find a new hobby

Things can be physically contorted, like a twisting mountain trail, or
figuratively contorted, like a biased magazine article. A story can
get contorted as well. The more times you tell people the tale of your
bike crash, the more it changes, until in the end you're telling a
pretty contorted version in which the bike is a motorcycle and the
lamp post is a pack of rabid dogs

The acquisition of this machine opened up a vast area of coastland for us, for
we could now venture much farther afield, making trips along the jagged coastline to
remote and deserted beaches golden as corn, or lying like fallen moons among the
contorted rocks
* bewildering :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:31]

To bewilder is to amaze, baffle, dumbfound, flummox, perplex, or
stupefy. When you bewilder people, you confuse them

Bewilder is a fun-sounding word for confusion-causing. A complicated
math problem will bewilder many students. A magician's tricks should
bewilder the audience. Mystery stories should be a little bewildering,
at least until the end. Sometimes, being bewildered has a more
emotional element. If someone you know died in a freak accident, that
would bewilder you in a very sad way

For some reason, which I could not discover, the sea faunae were
greatly attracted by this archipelago, and round the edges of the islands, in
rock-pools and sandy bays the size of a large table, there was a bewildering
assortment of life
* inveigle :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 20:31]

When you tell your boyfriend he’s not just the best boyfriend ever but
also the world's best driver, and this makes him offer to drive the
whole way on your upcoming road trip, then congratulations. You know
how to inveigle, or use charm to coax someone into doing something

If you successfully inveigle your sister to doing something for you,
she must be so caught up in your flattering that she is blind to your
true intention. In fact, inveigle comes from the Middle French word
aveugler, meaning “delude, make blind,” which can be traced back to
the Medieval Latin word ab oculis, or “lacking eyes.” The people you
inveigle don't see what you are really up to

I managed to inveigle the family into several trips to these
islets, but as these had few good bathing spots the family soon got bored with having
to sit on sun-baked rocks while I fished interminably in the pools and unearthed at
intervals strange and, to them, revolting sea-creatures
* limpid :Durrell:
[2018-08-16 Thu 22:03]

The adjective limpid describes something (often liquid) that is clear,
serene and bright. Nature calendars often feature glamour shots of a
limpid stream or a limpid lake

The adjective limpid may also describe language that is easily
understandable. Your teacher might ask you to give an answer in a
single limpid sentence. But he probably won't because limpid is a word
that's fallen out of use. Maybe because it sounds too much like limp
Or maybe because it's associated with the king of all clichés: "Her
eyes were like limpid pools."

Our trips there
became less and less frequent, in spite of all arguments on my part, and I was
tortured by the thought of all the wonderful animal life waiting in the limpid pools
to be caught; but I was unable to do anything about it, simply because I had no boat
* retarded :satellite:
[2018-08-17 Fri 10:18]

Retarded is a word to describe someone who is mentally slow. This is a
medical word that spread to slang, and is today considered very
insulting and inappropriate

Some uses of retarded are harmless, like if you said wearing a
backpack retarded or slowed down your progress on a hike. However, if
you use retarded to mean stupid, you're on dangerous ground. Out of
respect for people who have clinical mental retardation, this is
considered an offensive term to throw around

And human with 2–3 of concious mind, falls in a category of mental
retarded
* quench :satellite:
[2018-08-17 Fri 10:34]

Quench means to put out, put an end to, or satisfy. If you're stranded
in the middle of the desert with nothing to drink, you're probably
dreaming of a nice big glass of ice water to quench your thirst

Quench originally meant “extinguish fires.” That meaning still works
today, but we've expanded it to also apply to quenching the fiery
thirst of a summer marathon runner or quenching the hot flames of
passion. If you want to get deep about the word quench, consider what
Voltaire said: “Superstition sets the whole world in flames;
philosophy quenches them.”

Watch
documentaries to quench your thirst for knowledge
* agility :satellite:
[2018-08-17 Fri 10:35]

Agility is the ability to be quick and graceful. You might have
agility on the basketball court or in the courtroom, or even with your
gaming remote

The noun agility can be used for both mental and physical skills in
speed and grace. Your mental agility might allow you to follow both
conversations at once. Or your brother's soccer prowess shows in his
physical agility. The word agility does not have to be applied to
human abilities, however: "The sailboat's agility in the water made it
the perfect craft for racing."

Any new information will help you train your mental agility in
memorization (how to memorize faster) and recovery
* devour :satellite:
[2018-08-17 Fri 10:36]

When you've gone all day without eating anything, you'll probably
devour your dinner, especially if it's your very favorite homemade
lasagna. Devour means to eat greedily and hungrily

The meaning of devour has grown to include the consumption of things
other than food. If you sit down to start a book and look up ten hours
later having turned the last page, you have devoured that book. If
your after school job devours all your free time, chances are your
grades are going to drop. The Latin root, devorare, means "to swallow
down."

If you want to become smarter, devour books!
* akin :satellite:
[2018-08-17 Fri 16:38]

If two things are akin, then they're similar or related. A cupcake is
akin to a cake and relatives are akin to each other

If you know the word kin — a relative — then you have a clue to the
meaning of akin. People who are related are akin, but the word goes
beyond blood relations. Football is akin to the sport of rugby;
baseball is akin to the British sport cricket. Mice are akin to rats,
and rats are akin to gerbils, hamsters, and squirrels. Things that are
akin are alike

It’s believed to be able to retain up to 2.5 petabytes of information—that’s akin to
nearly three million hours of television
* deterioration :satellite:
[2018-08-17 Fri 16:45]

If something is in a state of deterioration, it's getting worse. A
crumbling old house with a caved-in roof and foot-tall weeds growing
through the deck is going through deterioration

Deterioration implies that things are falling apart: something once in
good condition is now weakened, worn out, or otherwise in decline
Things often undergo deterioration because of neglect. Time also has a
lot to do with deterioration. Museum curators are always worried about
stopping the deterioration of their prized antiquities, like the
ancient Egyptian mummies that should not be exposed to air

To boot,
exercise increases the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a chemical that
aids in the prevention of brain deterioration
* exemption :satellite:
[2018-08-17 Fri 16:58]

When you get an exemption, you don't have to do something. In the
sixties, some people got exemptions from military service during the
Vietnam War

We don't often think of being left out as a good thing, but when you
use the word exemption, you mean that someone has been excluded in a
positive way. Children are exemptions, or deductions, on tax forms;
the more children you have the less taxes you pay. Some non-profits
are tax-exempt; their exemption means they pay no taxes at all
Exemptions also spare people from fighting in wars and doing some
jobs. An exemption gets you off the hook

Sleeping is your body’s way of recuperating itself, and the
brain is no exemption
* indolent :satellite:
[2018-08-17 Fri 21:15]

Indolent is an adjective meaning slow or lazy. It can take an indolent
teenager hours to get out of bed on a weekend morning. Often it's noon
before he finally comes shuffling down to breakfast in his pajamas

An indolent person is slow and lazy — not the type of person you'd
want running your corporation or competing with you in a relay race
Doctors use the word indolent to describe medical conditions that are
slow to progress. If you're diagnosed with an illness, you'd prefer an
indolent one over one that spreads quickly

I became all alone and my mind became indolent to normalcy
* adage :satellite:
[2018-08-17 Fri 21:16]

An adage is a saying. Moms and dads love adages such as "early to bed,
early to rise" and "an apple a day keeps the doctor away."

The noun adage comes from the Latin root, aio, meaning "I say." Like a
proverb, an adage can be true or not so much. It's a folksy saying
that's been passed around for so long that it doesn't even matter if
it's true anymore. Adages can be wise and wisecracking, such as this
quote from Alice Roosevelt Longworth: "I've always believed in the
adage that the secret of eternal youth is arrested development."
There's a Book of Proverbs in the Bible, but adages can show up
anywhere, even cross-stitched on a pillow

What you can conceive in your mind, you will receive is the main adage
* gamut :satellite:
[2018-08-17 Fri 21:19]

A visit with a long-lost cousin might arouse emotions that run the
gamut of joy, regret, sorrow, and excitement. A gamut is a full or
complete range

In the 16th century, the gamut was the lowest note on the musical
scale. In music as well as life, the word has expanded to mean from
high to low, or the whole range. The word is often associated with
"run," as in "run the gamut from totally excited to so terrified
you're quaking with fear." And if you've talked about every discussion
point on your agenda, you've covered the gamut of issues that need
discussing

Environments could run the gamut from arguing a point in class or work, managing a
team to deliver a software product, solve math problems in grad school, or play a
symphony
* swath :satellite:
[2018-08-17 Fri 21:21]

A swath was originally the long narrow space created by a single swing
of a scythe in a field of grass or corn as the cutter moved through
it. Nowadays it is used more figuratively to mean any kind of path
someone makes

The figurative use of swath has nonphysical senses as well, as in the
term "a significant swath of the population believes..." Or if someone
is trying to attract attention to themselves, or is making quite a
public stir, they might be said to be "cutting a swath through the
business world" or "cutting a swath on the dance floor." Hopefully,
neither of the latter involves using scythes

To be effective in such situations requires a broad swath of knowledge and the ability
to quickly understand and integrate different perspectives.

* propitious :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 16:59]

When the timing of something is propitious, it's likely to turn out
well. A propitious time for taking a big test is when you've studied
hard and had a good night's sleep.

If you believe in astrology, you might check your horoscope to settle
on a propitious day for your wedding. A propitious moment to ask your
parents about that spring break trip to Cancun might be when you've
just unveiled your straight-A report card.

I had to wait some days for what I considered to be a propitious moment.
* apparently :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 16:59]

Apparently is an adverb meaning "evidently" or "obviously." After his
sixth hot dog, you might say to your friend, "Well! Apparently
somebody was hungry!"

While apparently can mean "plainly" — like, duh — it can also mean
"seemingly," which is almost "evidently" or "obviously," but not
quite. There's a certain amount of guessing involved, based on
appearances. The park ranger who shows up in the morning to examine
the path of destruction through your campsite might say that it was
"apparently the work of a hungry bear," not because he's totally sure,
but because it definitely looks like something the bears around here
would do.

At the fourth attempt we
achieved what apparently Leslie considered to be success: the barrel burst and bits
of metal whined in all directions.
* unguardedly :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:03]

'Of course it's not difficult,' said Leslie, unguardedly, and then added hastily
'Well...
* hastily :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:03]

When you do something hastily you rush through it in a hurried manner.
If you write an essay hastily, don't expect an A.

Haste is speed, so if you do something hastily, you're just doing it
too fast. When a job should take time, like building a house, but it's
done hastily, something often goes wrong. If you hastily leave the
dinner table without explaining yourself, people will think you're
rude.

'Of course it's not difficult,' said Leslie, unguardedly, and then added hastily
'Well...
* interwoven :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:06]

When things are knitted or laced together, they're interwoven. Baskets
are traditionally made with interwoven strips of straw, bamboo, or
palm.

When you look closely at cloth, you can see it's made up of interwoven
fibers, and a bird's nest is an equally amazing construction of
interwoven twigs, leaves, and feathers. Hold hands with someone you
love, and your fingers may be interwoven. Figuratively, two things
like excitement and fear might also be interwoven, or linked together.
This adjective uses the prefix inter-, "between or among," and the
past participle of weave.

Leslie's trails of sawdust
and shaving through the house were now interwoven with a striking pattern of pink
footprints.
* larder :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:07]

When your mother buys groceries, she puts them in the larder or the
pantry. A larder is a room or cabinet where you store food.

Larder is an old-fashioned word, created back when people used lard —
rendered animal fat — to grease pans and cook food. The larder is
where they kept their bacon and their lard. Now it's where you keep
your potato chips and your cookies.

Secondly,
the larder had to be stocked up.
* unanimously :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:09]

If a group decides something unanimously, it means that every single
member is in agreement. A vote passed unanimously has no one objecting
to it.

When Congress passes a bill unanimously, each member agrees that it
should become a law. Things that are done or agreed on unanimously
have no dissenters, no one arguing against them — it's as if the group
were thinking as a single entity. In fact, the root of unanimously is
the Latin unanimus, "of one mind," from unus, "one," and animus,
"mind."

Having unanimously decided on
this, each member of the family then proceeded to invite ten people.
* consent :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:09]

Before you have surgery, you'd better give your consent, because the
surgeon can't get his scalpel anywhere near your skin without first
getting this permission from you.

Consent is permission that can be given or taken away. A father might
give his consent to allow a young man to marry his daughter, but he
might refuse that consent if he learns that the prospective groom has
a prison record. A homeowner who won't give a developer consent to
tear down her house and build a shopping mall might finally consent
after receiving a very large check from the developer.

After a week's arguing, accompanied by floods of tears,
we managed to get Lugaretzia to consent, but she had refused to go without moral
support.
* morrow :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:10]

It was
perfectly obvious that she would be in no condition to assist with the cooking and
other work on the morrow.
* scowled :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:11]

When you scowl you make an angry face. The angry face you make is also
called a scowl. Lighten up.

Scowl is an expressive word: it shares "ow" with frown, and if you say
it like you mean it you might end up scowling yourself. Being scowled
at is more unsettling than being frowned at. A scowl is like an angry
frown you would give someone if you disapproved of them. A frown
expresses sadness, but a scowl expresses disdain.

'Nevers you minds,' he scowled; 'leaves everything to me.'
* duly :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:12]

When you put in a lot of overtime hours at your job, you assume you'll
be duly paid. Duly means "properly" or "appropriately."

When something is done duly, it's expected, and it's considered proper
or right. If someone gives a great speech, you expect that he'll be
duly applauded for it. The word due is at the root of duly, and it
comes from the Old French word deu, or "to owe." Something that is
duly given can also be said to be owed. Be careful not to confuse
duly, which rhymes with the name "Julie," with dully, "without
liveliness."

My presents having been duly inspected and the
family thanked, I then went round to the back veranda with Leslie, and there lay a
mysterious shape covered with a tarpaulin.
* tarpaulin :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:12]

A tarpaulin is a heavy, waterproof piece of fabric that's used as a
protective cover or shelter. You might drape a tarpaulin over your
tent when it starts raining in the middle of your camping trip. Or you
can just go home.

Tarpaulins are often called tarps for short. The word probably
includes tar because of the original method for waterproofing a
tarpaulin, which involved spreading tar on a heavy piece of canvas.
The pall part means "cloth." During the 19th century, it was common to
abbreviate the word as paulin, especially in nautical terminology.

My presents having been duly inspected and the
family thanked, I then went round to the back veranda with Leslie, and there lay a
mysterious shape covered with a tarpaulin.
* rapturously :Durrell:

I gazed at it rapturously; it was surely the most
perfect boat that anyone had ever had.
* conjurer :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:14]

A conjurer is someone who can make an object magically appear. A
conjurer might pull a silver dollar from your ear or a rabbit out of a
hat.

You can use the noun conjurer for an actual magician, especially one
who specializes in making objects appear out of thin air. People who
seem to work magic can also be described this way: "I was worried when
we forgot our backpacks on the camping trip, but our counselor
produced extra clothes and sleeping bags like a conjurer!"

Leslie drew this aside with the air of a
conjurer, and there lay my boat.
* stoutly :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:15]

When you do something stoutly, you face it head on and bravely move
forward. A fairy tale knight fighting a dragon, for example, goes
stoutly into battle.

A nervous but brave kindergartner might walk stoutly through the
school doors on his first day, and a determined marathon racer pushes
stoutly on to the finish line. The adverb stoutly comes from the Old
French word estout, "brave, fierce, or proud," which in turn comes
from a West Germanic root, stult, "proud or stately."

I said stoutly that I thought
it was a lovely shape for a boat, and indeed I thought it was.
* evident :Durrell:

If something is evident, it's visible. If you blush furiously and
start shaking every time your crush comes near, your infatuation will
be evident to everyone.

Evident means conspicuously visible, often the mark of an action or a
feeling. If a room is in total disarray, with everything pulled out of
the drawers, it's evident that someone has been searching for
something. If you leave the room in the middle of a tense meeting,
your frustration will be evident. Evident can also simply mean
visible. If you look closely at a key hole of your car door, small
scratches will be evident in the paint.

Leslie, pleased at my
evident delight, said deprecatingly that he had been forced to make her
flat-bottomed, since, for a variety of technical reasons, this was the safest.
* stickler :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:19]

A stickler is someone who insists that things are done in a certain
way. Say you’re getting married and want to write your own vows, but
your partner’s mother demands that you have a traditional ceremony.
The mother is a stickler for tradition.

Stickler has its origins in a word meaning umpire, which may allude to
a stickler’s bossy nature. Difficult problems or puzzles are called
sticklers. It is helpful when remembering the definition of stickler
that it has the word “stick” in it. So someone who “sticks” to the
rules is a stickler.

Leslie, who was a
stickler for procedure, said you couldn't launch a ship without naming her, and had
I thought of a name yet?
* racked :Durrell:
[2018-08-19 Sun 17:19]

A rack is a device meant to hold something, or several things. A coat
rack has hooks for hanging coats, and a magazine rack has shelves or
slots to hold magazines.

In a store, racks hold and display items for sale (like clothes racks
and book racks), while in your house you have racks for storing things
(a spice rack), or drying them (in the case of a towel rack). If you
rack, or wrack, your brain, it means you think extra hard;and when
something goes "to rack and ruin," it becomes old and decrepit, or
falls apart.

They stood clustered round the boat, which looked
like a gigantic flower in their midst, and racked their brains.
* canny :Hill:
[2018-08-22 Wed 18:18]

If you're a canny investor, you know how to spend money to make money
— that is, you're prudent, farsighted, and capable of protecting your
own interests, particularly in matters of finance or business.

In contemporary usage, canny is a synonym for shrewd. Both words mean
smart or sharp-witted, but they also suggest that someone is smart in
a self-serving and possibly even tricky way. Canny is also related to
the word cunning — another adjective meaning wise, but with negative
connotations. Uncanny is not the opposite of canny — it means weird or
unsettling.

The canny, lovable old Scotsman carelessly
tossed it into my mind, when I was but a boy.
* stupendous :Hill:
[2018-08-22 Wed 18:19]

Stupendous means amazing or awesome. You just won a million dollars
and are donating it to charity? That’s stupendous!

While you might think of stupid as a mean word for someone who isn’t
smart, it can also mean senseless or stunned. If something stuns you
so much that you are amazed, it is stupendous. Think of a stupendous
performance or stupendous scenery. When something is big enough to
astound, also use this word. The tower rose to a stupendous height. It
would take a stupendous effort to improve your D in history to an A!

Carnegie's idea that the magic formula, which gave him a stupendous
fortune, ought to be placed within reach of people who do not have time
to investigate how men make money, and it was his hope that I might
test and demonstrate the soundness of the formula through the
experience of men and women in every calling.

A clergyman
used it so effectively that it brought him an income of upwards of
$75,000.00 a year.
* laudatory :Hill:
[2018-08-22 Wed 18:25]

Laudatory has to do with praise. If you do great things, then you've
done praise-worthy acts and people will use laudatory words when
talking about you.

We all probably do something laudable at some point. If you play
baseball well or just keep your room clean, then you probably receive
laudatory words of encouragement. If I say, "Your dog is the cutest,
nicest pooch in North America," I am saying laudatory things about
your dog. When you see laudatory, think praise.

The experiment was so
unique that newspapers and magazines, gave it more than a million
dollars' worth of laudatory publicity.
* surmount :Hill:
[2018-08-22 Wed 18:30]

If you surmount a challenge or difficult situation, you're not just
getting over it. You're outdoing yourself, exceeding expectations, and
overcoming the task at hand.

This word comes to us from the Old French verb for mount, or climb.
Maria sang "climb every mountain..." in The Sound of Music. But she
could have just as well meant "surmount every obstacle" — because to
surmount means to both reach the highest point of something, like a
mountain, and to totally overcome a mountain-size problem.

And, too, if you have ever been
discouraged, if you have had difficulties to surmount which took the
very soul out of you, if you have tried and failed, if you were ever
handicapped by illness or physical affliction, this story of my son's
discovery and use of the Carnegie formula may prove to be the oasis in
the Desert of Lost Hope, for which you have been searching.

And, too, if you have ever been
discouraged, if you have had difficulties to surmount which took the
very soul out of you, if you have tried and failed, if you were ever
handicapped by illness or physical affliction, this story of my son's
discovery and use of the Carnegie formula may prove to be the oasis in
the Desert of Lost Hope, for which you have been searching.
* mogul :satellite:
[2018-08-26 Sun 17:04]

If you’re the type of person who likes to be in charge, you may have
dreams of becoming a mogul — that is, a powerful businessperson.

Mogul is a variant of the word Mongol, which we often use to refer to
the empire once led by the famous (or infamous) Genghis Khan. The
Mogul Dynasty conquered India in the 16th century, and remained in
power for hundreds of year. As a result, the word mogul became
synonymous with "leader" or "ruler."

When Richard Branson wanted to start an airline, he borrowed from his 10,000 hours
of being a music mogul.
* resentments :satellite:
[2018-08-26 Sun 17:06]

Resentment, or the strong and painful bitterness you feel when someone
does something wrong to you, doesn’t have actual physical weight, but
it feels very heavy and can last a long time. Forgiveness is one way
to get rid of resentment.

Sometimes resentment lasts for years. It can be strong and hard to
pull out, like an old, gnarled tree root. While resentment over being
wronged can come from just one act against you, it also can get
stronger over time, as in "your growing resentment might just come
from the fact that the team captain always picks you last." It also
comes from misunderstandings, like feeling resentment over a dirty
look you thought was directed at you but really wasn't. It's usually
best to root out resentment early.

It means throw out resentments, jealousies, angers, etc.
* convinced :Hill:
[2018-08-26 Sun 17:33]

If you're convinced that the moon is made of cheese, then you
completely believe the moon is made of cheese. Let's hope you're not
easily convinced of such silly things!

When we are convinced of something, we really, sincerely believe it.
We think it's true. For example, if someone told you the President
used to live underground as a mole person, I hope you wouldn't be
convinced too easily. Unfortunately, even when someone has convinced
us of something, that doesn't mean it's true. Someone who can be
convinced of absolutely anything, no matter how untrue, is called
gullible.

If you doubt this, study the
names of those who have used it, wherever they have been mentioned,
check their records for yourself, and be convinced.
* retorted :Hill:
[2018-08-26 Sun 17:37]

A retort is a short, clever response to someone's comment or question.
If you want to keep the peace during dinner, you should probably bite
your tongue instead of making sarcastic retorts to everything your
little sister says.

Today retort is used as both a noun and a verb, and both come from
16th- and 17th-century sources meaning "to twist or turn back." To
retort is to make a comeback, or a quick, witty answer or remark. It
can be a form of payback when someone tries to insult or tease another
person, and often, the perfect retort doesn't occur to you till later,
when you think "Oh! I wish I had said that earlier!"

"I'll not do it," the uncle retorted, "Now you run on home."
* defy :Hill:
[2018-08-26 Sun 17:39]

To defy is to openly refuse to do something. You can defy the
no-costumes-in-class rule if you wear your fairy wings to school, but
just don’t try to defy the laws of gravity unless you can actually
fly.

If you deliberately break a rule or ignore an order, you defy, or
resist, that rule. The word defy comes from the Latin word disfidare
for "renounce one's faith." So if you're expected to be faithful to a
certain law or rule but you refuse to be, you defy it. There are
different ways to defy — defy your parents by staying out past curfew,
or defy common sense by walking in with shoes on your head.

He knew that colored children
were not supposed to defy white people in that part of the country.
* docile :Hill:
[2018-08-26 Sun 17:41]

If someone is docile, he is easily taught or handled. If you suddenly
became a trouble-maker in class, your teachers would long for the days
when you were sweet and docile.

Docile comes from Latin root for teaching, docere, so someone docile
is easy to teach. A docile student is willing to be taught. A docile
animal is easy to handle. If you behave well and do what people tell
you to do, you're a docile person. Docile might be a word of praise,
but it can also be a criticism of someone for being overly submissive.
Some synonyms are amenable and compliant.

What happened to his uncle that
caused him to lose his fierceness and become as docile as a lamb?
* illiterate :Hill:
[2018-08-26 Sun 21:28]

You can describe a person unable to read or write as illiterate.
Karaoke, which involves singing out the words to songs as they scroll
across a big screen, requires the ability to read. If you’re
illiterate, you won’t be able to participate.

Illiterate, from the Latin illiteratus “unlearned, ignorant,” can
describe someone unable to read or write, but it can also imply that a
person lacks cultural awareness. However, Walt Whitman saw a unique
beauty to illiteracy: “There is that indescribable freshness and
unconsciousness about an illiterate person that humbles and mocks the
power of the noblest expressive genius.”

Strangely, too, I had devoted nearly a quarter of a century to the
study of the power which enabled an ignorant, illiterate colored child
to conquer an intelligent man.

Darby the power unwittingly used by the
little colored child, he quickly retraced his thirty years of
experience as a life insurance salesman, and frankly acknowledged that
his success in that field was due, in no small degree, to the lesson he
had learned from the child.
* imponderable :Hill:
[2018-08-26 Sun 21:32]

Imponderable describes a situation that isn't able to be completely
explained. "What is the meaning of life?" is one of those imponderable
questions that defies humans' ability for understanding

If something is ponderable, it is capable of being assessed or
weighed; stick im- in front and you get the opposite effect. Use
imponderable to describe something that is elusive and vague, perhaps
even evasive. When your question doesn't have a definitive answer, you
are in imponderable territory: "Life has many imponderable questions,
such as why you park in a driveway and drive on parkway."

Life is strange, and often imponderable!
* impatient :satellite:
[2018-08-27 Mon 14:24]

If you are impatient, you don’t like to wait. Do you have a hard time
teaching children new skills? Do grab the shoe and tie it yourself?
You’re impatient.

Pent-up, antsy, restless, short-tempered, constantly checking the time
— all of these are qualities of an impatient person. Patient comes
from the Latin word patientem, meaning "to endure," but add the prefix
im- and you get impatient — the inability to endure delays, mix-ups,
people walking slowly, red lights. . .

Human beings are inherently impatient.

But the great irony of success (in any area of life) is that an approach that is
overly focused on speed will actually force you to go slower.
* groggy :satellite:
[2018-08-27 Mon 14:27]

If you feel a little confused or foggy-headed you can say that you are
groggy. When you first wake up, you might be groggy until you get up
and start moving around.

The adjective groggy comes from the noun grog, which was what the
sailors back in the 1700’s called rum diluted with water. Today, grog
is slang for any liquor. To feel groggy is to feel drunk, tipsy, weak
or dazed. Boxers who’ve sustained numerous blows to the head can get
pretty groggy, and they might stagger around the ring — a sign that
they are feeling out of it.

The next day, he wakes up on time again, this time much more groggy and fuzzy
headed.
* fuzzy :satellite:
[2018-08-27 Mon 14:27]

Fuzzy things are soft, downy, or furry. Few people can resist the
charms of a tiny, fuzzy kitten.

Your dad's bearded face is fuzzy, and your favorite mohair sweater is
also fuzzy. You can also use this adjective to mean "blurry" or
"clouded," the way a badly lit scene in a movie might look fuzzy, with
vague shapes moving in the dark. The inside of your head can feel
fuzzy too, when you're groggy or dizzy: "I remember getting hit in the
head by the soccer ball, but after that everything's fuzzy."

The next day, he wakes up on time again, this time much more groggy and fuzzy
headed.
* rut :satellite:
[2018-08-27 Mon 14:30]

A rut is a groove in the earth, like an indent caused by wheels. It's
also a boring routine that can be hard to break. If you’re stuck in a
rut, you’ve been doing the same old thing for too long.

If you see a groove in the ground, especially one caused by a bike or
car, that's a rut. If a rut is deep enough, you could get stuck in it,
which may be why the word has another meaning. If your life has become
boring, stale, and monotonous, you're in a rut. Someone who works the
same job for decades may feel like they're in a rut and need to make a
change.

1 His health - his energy levels suck and he’s always tired and feels incapable of
 working on a side hustle or going to the gym
2 His finances - He’s buried in debt, living paycheck to paycheck, and stuck in a
 rut of being unable to earn any more.
* fiancee :satellite:
[2018-08-27 Mon 14:35]

A fiancée is a woman engaged to be married. On the Muppet Show, Miss
Piggy was Kermit's fiancée and covered him in kisses.

A fiancée is a woman engaged to be married; a man engaged to be
married is a fiancé — two "e"s for a woman, one for a man — according
to French spelling conventions. Fiancée, from mid-19th century French,
means "a woman to whom one is betrothed" and is linked to the noun
fiance, which refers to "a promise." In other words, a bride-to-be is
promised to a groom-to-be, and vice versa.

* shudder :satellite:
[2018-08-29 Wed 17:33]

A shudder is an involuntary vibration, usually in your body, or the
shaking itself. A cold breeze or an unpleasant memory might make you
shudder.

A shudder isn't always a bad thing. It can mean a pleasurable
sensation or tingle that goes through your body, like a shudder of
excitement you feel when you see your favorite star on the street. As
a verb, shudder means to shake and shiver. Being really cold or seeing
something that scares you — a ghost! — can make you shudder. The
phrase "shudder to think" means just the thought of something upsets
you enough to shudder.

How he made the British
shudder with his simplicity and steadfastness?
* steadfastness :satellite:
[2018-08-29 Wed 17:34]

This is an oft said but nevertheless understated lesson.
* slaughter :satellite:
[2018-08-29 Wed 17:57]

Slaughter refers to the killing of large numbers of animals or people.
When cattle are old enough, they're sent to slaughter and their meat
is processed and shipped to stores.

The noun slaughter was first used in the 1300s and comes from the Old
Norse word slahtr, which also described the mass killing of animals or
people. A verb form came along later, in the 1530s. You might hear
slaughter used to describe the killing of large numbers of people in a
war, a genocide, or a massacre. It also can be used figuratively to
describe a crushing defeat, like the slaughter of your basketball team
by your bitter rivals.

I do not doubt that Hindus are
forbidden the slaughter of cows.
* hostility :satellite:
[2018-08-29 Wed 17:57]

Hostility is the state of ill will and bad feeling. If a teacher
embarrasses you in front of the whole class, you will probably regard
him or her with hostility for the remainder of the school year.

Hostility can be used to describe aggressive relations between two
countries as well as between people. The issue of territorial borders
can often cause hostility between neighboring countries. If actual
fighting breaks out, use the word hostilities to refer to the violent
actions between them. The ordinary citizens of the countries involved
will look forward to the end of hostilities when the two governments
are able to work together for peace.

He faced opposition, backlash, public hostility, but he kept his
ground.
* limpid :Durrell:
[2018-08-30 Thu 10:14]

The adjective limpid describes something (often liquid) that is clear,
serene and bright. Nature calendars often feature glamour shots of a
limpid stream or a limpid lake.

The adjective limpid may also describe language that is easily
understandable. Your teacher might ask you to give an answer in a
single limpid sentence. But he probably won't because limpid is a word
that's fallen out of use. Maybe because it sounds too much like limp.
Or maybe because it's associated with the king of all clichés: "Her
eyes were like limpid pools."

Our trips there became less and less frequent, in spite of
all arguments on my part, and I was tortured by the thought of all
the wonderful animal life waiting in the limpid pools to be caught;
but I was unable to do anything about it, simply because I had no
boat.
* resignedly                                                        :Durrell:

It was, I realized resignedly, quite useless to
ask Larry for anything like formalin or pins, but if my list showed
some sort of literary leaning I stood a good chance.
