  continues to [delight] us," to suggest that the first impression
  continues. The word [delight] derives from the Latin delectare "to
  charm," which also gives us delectable, and the same lighthearted
  sense of pure, uncomplicated pleasure.

  is run down or shabby and you're trying to say something positive,
  you might substitute "How...[quaint]" for "How...interesting." In
  Middle English, this adjective meant clever or cunning. Its origin
  is Old French queinte, cointe, from Latin cognitus "known," from
  cognōscere "to learn."

  The word [incisive] is rooted in a Latin word that literally means "to
  cut with a sharp edge." To help you remember the meaning, you can
  think of the similar word, incisors, which are the teeth that are
  sharp and cut and tear. The more figurative meaning of describing
  something that is mentally sharp first appeared in the 1850s. Keen
  criticism and cutting remarks have been called [incisive] ever since.

  Imagine someone walking awkwardly on a pair of stilts and you have a
  good impression of the word [stilted] — wooden and stiff. Stilt is
  found in the mid-15th century, referring to walking on wooden stilts
  across marshy ground. A hundred years later, the word [stilted] came
  to refer to the posts holding up a building. It wasn't until 1820
  that the word was used as we use it now, to describe writing or
  speaking that does not flow smoothly.

  [Incumbent] comes from the Latin word incumbens, which means lying in
  or leaning on, but came to mean holding a position. It was first
  used in English for someone holding a church office, and then
  someone holding any office. You'll most likely hear it today for
  political officials. In a race for mayor, the [incumbent] mayor faces
  a challenger. [Incumbent] also means obligation. It is [incumbent] upon
  you to do the dishes.

  [Flourish] can also mean "growth": "With the right teacher, a child
  will [flourish]." To understand how the two meanings of [flourish]
  connect, remember that the word "flower" (spelled flour-) is hiding
  inside it. Flowers are used for decoration and ornamentation, but
  they also grow. Get it? Good for you! Imagine a cheerleader shouting

  The House of Representatives has a couple of ways to punish naughty
  members. One way is to [reprimand] them by voting to express
  disapproval. In 2009, Representative Joe Wilson was [reprimand]ed
  after his outburst of "You lie!" during President Obama's speech. In
  the halls of Congress, this is considered "unparliamentary
  language," but if you yell at your congressman, that's okay.

  In a cartoon, a mouse might ask an approaching cat, "Hey, what's
  that up in the sky?" When the cat looks up, the mouse runs away,
  successful in his attempt to [deflect] the cat's attention. When you
  [deflect], you throw someone or something off course, often by using a
  distraction. Another way to [deflect] something — such as criticism —
  is to blame someone else. Eventually the truth, like the cat who
  quickly sees there's nothing unusual up in the sky, catches up with
  those who [deflect].

  First used to imply a “slip of the memory,” the noun [lapse] evolved
  in the sixteenth century from the Latin lapsus, meaning “a slipping
  and falling, falling into error.” The connotation of “a moral slip”
  developed later, and the verb form came into existence even later
  than that. Behaving badly one day when you're usually on your best
  behavior is a [lapse]; Behaving badly again after a short stint being
  well-mannered means you're lapsing back into nasty old habits.

  The Greek word that [predicament] originally descends from means "a
  state of being." Which makes sense considering the words that sound
  like predicate are all about states of being––predict, or say what's
  going to happen in the future, and predicate the second part of a
  sentence that's led by the verb. Think of [predicament] as an
  unpleasant state of being.

* wacky :satellite:
[2018-04-25 Wed 15:24]

Something that's wacky is weird or nutty or silly. Your goofy uncle
who wears a funny hat and does magic tricks at the dinner table is
wacky.

Use the adjective wacky when you're talking about someone with a
ridiculous sense of humor. Clowns are, by definition, wacky, for
example. Most people have at least one wacky relative, and some are
lucky enough to have entire wacky families. Wacky comes from the
nineteenth century British slang term whacky, which arose from whack,
specifically the idea of getting whacked on the head so hard that it
turns you wacky.

EDIT: People ask all kinds of wacky hypothetical question in interviews such as asking candidates to hand-construct routine algorithms that can
easily be picked out of a textbook.
* prickly :satellite:
[2018-04-25 Wed 15:27]

Prickly things are sharp and spiky, while prickly people are quick to
be offended or irritated. Ouch!

A prickly tag in the collar of your new shirt can make you
uncomfortable all day, and so can a prickly co-worker whose feelings
seem to get hurt by everything you say. Porcupines and cactuses are
prickly, and so is the next-door neighbor who is constantly irritated
with you. The first thing that was described as prickly, in the 1570s,
was a holly leaf.

Those folks would be no fun to work with – too defensive and prickly.
* churn :satellite:
[2018-04-25 Wed 15:41]

A churn is a container that you fill with cream and then agitate until
the cream becomes butter. You may have only bought butter at the
store, but your ancestors probably used a traditional plunger-type
churn to make their own.

The verb churn means to mix cream until it turns into butter,
separating out the buttermilk. You can make your own butter by
churning it in a jar if you don't have a churn, shaking heavy cream
until it becomes solid. To churn can also simply mean to agitate, like
a boat might churn in a turbulent ocean, or your stomach might churn
with anxiety about your big test the next day.

You can get me drunk, make me tired, distract me,
give me a bad boss, and I’ll still churn code out at an even pace…
* stride :satellite:
[2018-04-25 Wed 15:42]

The noun stride means "significant progress." You might make a huge
stride towards making peace with the rival school by hosting a block
party and inviting their students.

The noun stride also means "a step made while running or walking." If
you are bored, you can count your strides between home and the bus
stop. As a verb, stride means "to walk or run by taking long steps."
Elite runners stride, making it look easy. But even if you are a slow
jogger, don't give up — you make great strides to improve your health
when you exercise regularly.

Experienced guys take
that stuff in stride.
* thorough :satellite:
[2018-04-25 Wed 15:43]

Thorough describes something that is painstakingly complete, like a
thorough search for your missing keys in which you look for them in
coat pockets, under the table, in the refrigerator — in every single
place you can think of.

Thorough rhymes with "burrow": "THUR-oh." It looks a lot like through
but remember thorough is an adjective, so you might use it to describe
a thorough investigation or a thorough review. In contrast through is
used most often as a preposition — you might look through every
drawer, for example, in a search — or as an adverb — you might see a
hole in your pocket where coins fall through.

Beginners severely underestimate the importance of testing, test cases, how to be
thorough when testing etc.
* genuine :satellite:
[2018-04-25 Wed 17:25]

Genuine things are true or authentic. When you're talking about
people, being genuine has to do with being sincere.

This word has to do with things and people that are true. A genuine
blonde is a real blonde — no hair dye involved. A genuine friend is a
real friend you can trust when the chips are down. Genuine feelings
are real feelings — not fake feelings put on as a show. A genuine
hundred dollar bill is the real McCoy, not a counterfeit bill. When
something is the real thing, it's genuine.

The students
were then asked to distinguish between the genuine notes and the fake ones.
* fictitious :satellite:
[2018-04-25 Wed 17:26]

Fictitious means made up, or imaginary. No matter how real Scarlett
O'Hara might seem in "Gone With the Wind," she's a fictitious
character invented by author Margaret Mitchell.

When you look at the word fictitious, you'll probably notice that it
bears a striking resemblance to fiction — which is an imaginary story
about people and events that are made up for the purpose of
entertaining readers. Fictitious can also be used to mean "trick or
deceive." A thief assumes a fictitious name to hide his real identity
and evade capture.

Though
half the notes were indeed genuine—they’d been obtained from the Los Angeles County
coroner’s office—the scores were fictitious.
* deception :satellite:
[2018-04-25 Wed 17:27]

Deception is a trick or scheme used to get what you want, like the
deception you used to get your sister to agree to do all your chores
for a month.

Deception occurs when you deceive, a word that comes from the Latin
de- meaning "from" and capere, meaning "to take." When you deceive
someone, the result may be taking — like items you don't really need
from people willing to give them, believing they are helping you. You
may have heard the phrase "take someone for a ride." That's a way of
describing deception.

In the second phase of the study, the deception was revealed.
* gauge :satellite:
[2018-04-25 Wed 17:27]

If you ask your friend, "How do you feel, generally, about loaning
your car to people?" your intention might be to gauge his reaction
before you flat-out ask if you can borrow his car. To gauge is to
measure or test.

The verb gauge means to estimate or measure, while the noun gauge is a
tool you can use to make such a measurement. If you've ever seen
someone check the air pressure in a tire, the instrument she used was
called a tire gauge. The thickness, or diameter, of an item like wire
(or the barrel of a gun) is another meaning of gauge.

The students were told
that the real point of the experiment was to gauge their responses to thinking they
were right or wrong.

* bogged :satellite:
[2018-04-26 Thu 14:00]

You'd be pretty soggy by morning if you accidentally set your tent up
in a bog. A bog is a swampy kind of ground made up mostly of
decomposing plants and mosses.

Nothing can be built on a bog because the ground is so spongy and
damp, and no crops can be grown there. The dried soil from a bog can,
however, be dried and burned for fuel. A figurative bog is anything
that you tend to get stuck in, like a bog of health problems. Things
can also "bog you down", or slow you down literally or figuratively,
like when your homework bogs you down so you can't enjoy the weekend.

"we got bogged down in interminable discussions"
* rabid :satellite:
[2018-04-28 Sat 09:34]

Chances are that if the tail-wagging dog that just appeared on your
doorstep is also foaming at the mouth and chewing on your welcome mat,
it's rabid and you should back away slowly; no petting for this
infectious pup.

While you've likely heard it used to describe an animal infected by
rabies, rabid (derived from the Latin verb rabere "be mad, rave") can
also dramatically describe a person exhibiting fanatical, extremely
enthusiastic, or raging behavior. That guy who nearly knocked you off
the stands at the football game with his energetic fist-pumping and
then was later kicked out for getting into a fight with another fan?
Rabid on both counts.

Angry rabid dogs, smog clouds, and annoying
  little brothers are all probable [menace]s.
* translucent :satellite:
[2018-04-28 Sat 09:40]

A translucent material lets light pass through, but objects on the
other side can't be seen clearly. Think Shrinky Dinks or stained
glass.

In contrast, a transparent material allows you to clearly see the
objects on the other side. Frosted glass is translucent, and regular
glass is transparent. But opaque glass doesn't let any light through
at all, and so you can't see through it. The adjective translucent is
from Latin translucens, from translucere "to shine through."

a thin translucent fabric of silk, linen, or cotton.
* trickle :satellite:
[2018-05-02 Wed 08:36]

To trickle is to weakly flow out of something, like a faucet. A
trickle is like a drip.

There are a lot of ways water can flow, but one type of slow dripping
is called trickling. If your shower is only releasing a trickle of
water, you're not going to get much of a shower. If it's raining — but
only a trickle — you might not need an umbrella. A slightly leaky roof
is trickling. A trickle is the opposite of a downpour or flood.
Trickling can also be called dribbling.

That trickle of sweat didn't just miraculously appear — it was
  secreted out of a [pore], a really tiny opening on the surface of your
  skin.

That trickle of sweat didn't just miraculously appear — it was
  secreted out of a [pore], a really tiny opening on the surface of your
  skin.
* deity :satellite:
[2018-05-02 Wed 08:54]

A deity is a supernatural being, like a god or goddess, that is
worshipped by people who believe it controls or exerts force over some
aspect of the world.

The word deity means "divine nature." It was coined by Saint
Augustine, a theologian whose writings were very influential in the
shaping of Western Christianity. Deity comes from the Latin word for
"god": deus. The divine nature of deities is believed to be immortal
goodness and powerfulness.

Think of a [supplication] as sort of a prayer, a request for help
  from a deity.
* adoration :satellite:
[2018-05-02 Wed 08:54]

Adoration is a feeling of deep love. Some people may say animals don't
have emotions, but you know from the adoration in your dog's eyes that
it's just not true.

The noun adoration comes from the Latin word adorationem, which means
"worship," particularly in a religious way. Adoration is still used
today in a religious context, in phrases like "the adoration of God."
If you adore or deeply love someone, you can describe that feeling as
adoration. It's the kind of feeling Romeo had for Juliet, devoted fans
have for a pop star, and you have for your beloved cat.

The word carries a sense of awe and adoration with it,
  suggesting something tentative, even servile, a respectful appeal to
  a higher power.
* tentative :satellite:
[2018-05-02 Wed 08:54]

Choose the adjective tentative to describe something you are unsure or
hesitant about. On Monday, you can make tentative plans for the
weekend, but it's too early to commit to one party or another.

Tentative, from the Latin tentātīvus "testing, trying," always
describes something that is uncertain. If you make a tentative
appointment, write it down in pencil, not pen, because it might have
to be changed. Here the opposite of tentative is definite or set. If
someone gives you a tentative smile or nod, the person feels hesitant
or unsure about something. In this case, its opposite is confident.

The word carries a sense of awe and adoration with it,
  suggesting something tentative, even servile, a respectful appeal to
  a higher power.
* servile :satellite:
[2018-05-02 Wed 08:55]

If you want to get someone to like you, don't offer to fetch them a
Coke, rub their feet, or do their homework. They won't like you any
better, and your servile attitude will only cost you their respect.

To remember servile, just think of the word servant––they both derive
from the Latin servus "slave." In fact, servile also means anything
characteristic of a slave. "After winning the lottery, the ex-slave
shed first his servile clothes, later his servile manner. The
transformation was complete."

The word carries a sense of awe and adoration with it,
  suggesting something tentative, even servile, a respectful appeal to
  a higher power.
* appeal :satellite:
[2018-05-02 Wed 08:56]

Appeal means to ask, or address. If you appeal to someone's better
nature, you're asking them for mercy. If a shirt doesn't appeal to
you, you could also say it doesn't "speak" to you, or more simply, you
don't like it.

Appeal also means to call upon a higher court to review a lower
court's decision. If you appeal a court's conviction of you for shop
lifting, you're asking a higher court to throw the decision out.
Appeal descends from the Latin appellare "to address, call upon."

The word carries a sense of awe and adoration with it,
  suggesting something tentative, even servile, a respectful appeal to
  a higher power.
