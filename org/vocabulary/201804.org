  continues to [delight] us," to suggest that the first impression
  continues. The word [delight] derives from the Latin delectare "to
  charm," which also gives us delectable, and the same lighthearted
  sense of pure, uncomplicated pleasure.

  or torment," which may sometimes be a good description of how an
  [afflicted] person feels. Those with mental illness may be tormented

  real from what is not. Those [afflicted] by ALS, or Lou Gehrig's
  Disease, slowly lose control of their muscles and become paralyzed.

  There is a commonly used sarcastic sense of [quaint]––when something
  is run down or shabby and you're trying to say something positive,
  you might substitute "How...[quaint]" for "How...interesting." In
  Middle English, this adjective meant clever or cunning. Its origin
  is Old French queinte, cointe, from Latin cognitus "known," from
  cognōscere "to learn."

  means a flaw in an argument that makes it deceptive or misleading.
  In poetry, the "pathetic [fallacy]" is the false idea that things like
  rocks or stars have human feelings (pathos). [Fallacy] can also be
  used more generally for any false statement or idea. Some synonyms
  are misconception and error.

  The word [incisive] is rooted in a Latin word that literally means "to
  cut with a sharp edge." To help you remember the meaning, you can
  think of the similar word, incisors, which are the teeth that are
  sharp and cut and tear. The more figurative meaning of describing
  something that is mentally sharp first appeared in the 1850s. Keen
  criticism and cutting remarks have been called [incisive] ever since.

  Imagine someone walking awkwardly on a pair of stilts and you have a
  good impression of the word [stilted] — wooden and stiff. Stilt is
  found in the mid-15th century, referring to walking on wooden stilts
  across marshy ground. A hundred years later, the word [stilted] came
  to refer to the posts holding up a building. It wasn't until 1820
  that the word was used as we use it now, to describe writing or
  speaking that does not flow smoothly.

  [Incumbent] comes from the Latin word incumbens, which means lying in
  or leaning on, but came to mean holding a position. It was first
  used in English for someone holding a church office, and then
  someone holding any office. You'll most likely hear it today for
  political officials. In a race for mayor, the [incumbent] mayor faces
  a challenger. [Incumbent] also means obligation. It is [incumbent] upon

  [Flourish] can also mean "growth": "With the right teacher, a child
  will [flourish]." To understand how the two meanings of [flourish]
  connect, remember that the word "flower" (spelled flour-) is hiding

  In a cartoon, a mouse might ask an approaching cat, "Hey, what's

  successful in his attempt to [deflect] the cat's attention. When you

  blood. Some [clot]s are useful, like the ones that form on skin that's

  — can be harmful. [Clot] can also be a verb, meaning to clog or

  in French means "fake." Now if we have the words fake, imitation,

  First used to imply a “slip of the memory,” the noun [lapse] evolved
  in the sixteenth century from the Latin lapsus, meaning “a slipping
  and falling, falling into error.” The connotation of “a moral slip”
  developed later, and the verb form came into existence even later
  than that. Behaving badly one day when you're usually on your best
  behavior is a [lapse]; Behaving badly again after a short stint being
  well-mannered means you're lapsing back into nasty old habits.

  The Greek word that [predicament] originally descends from means "a
  state of being." Which makes sense considering the words that sound
  like predicate are all about states of being––predict, or say what's
  going to happen in the future, and predicate the second part of a
  sentence that's led by the verb. Think of [predicament] as an
  unpleasant state of being.

  One way to remember the verb [ensue] is to rhyme it with "due." A
  happening that is due to happen will [ensue], "Throwing a glass of ice
  water in his face guaranteed that a chase would [ensue]." Often what

  what will happen as a consequence. A struggle might [ensue] if a thief
  grabs a purse, and a discussion might [ensue] if two sides disagree.

  Before it came to mean "spread liberally" in the nineteenth century,

  Today we use this informal verb to describe smearing or rubbing, so

  our sunburnt skin, and [slather] peanut butter and jelly on bread.

  [Deception] occurs when you deceive, a word that comes from the Latin
  de- meaning "from" and capere, meaning "to take." When you deceive
  someone, the result may be taking — like items you don't really need
  from people willing to give them, believing they are helping you.
  You may have heard the phrase "take someone for a ride." That's a
  way of describing [deception].

  The noun [adoration] comes from the Latin word [adoration]em, which
  means "worship," particularly in a religious way. [Adoration] is still
  used today in a religious context, in phrases like "the [adoration] of
  God." If you adore or deeply love someone, you can describe that
  feeling as [adoration]. It's the kind of feeling Romeo had for Juliet,
  devoted fans have for a pop star, and you have for your beloved cat.
