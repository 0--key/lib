Do you like to eat and drink — I mean, really like to eat and drink?
Then you might be a glutton.

We all have our favorite foods and drinks, but some people are a
little more into it than others — these people are gluttons. Someone
who's a glutton because they just eat too much is different from a
gourmet or gourmand, who enjoys only the best food. This word also is
used in phrases like "glutton for punishment," which you might say
about a student who asks for extra homework.

He's such a =glutton= that he ate the whole cake.
