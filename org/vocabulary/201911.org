* coarse :Duke:
[2019-10-29 Tue 11:32]

Coarse can mean rough to the touch or vulgar. It's good to have coarse
sand paper, but not good to have coarse manners.

Do you lick your dinner plate, wipe your nose on your sleeve, and
generally behave like an oaf? No, of course not. You're the kind of
person who reads online dictionaries. But if you did do any of things,
you'd be coarse — that is, unrefined, boorish, and downright vulgar.
Coarse can apply to a wide variety of things other than behavior. If
something is of poor quality, cheap and inferior, it's considered
coarse.

Therefore, the “parts” of
this book provide only a coarse classification of topics.
* hype :Duke:
[2019-10-30 Wed 16:53]

As a noun, hype means extravagant claims about a person or product.
All the hype about a miraculous new kind of mop might influence you to
buy one, but after trying it out you'll realize it's just a mop.

Experts speculate that the word hype may be a back formation of
hyperbole, or it may come from hyper — old-fashioned slang for a
person who swindled someone. As a verb, to hype something is to
blatantly promote it. If you hype your favorite restaurant enough,
your friends will finally try it. If they all hate it, though, they
might never listen to you again!

In our presentation, we aim for
professionalism rather than cuteness, and we’d rather
understate a point than hype it.
* riveting :Duke:
[2019-10-30 Wed 17:01]

A rivet is a fastener that holds something closed or down, and
something riveting keeps you glued to your seat and grabs your
attention. Sometimes a movie is so riveting that not even free popcorn
refills can lure you away.

Riveting is an adjective for things that really draw you in, like a
book you read in one sitting or a song you turn up so you can hear
every lyric. Beautiful scenes are riveting, but terrible and ugly
things are also riveting, like the site of an accident you can't stop
looking at. Words from a teacher or actor have a riveting effect when
they're full of impact and interest, and when you exaggerate a story
for your best friend, that's riveting too.

If you pass a Try this without trying – maybe
because you are not near a computer or you find the text
riveting — do return to it when you do the chapter drill; a
Try this either complements the chapter drill or is a part
of it.

This allows us
to be economical with space (and your time) and also to
emphasize that programming is more than simply slinging
code together to get a result as quickly as possible.
* worthwhile :Duke:
[2019-11-04 Mon 09:26]

Things that are worthwhile are good — they're worth the time or money
you spend on them.

If you walked out of the theater and said "Wow, I'm glad I saw that
movie!", then your film viewing trip was worthwhile. If going to the
gym helped you get in better shape, it was worthwhile. If hanging out
in the park made you happy, it was worthwhile. If something is a total
waste of time and you wish you hadn't done it, then it wasn't
worthwhile.

In this chapter, we lift our eyes from
the technical details and consider the big picture: Why is
programming a worthwhile activity?
* stitch :Duke:
[2019-11-04 Mon 09:33]

When a needle pulls thread through fabric and into a loop, that's a
stitch. Every quilt, no matter how elaborate, starts with a single
stitch.

You can stitch a design on a pillow, or stitch up a hole in your jeans
using stitches. Doctors sometimes stitch up patients' skin, too — if
you cut yourself badly enough, you might need stitches. Another kind
of stitch is a painful cramp in your stomach or side: "I stopped
running when I got a stitch." If someone says, "I haven't got a stitch
to wear," they're short on clothing. And being "in stitches" means
laughing uncontrollably.

The management of the
distribution networks is of course computerized, as are the
communication systems that stitch them all together.
* utensils :Duke:
[2019-11-04 Mon 09:37]

A utensil is a tool you can hold in your hand and use around the
house. In the kitchen, common utensils are the knives, forks, and
spoons that we hold in our hands and use to eat.

The word utensil comes from the Latin utensilia meaning "things for
use." A pen is a writing utensil. A spatula is a cooking utensil. A
scrub brush is a cleaning utensil. A knife is a cutting utensil. All
of these objects can be held in your hand and are used to get
something done.

The superior quality of
modern photographic lenses and the exquisite shapes in
the design of modern everyday gadgets and utensils owe
almost everything to computer-based design and
production methods.
* exaggeration :Duke:
[2019-11-05 Tue 12:51]

If you're prone to exaggeration, it means you habitually overstate the
truth. If you have a dog and a hamster, it would be an exaggeration to
describe yourself as "practically Doctor Dolittle," living in a house
full of animals.

When you make something showier, or more noticeable than normal,
that's also called exaggeration. The exaggeration of your hand
movements might be necessary on stage so the audience can see them,
but in real life it just looks silly. Exaggeration comes from the
Latin word exaggerare, which means to magnify or to heap or pile on.

That may be an exaggeration, but there is something
to the idea of looking at a simple artifact and thinking
about what it implies.
* nitpicking :Duke:
[2019-11-05 Tue 14:16]

When you nitpick, you focus on small, specific mistakes. An English
teacher might nitpick by pointing out an unnecessary comma in your
otherwise perfect 20-page paper.

People who nitpick are bothered by minor problems — or else they're
just looking for something to criticize. A movie critic who dislikes a
director might nitpick about her latest film's slight inaccuracies.
Your mom might nitpick about your outfit, saying, "It's a shame your
socks don't quite match." Nitpick was first used in 1962, and
nitpicker came first, from the idea that nitpickers search for faults
the way they might pick nits, or lice eggs, from someone's hair.

We want “the machine” to do things
that are difficult enough for us to want help with them, but
computers are nitpicking, unforgiving, dumb beasts.
* hitherto :Duke:
[2019-11-05 Tue 14:20]

Use the adverb hitherto when you're describing a state or circumstance
that existed up until now. If you find a hitherto undiscovered hidden
tunnel in your cellar, you're the first to discover it.

When some particular situation has existed so far, up until the moment
that you're speaking of, you can use the word hitherto to talk about
it. You could say that you're taking a hot air balloon ride that you
were hitherto too scared to contemplate, or that a very shy girl in
your philosophy class who was hitherto totally silent finally spoke up
today and asked a very intelligent question.

We typically start
with analysis, but feedback from testing can help improve the
programming; problems with getting the program working may indicate a
problem with the design; and working with the design may suggest
aspects of the problem that hitherto had been overlooked in the
analysis.
* permeates :Duke:
[2019-11-05 Tue 14:34]

When you live in a big city like New York, you know all too well how
the smells of spices and cooking meats can permeate a hallway, easily
passing through those thin apartment doors to make your mouth water.

The verb permeate literally means to "pass through." It's often used
to describe smells or liquids that not only pass through, but also
spread to fill an entire area. When you bake cookies, you'll notice
that the rich, sweet smell of those cookies isn't confined just to
your oven — it permeates the entire kitchen and even the whole house.
In science class, you might have learned about a permeable membrane —
a thin material that is porous enough to let liquids or gases to pass
through.

We are obviously in awe of the range of software that permeates our
technological civilization.
* excruciating :Duke:
[2019-11-05 Tue 17:30]

Something that’s really intense or painful is excruciating. If you go
skiing and break your leg in several places, the ride from the slope
to the hospital will be excruciating — unless you're unconscious, too.

Excruciating doesn't just hurt. It feels like torture. This adjective
actually comes to us from the Latin excruciatus, which means “to
afflict, harass, vex, torment.” Extremely painful injuries are
certainly excruciating, but sometimes so are tedious tasks or long
waits: Watching the old lady in front of you pay for her groceries one
nickel at a time can be just as excruciating as 4 broken ribs,
especially if you're in a hurry.

To get a computer to do something, you (or someone else) have to tell
it exactly — in excruciating detail — what to do.
* Slack :Duke:
[2019-11-10 Sun 10:06]

If you slow down at the end of a race, you slack off. When you use
slack this way, it means to reduce your speed, to be sluggish, or to
be negligent.

If something is loose, it's also said to be slack. A clothesline, for
example, is slack if it is just hanging loosely between two trees. If
you pull the clothesline tight, you reduce the slack. The root word of
slack is the Old English word slæc, which means "loose or careless."
When you scold your friend for being careless about his
responsibilities, you can say, "Pick up the slack!"

Packing and Slack
