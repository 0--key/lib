* coarse :Duke:
[2019-10-29 Tue 11:32]

Coarse can mean rough to the touch or vulgar. It's good to have coarse
sand paper, but not good to have coarse manners.

Do you lick your dinner plate, wipe your nose on your sleeve, and
generally behave like an oaf? No, of course not. You're the kind of
person who reads online dictionaries. But if you did do any of things,
you'd be coarse — that is, unrefined, boorish, and downright vulgar.
Coarse can apply to a wide variety of things other than behavior. If
something is of poor quality, cheap and inferior, it's considered
coarse.

Therefore, the “parts” of
this book provide only a coarse classification of topics.
* hype :Duke:
[2019-10-30 Wed 16:53]

As a noun, hype means extravagant claims about a person or product.
All the hype about a miraculous new kind of mop might influence you to
buy one, but after trying it out you'll realize it's just a mop.

Experts speculate that the word hype may be a back formation of
hyperbole, or it may come from hyper — old-fashioned slang for a
person who swindled someone. As a verb, to hype something is to
blatantly promote it. If you hype your favorite restaurant enough,
your friends will finally try it. If they all hate it, though, they
might never listen to you again!

In our presentation, we aim for
professionalism rather than cuteness, and we’d rather
understate a point than hype it.
* riveting :Duke:
[2019-10-30 Wed 17:01]

A rivet is a fastener that holds something closed or down, and
something riveting keeps you glued to your seat and grabs your
attention. Sometimes a movie is so riveting that not even free popcorn
refills can lure you away.

Riveting is an adjective for things that really draw you in, like a
book you read in one sitting or a song you turn up so you can hear
every lyric. Beautiful scenes are riveting, but terrible and ugly
things are also riveting, like the site of an accident you can't stop
looking at. Words from a teacher or actor have a riveting effect when
they're full of impact and interest, and when you exaggerate a story
for your best friend, that's riveting too.

If you pass a Try this without trying – maybe
because you are not near a computer or you find the text
riveting — do return to it when you do the chapter drill; a
Try this either complements the chapter drill or is a part
of it.

This allows us
to be economical with space (and your time) and also to
emphasize that programming is more than simply slinging
code together to get a result as quickly as possible.
* worthwhile :Duke:
[2019-11-04 Mon 09:26]

Things that are worthwhile are good — they're worth the time or money
you spend on them.

If you walked out of the theater and said "Wow, I'm glad I saw that
movie!", then your film viewing trip was worthwhile. If going to the
gym helped you get in better shape, it was worthwhile. If hanging out
in the park made you happy, it was worthwhile. If something is a total
waste of time and you wish you hadn't done it, then it wasn't
worthwhile.

In this chapter, we lift our eyes from
the technical details and consider the big picture: Why is
programming a worthwhile activity?
* stitch :Duke:
[2019-11-04 Mon 09:33]

When a needle pulls thread through fabric and into a loop, that's a
stitch. Every quilt, no matter how elaborate, starts with a single
stitch.

You can stitch a design on a pillow, or stitch up a hole in your jeans
using stitches. Doctors sometimes stitch up patients' skin, too — if
you cut yourself badly enough, you might need stitches. Another kind
of stitch is a painful cramp in your stomach or side: "I stopped
running when I got a stitch." If someone says, "I haven't got a stitch
to wear," they're short on clothing. And being "in stitches" means
laughing uncontrollably.

The management of the
distribution networks is of course computerized, as are the
communication systems that stitch them all together.
* utensils :Duke:
[2019-11-04 Mon 09:37]

A utensil is a tool you can hold in your hand and use around the
house. In the kitchen, common utensils are the knives, forks, and
spoons that we hold in our hands and use to eat.

The word utensil comes from the Latin utensilia meaning "things for
use." A pen is a writing utensil. A spatula is a cooking utensil. A
scrub brush is a cleaning utensil. A knife is a cutting utensil. All
of these objects can be held in your hand and are used to get
something done.

The superior quality of
modern photographic lenses and the exquisite shapes in
the design of modern everyday gadgets and utensils owe
almost everything to computer-based design and
production methods.
* exaggeration :Duke:
[2019-11-05 Tue 12:51]

If you're prone to exaggeration, it means you habitually overstate the
truth. If you have a dog and a hamster, it would be an exaggeration to
describe yourself as "practically Doctor Dolittle," living in a house
full of animals.

When you make something showier, or more noticeable than normal,
that's also called exaggeration. The exaggeration of your hand
movements might be necessary on stage so the audience can see them,
but in real life it just looks silly. Exaggeration comes from the
Latin word exaggerare, which means to magnify or to heap or pile on.

That may be an exaggeration, but there is something
to the idea of looking at a simple artifact and thinking
about what it implies.
* nitpicking :Duke:
[2019-11-05 Tue 14:16]

When you nitpick, you focus on small, specific mistakes. An English
teacher might nitpick by pointing out an unnecessary comma in your
otherwise perfect 20-page paper.

People who nitpick are bothered by minor problems — or else they're
just looking for something to criticize. A movie critic who dislikes a
director might nitpick about her latest film's slight inaccuracies.
Your mom might nitpick about your outfit, saying, "It's a shame your
socks don't quite match." Nitpick was first used in 1962, and
nitpicker came first, from the idea that nitpickers search for faults
the way they might pick nits, or lice eggs, from someone's hair.

We want “the machine” to do things
that are difficult enough for us to want help with them, but
computers are nitpicking, unforgiving, dumb beasts.
* hitherto :Duke:
[2019-11-05 Tue 14:20]

Use the adverb hitherto when you're describing a state or circumstance
that existed up until now. If you find a hitherto undiscovered hidden
tunnel in your cellar, you're the first to discover it.

When some particular situation has existed so far, up until the moment
that you're speaking of, you can use the word hitherto to talk about
it. You could say that you're taking a hot air balloon ride that you
were hitherto too scared to contemplate, or that a very shy girl in
your philosophy class who was hitherto totally silent finally spoke up
today and asked a very intelligent question.

We typically start
with analysis, but feedback from testing can help improve the
programming; problems with getting the program working may indicate a
problem with the design; and working with the design may suggest
aspects of the problem that hitherto had been overlooked in the
analysis.
* permeates :Duke:
[2019-11-05 Tue 14:34]

When you live in a big city like New York, you know all too well how
the smells of spices and cooking meats can permeate a hallway, easily
passing through those thin apartment doors to make your mouth water.

The verb permeate literally means to "pass through." It's often used
to describe smells or liquids that not only pass through, but also
spread to fill an entire area. When you bake cookies, you'll notice
that the rich, sweet smell of those cookies isn't confined just to
your oven — it permeates the entire kitchen and even the whole house.
In science class, you might have learned about a permeable membrane —
a thin material that is porous enough to let liquids or gases to pass
through.

We are obviously in awe of the range of software that permeates our
technological civilization.
* excruciating :Duke:
[2019-11-05 Tue 17:30]

Something that’s really intense or painful is excruciating. If you go
skiing and break your leg in several places, the ride from the slope
to the hospital will be excruciating — unless you're unconscious, too.

Excruciating doesn't just hurt. It feels like torture. This adjective
actually comes to us from the Latin excruciatus, which means “to
afflict, harass, vex, torment.” Extremely painful injuries are
certainly excruciating, but sometimes so are tedious tasks or long
waits: Watching the old lady in front of you pay for her groceries one
nickel at a time can be just as excruciating as 4 broken ribs,
especially if you're in a hurry.

To get a computer to do something, you (or someone else) have to tell
it exactly — in excruciating detail — what to do.
* Slack :Duke:
[2019-11-10 Sun 10:06]

If you slow down at the end of a race, you slack off. When you use
slack this way, it means to reduce your speed, to be sluggish, or to
be negligent.

If something is loose, it's also said to be slack. A clothesline, for
example, is slack if it is just hanging loosely between two trees. If
you pull the clothesline tight, you reduce the slack. The root word of
slack is the Old English word slæc, which means "loose or careless."
When you scold your friend for being careless about his
responsibilities, you can say, "Pick up the slack!"

Packing and Slack
* grumbling :misc:
[2019-11-10 Sun 10:16]

His in-box was swelling with messages that needed his
attention.
* tardy :misc:
[2019-11-10 Sun 10:17]

When you're tardy, you're late. If you've ever been late for school,
you know about tardy, and you may have a stash of notes your teacher
has sent home to your parents, informing them of your tardiness.

You may be tardy for an appointment because you got stuck in traffic,
or maybe you just slept late and you don't have good time management
skills. Whatever the excuse, being tardy almost always annoys
whoever's waiting for you. As a reality TV star once crooned, "Don't
be tardy for the party." The word comes from the Latin tardus, meaning
"slow."

A
project had taken a wrong direction because of a tardy e-mail
response; getting it back on track meant yet more work.
* toppling :misc:
[2019-11-10 Sun 10:18]

To topple something is to knock it down. A house of cards can be
toppled — so can a government.

Things can topple in several ways. If a building collapses or falls
down for any reason, it topples. If you knocked over another student,
you toppled that person. Governments that are overthrown are also said
to be toppled. When you see the word topple, someone or something is
going down.

The
past-due pile of life was growing dangerously close to
toppling.
* stem :misc:
[2019-11-12 Tue 13:53]

A stem is a plant's stalk, and it's also a verb meaning "grow out of."
So roses have stems, and your idea to give roses to your mom for her
birthday stems from her love of flowers.

A stem can be the central root of a word, the supporting structure of
a plant, or the thin, cylindrical part of a glass goblet. When one
thing stems from something else, it originates or begins growing
there: "His vegetarianism stems from his love of animals." An older
meaning of the verb is "stop the flow of something," as in "Stem your
nosebleed with this tissue!" or "Some people think streetlights will
stem the graffiti on that street."

He would first stem the tide.
* austerity :misc:
[2019-11-12 Tue 13:54]

If you've ever had a teacher who was particularly stern and strict,
you might have (quietly) remarked on his austerity. When you're
talking about the character of a person, austerity means "sternness
and severity."

Austerity's original meaning, taken from the Greek word austeros, was
"bitter or harsh taste." While it's rarely used that way anymore, it's
still a great description of the word's current meanings. As well as
describing a personal quality of sternness, it also means "a simple,
plain manner" and "an extreme frugality." So you could talk about the
austerity of a very plainly decorated room or the austerity you're
forced to live with ever since your parents stopped giving you a
weekly allowance. If your lack of money had a taste, it might very
well be "bitter or harsh."

Eventually, this austerity would pay off.
* shrink :misc:
[2019-11-12 Tue 13:55]

Shrink is the informal word you can use to talk about a therapist.
Talking about your problems with her can hopefully help you shrink
them, or make them smaller.

The word shrink is related to the Swedish skrynka meaning "to
wrinkle." Think about what happens to a lone forgotten fruit at the
bottom of your fridge drawer. After a while, it begins to wrinkle or
shrink. Clothes washed in hot water tend to shrink, so be wary of the
setting on your washing machine. The use of shrink as referring to
therapists started as late as the 1960s — with the idea of a
psychologist being a "head-shrinker."

The to-do
pile would shrink to a manageable level.
* coveted :misc:
[2019-11-12 Tue 14:00]

Coveted means "in demand" or "desired." If the most coveted seat on
the bus for you is the one right next to the bathroom, then you
shouldn’t have any problem getting it because most people don't want
it.

Coveted comes from the Latin cupiditas, meaning “passionate desire,
eagerness, ambition.” Cupid isn't always involved, though — coveted is
another way of saying "sought after." The poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox
said, “If you are seeking health, wealth, usefulness, skill in any
direction, there is nothing and no one who can hinder your attainment
of the coveted boon, if you are willing to work and wait." So get to
work for all that coveted health and wealth!

A leather jacket he had
coveted went on sale at a great price.
* aspirations :misc:
[2019-11-12 Tue 14:03]

If your aspiration, or ambition, is to climb Mt. Everest someday, you
better start training, because it’s a long, hard climb that requires a
lot of preparation.

Aspiration means "inhalation" or "breathing." So how did it come to
mean "ambition" or "the will to succeed"? The Latin gives us a clue:
spirare ("to breathe") and spiritus ("spirit"). It was once believed
that our breath was our soul or spirit, which might explain why we
talk about "breathing life into" something, or coming up with energy
and ideas to invigorate it. How else to breathe life into something
than with ambition and drive, in other words, "spirit"?

Even aspirations can differ.
* perpetually :misc:
[2019-11-12 Tue 17:08]

Use the adverb perpetually if something is never, ever going to stop
doing what it's doing, like your perpetually chattering cousin.

Perpetually comes from the adjective perpetual, which comes from the
Latin for "never stopping." Although there might be some things that
might exist perpetually, like the universe (hopefully), we usually use
perpetually for things that just feel like they're never going to end.
If the coffee shop you go to is perpetually playing the same album,
bring them a new one. A good synonym is incessantly.

Unlike the sudden and possibly fleeting
tightening of one’s budget due to job loss, poverty means
a perpetually tight budget.
* sated :misc:
[2019-11-12 Tue 17:18]

Sometimes you're so hungry you feel like you could eat a ten-course
meal. Other times it takes just a small salad to sate your appetite,
or to satisfy your hunger.

The verb sate comes from the Old English sadian, “to satiate,” and can
be applied to any situation regarding the satisfaction of a need or an
appetite. If you have been craving something sweet, your craving might
be sated by a bag of jellybeans. However, if it seems like you can
never get enough jellybeans, your appetite for sweets might be
described as insatiable, a word used to describe a person or entity
whose appetites — literally or figuratively — are impossible to
satisfy.

So half were hungry and half were sated.
* infer :misc:
[2019-11-12 Tue 17:22]

When you infer something, you read between the lines. To infer is to
make a well informed guess — if you see your mom’s bag on the table,
you might infer that she’s home.

When you infer, you listen closely to someone and guess at things they
mean but haven't actually said. It’s like guessing, but not making
wild guesses. You're making deductions — guesses based on logic.
Another kind of inferring is more scientific, like when a scientist
has part of a dinosaur fossil and can infer what the rest of the
dinosaur looked like. When you see the word infer, think "educated
guess."

Here we do not rely on odd behaviors such as
leafing through cookbooks or making plans to be a
restaurateur to infer their fixation.
* visceral :misc:
[2019-11-12 Tue 17:26]

When something's visceral, you feel it in your guts. A visceral
feeling is intuitive — there might not be a rational explanation, but
you feel that you know what's best, like your visceral reaction
against egg salad.

Your hatred of mice may not be rational, but it is visceral, and every
time you see one, you feel like you're going to faint. And when you
had to decide whether you were going to stay in Florida or move to
Texas, even though you had a good job in Orlando you had a visceral
feeling that Texas would be the right choice . . . and it turned out
you were meant to be a rancher! Visceral can also mean “relating to
the viscera,” with viscera being your organs.

Other,
less visceral forms of scarcity also capture the mind.
* repercussions :misc:
[2019-11-13 Wed 20:42]

A repercussion is something that happens because of another action.
You could quit paying your rent, but getting evicted from your
apartment might be the repercussion.

Repercussion may remind you slightly of concussion or percussion —
what they all have in common is the idea of something (a head, a drum)
getting hit. With repercussion, the hitting is the action, and the
result (i.e., the repercussion) is like hearing an echo of that
original strike over and over as it reverberates through the air.

And it can have
repercussions, for example, on health, safety, or
education.
* rave :misc:
[2019-11-19 Tue 21:31]

If you rave about a book you just read, you're telling people you
think it's great, or you're giving it a rave review.

Rave has two levels, one that implies you're very excited about
something and the other that you are too excited, so you seem crazy.
While raving about a movie means to talk it up, being a raving lunatic
means you are engaging in a lot of crazy talk. When you rave about a
performance, you talk enthusiastically about it. Take that
enthusiastic talking to the next level, and you might be called raving
in the crazy sense.

They
were right to rave.

It's why someone who has gone bonkers doesn't need any
introduction.
* drip :misc:
[2019-11-29 Fri 18:11]

When water flows slowly in tiny drops, it drips. The movement of water
in this way is called a drip.

Have you ever had a leaky faucet? Then you probably know a drip is
water leaking out one drop at a time: drip drip drip. A broken faucet
has a drip, and you can say the water is dripping. When it rains, it
usually starts dripping before it rains harder. When you turn on the
shower, it might start as drips. Once the water is flowing strongly
and in a stream, it's not dripping anymore.

It died in a drip and a gurgle.
* bovinely :misc:
[2019-11-30 Sat 23:41]

If something is bovine, it has to do with cows or cattle, or it
reminds you of the slow and seemingly unintelligent ways of cows and
cattle. Someone's glacial pace and dull comments might contribute to
his thoroughly bovine impression.

The adjective bovine is used for anything that has to do with animals
from the genus “Bos,” which classifies wild and domestic cattle. Mad
Cow Disease is technically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
and it can be said to have bovine origins. What are known as cow pies
are, in fact, bovine droppings. People can be described as bovine if
they are intellectually dull, slow-moving, or somewhat cow-like in
their appearance.

She looked around bovinely.
* shriek :misc:
[2019-11-30 Sat 23:42]

A high-pitched, piercing cry is a shriek. A common response to finding
a snake curled in the silverware drawer would be to shriek.

You can shriek in fear, surprise, or even shriek with laughter. If the
sound you make is high, sharp, and loud, it's a shriek. A teenager who
sees her favorite movie star might shriek, "Look who it is!" And,
little kids in an inflatable bouncy house will very likely shriek with
delight. The word shriek sounds very much like what it means, and its
Old Norse root skrækja, "to screech," may have originated for that
very reason.

Ruth Gogan
suddenly shouted with cryptic glee, and then
burst into a shriek of laughter.
* bewilderment :misc:
[2019-11-30 Sat 23:44]

If you spoke nothing but German one day to your English-speaking
friends and co-workers, it would probably result in complete
bewilderment. Bewilderment is a state of being confused and puzzled.

Bewilderment means not understanding, but it goes beyond that — it
implies a state of complete mystification. People experience
bewilderment when they are utterly baffled by the situation at hand.
The word is a relatively new one, first recorded in the 1680s as a
combination of be, "thoroughly," and wilder, "lead astray or lure into
the wilds." You can think of bewilderment as being led into the
wilderness and left to puzzle your way out.

Carrie still blinked
around at her classmates in slow bewilderment.
