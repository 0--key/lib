An objective is something you plan to achieve. A military objective is
the overall plan for a mission. The objective for a bake sale is to
raise money. If your objective is to learn a new word, you have
succeeded.

An objective is the point of something. If you don’t understand the
objective of a class, then you don’t know what you were supposed to
learn. The word itself is often used in business or work. Another
meaning of objective is “looking at things in a detached, impartial,
fact-based way.” If a police officer falls in love with a witness, it
might be hard for her to stay objective. The word comes from the Latin
ob "against" + jacere "to throw.”

We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all
different and yet the same.
