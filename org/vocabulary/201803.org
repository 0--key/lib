* tidy :satellite:
[2018-02-22 Thu 14:03]

Use the adjective tidy for something that is neat and clean. If your
desk were more tidy, you would be able to find your computer.

Tidy (or tidy up) also means “to clean up” and is also a noun for a
container for small objects, like scraps or sewing materials. These
senses of tidy have a formal or even old-fashioned note. (We’re more
likely to say clean, organize, or bin now in everyday conversation.) A
less informal use is as an adjective, meaning “large.” If you can put
the word tidy before your profit or the sum in your bank account, it’s
a good thing.

on creating an environment for effectiveness refer
to such matters as having a tidy office or home for unleashing
creativity, and the need to protect "prime time".

* credentials :satellite:
[2018-03-10 Sat 11:41]

Credentials offer proof of a fact, or of qualifications. A driver’s
license, a doctor’s badge, or a diploma all count as credentials — as
long as they’re real!

One document can be a credential, but the word usually still gets
pluralized. Credentials prove that the bearer has gotten credit for
what he or she has done, as with a transcript, diploma, or certificate
proving a person’s activities. Your credentials allow you to get the
job, but your skills are what make you good at your job. Credentials
can also prove that you are allowed to do something or go somewhere,
like a badge that gets you past security.

Before having her tonsils removed, Jahi McMath, a thirteen-year-old
African-American girl from Oakland, California, asked her doctor,
Frederick Rosen, about his credentials.
* slumber :satellite:
[2018-03-10 Sat 11:43]

Slumber means "sleep" — as a verb or noun. If you're a sound sleeper,
you might slumber peacefully right through a thunderstorm, your
slumber undisturbed.

To slumber is to sleep, sometimes specifically to sleep lightly or
doze. You can slumber in your bed, in your airplane seat, or through
your alarm in the morning. Slumber can also describe a peacefulness,
like your quiet street that seems to slumber early in the morning. The
phrase slumber party was first used in the 1940s to mean a gathering
held at night, that usually involves very little slumbering.

She snored so
loudly that she was too embarrassed to go to slumber parties.
* chunky :satellite:
[2018-03-10 Sat 11:47]

Something that's full of little lumps and bits is chunky. Some people
are crazy about chunky peanut butter, while others prefer it to be
smooth and creamy.

Some kinds of soup are chunky, with hunks of potato and pieces of
broccoli, and you can also make a chunky spaghetti sauce that's full
of tomato bits. When a person is described as chunky, it means they're
dense and thick-bodied, and sometimes quite muscular. Chunky is an
American English word, from the sense of chunk as "a thick piece of
something,"

Her classmates made
fun of her for being “chunky,” and she absorbed the insults without
protest.
* soothe :satellite:
[2018-03-10 Sat 11:49]

To soothe is to relieve or to bring comfort. If the pounding in your
head is driving you mad, it sounds like you might need an aspirin or
two to soothe your headache.

Soothing is meant to make you feel better, both physically and
emotionally. Spend too many hours on the beach without sunblock?
You'll need some aloe to soothe that sunburn. Had a bad breakup with a
boyfriend? Soothing that broken heart might take something stronger —
chocolates, a gabfest with good friends, and sappy movies are usually
just what the doctor ordered.

on December 9, 2013, the nurses gave her a
grape Popsicle to soothe her throat.
* digression :satellite:
[2018-03-11 Sun 11:18]

When your essay about French cooking starts describing a childhood
trip to Disneyland, it's taken a digression — it's strayed from the
main topic.

"But I digress" is a phrase often used by people when they realize
they're no longer "on-topic." A digression is like a tangent, only
digression often describes speech patterns, whereas tangent comes to
us from mathematics. Another trick to remembering the meaning of
digression is its relationship to the word progression. A progression
is a series of ideas which proceeds in the same direction; a
digression, logically enough, is an idea that goes off in another
direction.

I apologize for this digression but let's take a moment to talk
about one of your past sponsors, namely Datadog.
* pageant                                                         :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:37]

A pageant is an elaborate show or parade that usually depicts a
historical or religious event, although these days more people know
them as Miss America-type beauty contests.

Pageants aren't just for beauty queens — any richly decorated
spectacle or ceremony could be considered a pageant. Around Christmas
time, many Christian churches put on pageants that reenact the birth
of Jesus. The Carnival parades in Brazil represent another type of
pageant. And if your school organized a show where students had to act
out famous moments in history? That would be a pageant, too.

The Pageant of Fireflies
* spurt :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:40]

Things that spurt gush, stream, or flow rapidly. If you laugh too hard
while drinking a Coke, soda might spurt out of your nose. Ouch!

Spurt is also a noun: "A spurt of water erupted from the hole in the
water balloon before she had a chance to throw it." Though a jet of
liquid is usually what spurts, the word is also used for quick bursts
of speed, like a race car that spurts forward suddenly, winning at the
last second. The origin of spurt isn't certain, but it may be related
to the German spürzen, "to spit" and sprützen, "to squirt."

In the fields the maize
was starting to fill out, the silken tassels turning from brown to butter-blond; when
you tore off the wrapping of leaves and bit into the rows of pearly seeds the juice
would spurt into your mouth like milk.
* salvo :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:42]

A salvo is when troops fire their guns all at the same time. A salvo
of shots might signal the beginning of a military battle.

Another word for the gunfire kind of salvo is a "volley." Military
planners have used salvos as a way to overwhelm an opposing army,
including during engagements between battleships and tanks. You can
also use salvo in a more figurative way, describing a verbal barrage
or attack: "Her direct, almost rude questions were seen as the opening
salvo in the battle between the two political candidates."

Up on the hills, among the dark cypress and the heather, shoals of butterflies danced
and twisted like wind-blown confetti, pausing now and then on a leaf to lay a salvo of
eggs.
* lank :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:43]

Lank can describe grass that is long, hair that is limp, and people
who are tall and thin.

From the Old English hlanc (which is fun to say out loud), meaning
loose and empty, lank is an adjective used to describe plant life
which is long and slender, hair that hangs long and limp, and people
who are long and slim. So you might hire a lank basketball player with
lank hair to cut the grass when it’s lank. Or you might cut it
yourself.

They were
lank and green, with chinless faces and monstrous globular eyes, frosty gold, with an
expression of intense, predatory madness in them.
* mauve :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:45]

Mauve is a paler tone of the color purple, and for some strange reason
a beloved color for mothers of the bride.

Mauve is often considered a somewhat wishy-washy color, inoffensive
and bland. After all, the American novelist Alice Walker didn't
entitle her great 1982 novel about black women's' lives in the
American South The Color Mauve; she called it The Color Purple — far
more suggestive of the powerful, violence-soaked drama it is.

When
the sun sank there was a brief, apple-green twilight which faded and became mauve, and
the air cooled and took on the scents of evening.
* gauze :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:46]

Gauze is a loosely woven, almost translucent fabric that's used to
bandage wounds. If you get a bad burn, a doctor might clean it and
cover it with gauze.

In medicine, gauze has several uses. Sterile gauze is usually kept in
a sealed package, to ensure that it's perfectly clean. It can be used
to clean cuts, scrapes, and burns, and also acts as a large bandage.
There is also a non-medical fabric called gauze that's used in light,
warm-weather clothing. The word's origin is mysterious — one guess
traces it to the Arabic gazz, or "raw silk."

They hopped furtively
among the long grass clumps in the olive-groves, where the crane-flies' unsteady flight
seemed to cover the ground with a drifting curtain of gauze.
* trifle :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:46]

A trifle is something that's totally unimportant. If your friend is
freaking out over which poster to buy and you call her dilemma a
trifle, you're saying she shouldn't get so worked up over nothing.

Trifle comes from the Middle English trufle, meaning "fraud, joke,
trick." You'll usually hear it used to mean "insignificant, trivial."
If you write a little ditty to sing at a birthday party, you could say
it's just a trifle. As a verb, trifle means "toy with, waste." If you
play with someone's feelings without seriously meaning anything, you
are trifling with his affection. Trifle is also a sweet, sticky cake.
Don't trifle the day away dreaming about trifle. Make some!

They sat there blinking,
and then would suddenly snap at a passing crane-fly; sitting back, looking a trifle
embarrassed, they stuffed the trailing ends of wing and leg into their great mouths with
the aid of their thumbs.
* soot :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:48]

The powdery black stuff that's sometimes created when fuel burns is
called soot. A chimney sweep's job is to clean all the soot and ash
from inside a chimney.

Soot is mostly made of carbon, and it forms when matter burns
incompletely. Engines, burning coal, and house fires are all sources
of soot, and soot is a major contributor to air pollution around the
world. It's dangerous for people to breathe too much soot into their
lungs. Soot comes from a Germanic root that literally means "what
settles."

The owls appeared now, drifting from tree to tree as silently as flakes of soot,
hooting in astonishment as the moon rose higher and higher, turning to pink, then gold,
and finally riding in a nest of stars, like a silver bubble.
* interminable :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:50]

Use interminable to describe something that has or seems to have no
end. Your math class. Your sister's violin recital. A babysitting job
where five kids are going through your purse and the parents didn't
leave a number.

Something that is interminable is often boring, annoying, or hard to
bear, such as an interminable noise. A near synonym is incessant,
which also refers to something unpleasant that continues without
stopping. It descends from the Latin prefix in- "not," terminare "to
end," and the suffix -abilis "able to." Latin terminare is also the
source of the English verb terminate "to end" and the corresponding
noun termination "an act of ending something."

At first the lessons were painful to an extreme: interminable
wrestling with fractions and percentages, geological strata and warm currents, nouns,
verbs, and adverbs.
* extricating :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:55]

If you need to be untangled, set free or otherwise released from
something or someone, you need to be extricated.

Extricate is a mixture of the prefix ex, which means "out" or "out
of," and the Latin word tricae, which means "hindrances." So to
extricate is to get out of what's hindering you. But it's not always
so simple. You just try and extricate yourself from the loving death
grip of a grandma who hasn't seen you in awhile!

Sometimes these
climaxes were so complicated and fraught with danger that I had great difficulty in
extricating the family intact on the following day.
* protruding :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:55]

Something protruding is sticking out. When you're playing hide and
seek, be sure your whole body is under the bed — a protruding arm or
leg will give away your hiding spot.

The part sticking out of an otherwise flat surface can be described as
protruding. If a display is protruding from a storefront, you have to
walk around it. If you have a big, red zit protruding from your
forehead, you should probably see a dermatologist. And if you look up
the mountainside and see rocks protruding, look out! Protruding rocks
tend to fall down, which could put a damper on the hike.

While I was at work on my
masterpiece, breathing heavily, tongue protruding, breaking off for discussions with
Roger on the finer points of the plot, Peter and Margo would take a stroll in the sunken
garden to look at the flowers.
* conscience :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:56]

A conscience is a built-in sense of what's right and what's wrong.
That sick feeling in your stomach after you meanly told your younger
brother the truth about Santa Claus? That might be your conscience
bothering you.

The word conscience contains the word science, which comes from the
Latin word scientia, meaning "to know" or "knowledge." You can think
of your conscience as your knowledge of yourself, especially when it
comes to your own morals, or your feelings about right and wrong.
Pangs of conscience, which feel like an uncomfortable inner voice, are
helpful when you're trying to decide the right thing to do in a
particular situation.

Occasionally, in the early days, Peter suffered from sudden spasms of conscience, my
epic would be relegated to a drawer, and we would pore over mathematical problems.
* relegated :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:57]

Relegate means assign to a lower position. If the quarterback of the
football team stops making decent throws he might be relegated to the
position of benchwarmer, while another kid is given the chance to
play.

Relegate rhymes with delegate––both words derive from the Latin legare
"send." Relegate means to send someone down in rank. Delegate means to
send someone in your place to complete a task. In the workplace,
managers who can't figure out how to delegate may get relegated to a
lesser rank.

Occasionally, in the early days, Peter suffered from sudden spasms of conscience, my
epic would be relegated to a drawer, and we would pore over mathematical problems.
* pore :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:57]

That trickle of sweat didn't just miraculously appear — it was
secreted out of a pore, a really tiny opening on the surface of your
skin.

When used as a noun, pore means any tiny hole or opening that allows
the passage of liquid. In humans, pores are the little holes that
bring us such pleasures as armpit sweat and, when clogged, pimples.
But when used as a verb, to pore means to concentrate your attention
on or devote hours of focus to something: like poring over the
overwhelming choices in the antiperspirant aisle.

Occasionally, in the early days, Peter suffered from sudden spasms of conscience, my
epic would be relegated to a drawer, and we would pore over mathematical problems.
* slab :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 15:00]

A slab is a great big thick piece of something. Your backyard patio,
for example, might be made of a huge slab of concrete.

A sidewalk is often composed of one cement slab after another — these
are sometimes called paving slabs. You could refer to large pieces of
stone or wood as slabs too. Even your lunch might be a slab, if it's a
thick hunk of cheesy pizza or a huge slab of bread slathered with
peanut butter. The origins of the word slab are unknown, though we do
know it's been around since the thirteenth century.

The walls were sparsely, but tastefully, decorated with a slab slate
containing the fossilized remains of a fish, a photograph of myself shaking hands with a
chimpanzee, and a stuffed bat.
* slate :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 15:01]

Slate is a type of gray metamorphic rock that is made up of quartz and
other minerals. The rock can be split into thin layers and the slate
used for things like roofing tiles.

In the past when paper was expensive, schoolchildren used slates to do
their school work. These were usually made of actual slate rock.
Students could practice their writing on the slate with a slate
pencil. When they were done, the slate could be erased, which gave
rise to the term "clean slate." If you've done things in the past you
aren't proud of, you may hope to start over with a clean slate.

The walls were sparsely, but tastefully, decorated with a slab slate
containing the fossilized remains of a fish, a photograph of myself
shaking hands with a chimpanzee, and a stuffed bat.

* freckled :satellite:
[2018-03-15 Thu 09:33]

If you have freckles scattered across your nose, you can call yourself
freckled. It's pretty common for people with red hair to be freckled.

Freckles are tiny concentrated spots of color on the skin, and someone
who has them on her body is freckled. You might appear more freckled
after spending time in the sun — or you may just be naturally freckled
no matter how little sun you get. The number of freckles you have is
genetic: if your mom and grandma are freckled, chances are you will
be, too.

On the vines the grapes hung in tiny
clusters, freckled and warm.
* weighed :satellite:
[2018-03-15 Thu 09:34]

To weigh is all about judging; you could be seeing how heavy something
is or if it is a good choice. You could weigh the tomatoes you're
buying or weigh your options when applying to college.

To weigh something can mean to physically assess its weight — is it 3
pounds? 40 kilos? 22 grams? But it's no accident that the symbol for
justice is often a scale. That's because all of the facts of a case
need to be weighed or evaluated for justice to be served. And
hopefully the decision will be balanced and fair.

The olives seemed weighed down under the
weight of their fruit, smooth drops of green jade among which the choirs
of cicadas zithered.
* supplication :satellite:
[2018-03-15 Thu 09:37]

Think of a supplication as sort of a prayer, a request for help from a
deity. The word carries a sense of awe and adoration with it,
suggesting something tentative, even servile, a respectful appeal to a
higher power.

Although it is a noun, supplication comes from the Latin verb
supplicare, which means "to plead humbly." While a supplication is
often thought of as a religious prayer (it is used 60 times in the
Bible), it can logically be applied to any situation in which you must
entreat someone in power for help or a favor. Still, it carries with
it an aura of religiosity and deep entreaty, and should not be used to
describe just any simple request.

The crooked arms, with their fringes of sharp teeth, would be
raised in mock supplication to the insect world, so humble, so fervent,
trembling slightly when a butterfly flew too close.

With bulging eyes staring as though
hypnotized, their backs as shiny as the leaves they sat amongst, they
swelled out their vocal sacs and croaked harshly and with such violence
that they seemed in danger of splitting their damp bodies with the
effort.
* furtively :satellite:
[2018-03-15 Thu 09:39]

The adverb furtively is great for describing the movements or behavior
of someone who's being sneaky or sly. Kids decorating their neighbor's
trees with toilet paper on Halloween tend to sneak furtively around
the yard.

If you do something furtively, you don't want anyone to notice you;
you're keeping a low profile. Usually, a person acting furtively feels
guilty, or knows they're in danger of getting in trouble or being
embarrassed. Furtively comes from the Latin word for "theft," fur. You
can think of furtively as meaning "acting like a thief." Even though
not everyone who behaves furtively is a thief, you might think they
are, seeing them sneak away.

They hopped furtively among the
long grass clumps in the olive-groves, where the crane-flies' unsteady
flight seemed to cover the ground with a drifting curtain of gauze.
