  [Tidy] (or [tidy] up) also means “to clean up” and is also a noun for a
  container for small objects, like scraps or sewing materials. These
  senses of [tidy] have a formal or even old-fashioned note. (We’re more
  likely to say clean, organize, or bin now in everyday conversation.)
  A less informal use is as an adjective, meaning “large.” If you can
  put the word [tidy] before your profit or the sum in your bank
  account, it’s a good thing.

  "But I digress" is a phrase often used by people when they realize
  they're no longer "on-topic." A [digression] is like a tangent, only
  [digression] often describes speech patterns, whereas tangent comes to
  us from mathematics. Another trick to remembering the meaning of
  [digression] is its relationship to the word progression. A
  progression is a series of ideas which proceeds in the same
  direction; a [digression], logically enough, is an idea that goes off
  in another direction.

  [Mauve] is often considered a somewhat wishy-washy color, inoffensive
  and bland. After all, the American novelist Alice Walker didn't

  more suggestive of the powerful, violence-soaked drama it is.

  bear, such as an [interminable] noise. A near synonym is incessant,
  which also refers to something unpleasant that continues without
  stopping. It descends from the Latin prefix in- "not," terminare "to
  end," and the suffix -abilis "able to." Latin terminare is also the
  source of the English verb terminate "to end" and the corresponding
  noun termination "an act of ending something."

  [Extricate] is a mixture of the prefix ex, which means "out" or "out
  of," and the Latin word tricae, which means "hindrances." So to

  so simple. You just try and [extricate] yourself from the loving death
  grip of a grandma who hasn't seen you in awhile!

  A sidewalk is often composed of one cement [slab] after another —
  these are sometimes called paving [slab]s. You could refer to large

  noun
   1. мольба (pleading, plea, supplication, prayer, entreaty, cry)

  DEFINITION

  noun
   1. the action of asking or begging for something earnestly or humbly.
      "he fell to his knees in supplication"


  Think of a [supplication] as sort of a prayer, a request for help from
  a deity. The word carries a sense of awe and adoration with it,
  suggesting something tentative, even servile, a respectful appeal to
  a higher power.

  Although it is a noun, [supplication] comes from the Latin verb
  supplicare, which means "to plead humbly." While a [supplication] is
  often thought of as a religious prayer (it is used 60 times in the
  Bible), it can logically be applied to any situation in which you
  must entreat someone in power for help or a favor. Still, it carries
  with it an aura of religiosity and deep entreaty, and should not be
  used to describe just any simple request.

  If you do something [furtively], you don't want anyone to notice you;
  you're keeping a low profile. Usually, a person acting [furtively]
  feels guilty, or knows they're in danger of getting in trouble or

  fur. You can think of [furtively] as meaning "acting like a thief."

  The noun [exuberance] comes from the adjective exuberant, which itself
  came from a Latin word that originally described an overflowing
  supply of milk from the udder of a cow or goat! The word still means
  "overflowing," not with milk but with joy and enthusiasm. After your
  winning home run, the fans ran onto the field and, in their
  [exuberance], carried you off on their shoulders . . . before you
  touched home plate.
