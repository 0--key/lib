Something tacit is implied or understood without question. Holding
hands might be a tacit acknowledgment that a boy and girl are dating.

The adjective tacit refers to information that is understood without
needing to acknowledge it. For example, since we know that the sky is
blue, that kind of assumption is tacit. Lawyers talk about "tacit
agreements," where parties give their silent consent and raise no
objections.

You need to bring it back down to earth, there needs to be some tacit
examples and some things that people can relate to everyday life.
