* impromptu :misc:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:29]

Some of the best kinds of parties are impromptu ones, when you decide
at the last minute to get together. The adjective impromptu describes
things done or said without previous thought or preparation.

Impromptu is also used as an adverb: Most people are not able to speak
impromptu in front of an audience. This word was borrowed from French
and ultimately derives from the Latin in prōmptū ("at hand, in
readiness") from in ("in") plus a form of prōmptus ("readiness"). As
you can guess from the spelling, the adjective and verb prompt are
related to impromptu; they are from the same Latin verb, prōmere, "to
bring forth."

She came scurrying over to our table,
and Monsieur X bought a dozen roses, which he handed to my
girlfriend as an impromptu gift.
* scuttling :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:37]

When you scuttle, you move with quick anxious steps, like a bug
running for cover when a light is turned on.

Use the word scuttle when you want to describe running or fast walking
that’s characterized by short, hasty steps, like someone or something
that tries to hurry — a person who is late for work scuttling through
a crowd of slow-moving pedestrians — but can't. It is also found in
these well-known lines from T.S. Eliot's poem "The Love Song of J.
Alfred Prufrock": "I should have been a pair of ragged claws /
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas."

Not a penny of aid emerged from that gruesome evening, but he went
ahead and started improvising a new plan, scuttling his dream of
theatrical glory for a more modest, workable approach.
* gruesome :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:37]

Gothic novels, horror movies, and crime dramas don't shy away from
showing gruesome scenes of death, pictures that inspire fright and
repulsion. Synonyms include "ghastly," "grisly," "loathsome," and
"macabre."

Once upon a time, English contained a variety of words related to
gruesome. The verb grue meant "to shudder," just as its Middle Dutch
source gruwen did. Grueful and grueing also conveyed the sense of
shivering with horror and disgust. All of these variations have been
lost leaving us only with gruesome. Texting while driving has caused
many gruesome accidents that you might not want to hear the gruesome
details of. Although if you like gruesome movies, you might want to
know.

Not a penny of aid emerged from that gruesome evening,
but he went ahead and started improvising a new plan, scuttling his
dream of theatrical glory for a more modest, workable approach.
* undaunted :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:38]

If you're undaunted, you're not afraid or intimidated. As a great
surfer, you remain undaunted as you seek out dangerous waters to ride
the biggest waves.

The adjective undaunted was first used in the mid-15th century to
describe horses that were "untamed, not broken in." These horses must
have seemed wildly fearless and intrepid even in the most difficult
situations. Similarly, an undaunted person remains courageous and bold
when facing fear, difficulty, and danger. Paramedics and firemen are
undaunted when faced with a burning building. You must remain
undaunted when facing your terrifying calculus homework.

A lesser man would have given up after such a defeat, but John was
undaunted.
* lesser :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:39]

Use the adjective lesser to describe something that's smaller than or
inferior to something else. A lesser singer might sound fine in the
context of a large chorus, but a solo performance could be tricky.

A young car thief might be charged with a lesser crime because of his
age — trespassing instead of larceny, for example. He's also likely to
end up with a lesser punishment in that case. Sometimes people talk
about "the lesser of two evils," by which they mean the less bad of
two bad choices, or describe something as "lesser-known," like a
rarely studied poet or an unacknowledged scientist.

A lesser man would have given up after such a defeat, but John was
undaunted.
* blurted :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:40]

If you blurt something out, you're speaking abruptly and without
thinking about what you're saying.

Usually, when you blurt something, you end up regretting it. Saying
something without considering your words can end up making you feel
stupid or hurting someone's feelings — just imagine what might happen
if you were to blurt out what you really think about your
grandmother's cooking. The best thing about the word blurt is that
it's onomatopoeic, or a word that sounds exactly like what it means.

Finally, apropos
of nothing, I blurted out some lame excuse and left.
* perfunctory :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:41]

Perfunctory means done as part of a routine or duty. If you give
someone a gift and they look at it like it's roadkill and say nothing
but a perfunctory "thank you," you might not be giving them another
one anytime soon.

A person who does something in a perfunctory way shows little
enthusiasm or interest in what they are doing. Many of our everyday
greetings are perfunctory. For example, when we say "Hello" and "How
are you?", we usually do so out of habit. Perfunctory is from Latin
perfunctus, from perfungi, "to get through with, perform," formed from
the Latin prefix per-, "completely," plus fungi, "to perform."

At the end,
after some grim, perfunctory applause, I could only think about how
to get out of there and hide.
* titter :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:41]

A titter is an awkward laugh at something that you shouldn’t be
laughing at, like during dinner when Uncle Marvin makes a joke about
your mother’s new hairstyle. If you try to hide your laugh, it’s
probably a titter.

A laugh that you can’t keep in but also can’t let out, that’s a
titter. It usually happens in situations where you shouldn’t be
laughing, like listening to your English teacher talk about a date he
went on the night before, or when someone tells you a joke in a
library. A titter is kinder than a snicker, less noticeable than a
giggle, quieter than a chuckle, and way less fun than a chortle.
Life’s a joke, laugh it up!

Lines that I had imagined were funny did
not produce the faintest titter.
* thudded :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:42]

To thud is to make the loud sound of something heavy hitting or
falling. Tip your chair too far back and your body may thud against
the floor.

Throw an egg off a balcony onto the pavement below, and it will splat,
but throw a heavy dumbbell off the same balcony and it will thud — you
can call the sound it makes a thud as well. The verb originally meant
"to strike, stab, or thrust," from the Old English imitative word
þyddan, and the noun was used to mean "blast of wind" in the early
sixteenth century.

The play
thudded forward, and from start to finish the rich people sat in
silence, utterly unmoved.
* blistering :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:42]

Use the adjective blistering to mean extremely hot. You might love
living in Georgia, except for the blistering heat in the summer time.

A baker has to remove her loaves of bread carefully from the oven
because of the blistering heat. You can also use blistering to mean a
different kind of heat: "Her blistering criticism took him by
surprise." Or a racer might set out on a track at a blistering pace,
one that's incredibly fast or impressive. The original, hot meaning of
blistering comes from the idea that something is "hot enough to form
blisters."

The alcohol had precisely
the opposite effect, and by the time the reading started, I had come
down with a massive headache, a blistering, brain-bending assault
that grew ever more unbearable as the evening wore on.
* finality :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:43]

Finality is the absolute, definite end. People often speak of the
finality of death — nothing comes after it and nothing that came
before it can be changed.

If someone speaks with absolute finality, he is not going to change
his mind. The sound of a judge's gavel slamming down gives a sense of
finality to his or her judgment. Because of its association with death
and closure, finality often carries a somber undertone. It can also be
used in conjunction with the end of a sports season. But even the
finality of the seventh game of a classic World Series is usually
forgotten by the time spring training rolls around.

He was counting on the play to
seduce them, to overwhelm their hearts and minds with such stunning
finality that they would feel no choice but to reach into their
pockets and start pulling out their checkbooks.
* overwhelm :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:43]

Overwhelm means “give a person too much of something.” If your friend
agrees to feed your pet fish while you’re on vacation, don’t overwhelm
her with requests by also asking her to do your laundry and wash the
dishes.

While it’s easy to be overwhelmed by chores or complaints, it’s also
possible to be overwhelmed by good things — if they occur in large
quantities. You might enjoy a stack of pancakes for breakfast, but
you'd probably find a truckload of pancakes overwhelming. Sometimes
people feel overwhelmed by emotion, and this can be a positive or
negative experience, depending on the emotion. For example, you might
feel overwhelmed by gratitude if your friend takes excellent care of
your fish, but overwhelmed with grief if the fish is accidentally
flushed in your absence.

He was counting on the play to
seduce them, to overwhelm their hearts and minds with such stunning
finality that they would feel no choice but to reach into their
pockets and start pulling out their checkbooks.
* indestructible :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:44]

Something that's indestructible can't be broken or destroyed. Your
indestructible winter boots last year after year, stomping through
snow and ice and salt without ever falling apart.

Things that are indestructible last for so long that it seems
impossible to break them. Your relationship with your best friend
might feel indestructible if your bond is strong and true, and your
junky old car might also seem indestructible if it never dies no
matter how many miles you drive it. The word indestructible comes from
Latin roots, the prefix in, or "not," and destruere, "tear down or
demolish" or literally "un-build."

John jumped in with his
customary excitement and energy, but things kept going wrong, and
after a while it began to seem that we weren’t putting on a play so
much as trying to prove the indestructible power of Murphy’s Law.
* customary :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:44]

Something customary is done according to practice. When a bride walks
down the aisle, it's customary for everyone at the wedding to rise out
of respect.

Every culture has its own customary traditions. In American culture
it's customary for a child who loses a tooth to put it under her
pillow and wait for the Tooth Fairy to arrive. In Greece, on the other
hand, it's customary to throw a child's lost tooth onto the roof for
good luck. Customary can also reference habitual things a person does,
like taking your shoes off when you come home, or writing in your
diary before bed.

John jumped in with his
customary excitement and energy, but things kept going wrong, and
after a while it began to seem that we weren’t putting on a play so
much as trying to prove the indestructible power of Murphy’s Law.
* spare :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:45]

Spare describes something that is extra. If you have a spare tire for
your bike you can replace a flat, and if there's enough change in your
pocket you can spare some to patch a friend's tire.

As a noun, a verb, and an adjective, the word spare has many meanings.
A leftover part is a spare, you can spare a life when you save an
animal or person, and you have spare time when you finish a project
early. If you "spare no expense" you spend lots of money and when you
spare a friend's feelings, you keep upsetting details to yourself. And
if you have a moment to spare, you have time to share.

As far as I was concerned, they were hardly more
than spare, minimalist exercises, an initial stab at something that
might or might not turn out to be real.
* surged :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:45]

A surge is a sudden strong swelling, like a tsunami wave that engulfs
the land. Although a surge offers a fluid image, anything can
experience a sudden surge, including emotions, political support, or
an angry mob.

The original Latin word surgere, meaning “to spring up or rise,”
serves as the basis for the word surge, which refers to a great sudden
growth or swelling. If you are watching a sad movie and you experience
a sudden surge of emotion, do you quietly reach for a tissue, pretend
something's in your eye, or simply weep and sob with reckless abandon?
Yeah, me too. Christmas shopping can be dangerous when there is a
surge of interest in one toy and desperate shoppers surge into stores
trying to grab it up.

The pieces had
surged up unexpectedly, and the results were quite different from
anything I had done before.
* frantic :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:46]

When a mother loses her child, she's frantic. She's a crazed sort of
agitated and goes on a frantic search for her child. A scene is
frantic if there's lots of action with little order.

Frantic is related to frenzy and both were originally ways to describe
mental illness. Hundreds of years ago, if you were frantic, you were
stark raving mad. Today, frantic implies fast wild movements or a
desperate attempt to do something. On Christmas Eve, the scene at the
mall was frantic with shoppers desperately searching for their last
few gifts. And a wild party would only be called frantic if the police
were called and everyone rushed to get away.

We weren’t flush enough to stop translating, but the
pace was less frantic now, and that allowed me to spend more time
with my own work.
* sublet :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:46]

When you rent an apartment by taking over another person's lease,
instead of renting directly from a landlord, you sublet. You can also
say the person sublets the apartment to you.

As a noun, sublet refers both to the lease agreement and to the
property itself: "I'm living in a tiny sublet right next to the train
tracks." The formal, legal word for this is sublease, but it's more
common for renters to use the informal sublet instead. Being able to
sublet to another person makes it possible for a renter to leave an
apartment without breaking their lease.

We sublet
our apartment and went to the Laurentian Mountains in Quebec, holing
up in the house of a painter friend for a couple of months while he
was away, then returned to New York for a week or two, and then
promptly packed our bags again and took a cross-country train to San
Francisco.
* stir :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:47]

To stir is to mix something up. You can literally stir cake batter
with a spoon, or figuratively stir someone's emotions by writing them
a heartfelt letter.

You can stir muffin batter with a wooden spoon, and stir in a cup of
blueberries. When people stir, they start to move after being still or
asleep: "It was only five o'clock, but he could hear the kids start to
stir." And when something stirs you, it brings up some emotion: "That
music always stirs up my sad memories." Stir shares a root with the
Old Norse styrr, "tumult or disturbance."

In the endnotes to Parenthèse 4, for
example, buried among the dry accounts of contributors’ past
achievements, he took it upon himself to declare that “Paul Auster
has created a stir in the literary world by his brilliant analysis
of the work of Laura Riding Jackson, by his essays on French
paintings, and his poetry.”
* sleeve :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:48]

The part of your clothing that covers your arm (or part of your arm)
is a sleeve. Some t-shirts have long sleeves, others have short
sleeves, and your tank top doesn't have any sleeves at all.

On a hot day, you might roll up the sleeves of your shirt, or you
might change into one with short sleeves (or no sleeves at all, also
known as sleeveless). Another kind of sleeve is a container or
protective covering, like a record sleeve or a sleeve of crackers. If
you have something "up your sleeve," it means you're hiding something
to use later in a surprising way.

This John was all enthusiasm and goodwill, a man
who had dedicated his life to beautiful things, and he wore his
heart on his sleeve.1
When I met him, he was just starting up a new magazine—“of words and
pictures”—called Parenthèse .

* mincing :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:49]

Mincing is an adjective that describes someone who is being especially
dainty or refined. The voices of older women who speak as though
they're young girls can be described as mincing.

Mincing is primarily used as an adjective meaning to be noticeably —
and perhaps oddly or unnaturally — dainty or refined. You might
remark, for example, on a lumberjack who takes mincing steps across a
log, or a woman who speaks to her dog in a mincing voice. In these
cases, the daintiness is unnatural — it's put on for show — or in the
case of the lumberjack, so he won't fall off the log.

This John, however, in that he was proudly and
flagrantly homosexual, in that he gleefully mocked himself with all
manner of mincing gestures and extravagant poses, in that he took
delight in silly jokes and ridiculous songs and a whole repertoire
of childish humor, had nothing to do with that other John.
* flagrantly :Hand:

This John, however, in that he was proudly and
flagrantly homosexual, in that he gleefully mocked himself with all
manner of mincing gestures and extravagant poses, in that he took
delight in silly jokes and ridiculous songs and a whole repertoire
of childish humor, had nothing to do with that other John.
* gleefully :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:50]

When you do something gleefully, you do it in an extremely happy way.
If two kids call to each other gleefully across the playground,
there's laughter and delight in their voices.

Wedding guests might rush gleefully onto the dance floor when the DJ
plays a popular song, and a child who is trick or treating for the
first time will often gleefully dress in her ghost costume and even
more gleefully watch her plastic pumpkin fill with Halloween candy.
The adjective gleeful and related noun glee are at the root of
gleefully, all of them sharing the Latin root word gliu,
"entertainment, mirth, jest, or play."

This John, however, in that he was proudly and
flagrantly homosexual, in that he gleefully mocked himself with all
manner of mincing gestures and extravagant poses, in that he took
delight in silly jokes and ridiculous songs and a whole repertoire
of childish humor, had nothing to do with that other John.
* effusive :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:51]

Getting a compliment from your effusive Aunt Sally can be a little
embarrassing. Since she's so effusive, Aunt Sally holds nothing back,
gushing with enthusiasm.

The adjective effusive means "extravagantly demonstrative," and if you
know someone who expresses positive emotions in a heartfelt, bubbly
way, you understand just what the word means. The word effusive has a
surprisingly similar definition in geology; it describes a particular
kind of volcanic eruption, one in which lava bubbles up out of the
volcano and flows around it.

I don’t think I’ve ever known a funnier or more effusive person than
John.
* hunch :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:51]

When you pose for pictures with short friends, you hunch over so you
don't tower above them — you scrunch up your shoulders, bend your
knees, and try to look smaller.

You can also have a hunch, which has nothing to do with scrunching.
When you have a hunch about something, you think it might be true.
Your dog bolts over the fence, and you have a hunch he's heading for
the neighbor who feeds him pâté. Hunch is an odd word of unknown
origin, which seems to have originally meant "to push or shove" — to
nudge.

At
the next semiannual meeting, John’s hunch proved to be correct.

A publisher
would hand us a book, we would split the work in two (literally
tearing the book in half if we had only one copy), and set a daily
quota for ourselves.
* downright :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:53]

The adjective downright is used to emphasize something, or to mean
"utterly." For example, you could say that your brother's loud and
junky old car is a downright embarrassment.

Downright works as an adjective or adverb, so you can describe your
dad's brownies as downright delicious, your sister's terrible jokes as
downright awful, or your loss of the spelling bee as a downright
disgrace. In the thirteenth century, downright meant "straight down,"
but it had changed by 1300, to instead mean "thoroughly."

Except for one book by Sartre
(Life/Situations, a collection of essays and interviews), the books
the publishers gave us were dull, undistinguished works that ranged
in quality from not very good to downright bad.
* pieties :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:54]

Piety is devotion to God or to religious practices. Nuns who pray all
day long are famous for their piety. If you have filial piety it means
you're devoted to your parents.

Piety is sometimes used in a disapproving way to mean that the person
is only pretending to be devoted or good. It was borrowed from the
French word pieté, meaning "piety or pity," ultimately from the Latin
pius, "devoted, kind." This Latin adjective is also the source of our
English adjective pious.

With all the pieties floating
around the art world, I found it refreshing to hear him say that.
* credulity :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:54]

Did you know that if you say credulity ten times fast it starts to
sound like orange? If you believe that, then you have a lot of
credulity. Credulity means gullibility, or a willingness to believe
anything.

Credulity is a tendency to believe in things too easily and without
evidence. If a swindler is trying to sell you fake medicine, then he
is "preying on your credulity." This noun is associated with being
naïve, gullible or innocent. It shouldn’t be confused with
credibility, which means “believability,” although it is often misused
in this way. You might hear someone say, “the farfetched plot of that
movie strained credulity,” but what he or she really means is
“believability,” or “credibility.”

The common theme in the stories
was deception, after all, playing people for fools, and from the way
he laughed when he told them—as if gloating, as if reveling in his
own cynicism—I felt that perhaps he was only toying with me,
buttering me up with compliments in order to test the limits of my
credulity.
* buttering :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:54]

Butter is a creamy spread made from milk fat. Your favorite breakfast
might be hot toast slathered with butter.

The process of making butter involves churning cream until the fats
coagulate and become creamy and pale yellow. Butter is sometimes
salted, and usually formed into sticks for cooks to use in frying,
baking, and spreading on corn on the cob and baked goods. To do this
is to butter your bread. The Greek root word is boutyron, literally
"cow cheese," from bous, "cow."

The common theme in the stories
was deception, after all, playing people for fools, and from the way
he laughed when he told them—as if gloating, as if reveling in his
own cynicism—I felt that perhaps he was only toying with me,
buttering me up with compliments in order to test the limits of my
credulity.
* awestruck :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:55]

To be awestruck is to be full of complete wonder, amazement, or dread
for something. Swimming with a humpback whale or being near a tornado
would leave most people awestruck. When you're awestruck, you're
amazed.

Awestruck literally means to be struck with awe — a feeling of
profound amazement. You can be awestruck by something surprising,
wonderful, or even scary. Imagine the breathless feeling you’d get
swimming next to a whale! That’s awestruck. This is a very powerful
feeling that would never apply to everyday things. Being awestruck
leaves you stunned. You can't quite believe what you're seeing or
hearing.

Or
how, occasionally, he would turn up at expensive restaurants dressed
in a sham military uniform (made for him by his tailor and
representing no identifiable rank, country, or branch of service),
but because that uniform looked good, and because it was covered
with countless medals and stars, he would be given the best table in
the house by the awestruck maître d’—without a reservation, without
a tip, without so much as a glance.
* sham :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:56]

A sham is a fake. If you frequently order products advertised on
late-night, hour-long television commercials, you’ve probably ended up
with at least one item that was a sham. All-purpose, industrial
strength stain remover, anyone?

Sham can be used to refer to people as well as to things. Remember
that doctor from the late-night TV commercial advertising
UltraMiracleCure vitamin pills? He’s probably a sham, or a quack. Some
sources claim that the word sham originated in the 17th century and
was derived from the English word shame, but who knows? Maybe that
theory’s a sham too.

Or
how, occasionally, he would turn up at expensive restaurants dressed
in a sham military uniform (made for him by his tailor and
representing no identifiable rank, country, or branch of service),
but because that uniform looked good, and because it was covered
with countless medals and stars, he would be given the best table in
the house by the awestruck maître d’—without a reservation, without
a tip, without so much as a glance.
* manic :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:56]

Manic means frenzied. If you drink 18 cups of coffee in a single
sitting and haven't slept for three days, chances are you're manic.

If manic sounds like maniac to you, you're on the right track. Someone
who is in a manic state is affected by mania. If you're manic you're
in a wound-up, fast-acting, unhinged wild state. People with bi-polar
disorder experience manic highs and terrible lows. Other things can be
manic, too, like the pace of city life or the flabmoyant outfit you're
wearing with seven different colors and eight different patterns.

He was so thoroughly
high-strung, so odd and manic in his behavior, that I couldn’t help
but be impressed.
* dragged :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:56]

To drag something means to physically pull it, like when you drag your
sofa to the other side of the living room in order to get a better
view of the TV.

Drag can also mean to prolong something. In this case, drag is often
followed by the words "out" or "on." You could describe a class that
drags on for hours, or try to drag out your homework to get out of
doing the dishes. You can also drag someone unwillingly into a
discussion or other situation. Anything that's boring and tedious can
also be called a drag — like lunches with your great aunt Martha or
cleaning the bathroom.

If left to my own devices, I could have
completed the work in one or two days, but because Kosinski wouldn’t
let the manuscript out of his house, I had to go to his apartment on
West Fifty-seventh Street to do the work, and because he hovered
around me constantly, interrupting me every twenty minutes with
stories, anecdotes, and nervous chatter, the job dragged on for
seven days.
* hovered :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:57]

A hover craft flies low over the ground or water — it hovers. Hover
can also mean waver. Think of someone that can’t decide exactly where
to land.

To help remember the meaning of hover, think of it as containing the
preposition over: things that hover hang over. A temperature can hover
around forty degrees, a grade in a class can hover around a B.

If left to my own devices, I could have
completed the work in one or two days, but because Kosinski wouldn’t
let the manuscript out of his house, I had to go to his apartment on
West Fifty-seventh Street to do the work, and because he hovered
around me constantly, interrupting me every twenty minutes with
stories, anecdotes, and nervous chatter, the job dragged on for
seven days.
* emanated :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:57]

Emanate means to give off, like the sound of laughter that emanates
from your sister's room during her slumber party. If spooky sounds
emanate from the closet, don’t open the door!

The word emanate comes from the Latin emanare, which means “to flow
out.” Things that emanate come from somewhere. Heat emanates from a
fire, and smoke emanates from a chimney. This word can also be used
figuratively: for example, you might say that your upbeat and
optimistic best friend emanates positivity.

Intense controversy has
surrounded Kosinski in recent years, and since a large share of it
emanated from the novel I worked on (Cockpit), I feel that I should
add my testimony to the record.
* controversy :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:58]

A controversy is a dispute or argument in which people express strong
opposing views. When a popular TV show kills off a well-loved
character, there's bound to be a lot of controversy.

Controversy means a quarrel (often public) involving strong
disagreement, but the topic can be as unimportant as a new movie.
There might be a controversy in the pages of fashion magazines over
whether shorter hems are really in style, or about wearing white after
Labor Day. Controversy is from the Latin contrōversus, "turned in an
opposite direction," from the prefix contrā, "against," plus versus, a
form of vertere, "to turn."

Intense controversy has
surrounded Kosinski in recent years, and since a large share of it
emanated from the novel I worked on (Cockpit), I feel that I should
add my testimony to the record.
* crafty :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:02]

If people call you crafty, they probably mean you are sly and a little
deceptive. Then again, they could be saying that you are really good
at knitting, beading, and turning old t-shirts into funky pillowcases.

The adjective crafty comes from the Old English word cræftig, which
meant “strong” or “powerful,” but the meaning of crafty these days has
to do with being skilled at getting what you want through manipulation
or trickery. Dickens’ Artful Dodger, the con-man from Oliver Twist, is
crafty. Handmade items, and sometimes the people who make them, can
also be called crafty, like your crafty sister who always makes you
unique birthday gifts.

Arthur took pleasure in turning a
profit, enjoyed the push and pull of running the enterprise and
making it succeed, and while he was also a man of great
sophistication and refinement, a genuine intellectual who lived in
and for the world of ideas, there was no getting around the fact
that he was a crafty entrepreneur.
* genuine :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:03]

Genuine things are true or authentic. When you're talking about
people, being genuine has to do with being sincere.

This word has to do with things and people that are true. A genuine
blonde is a real blonde — no hair dye involved. A genuine friend is a
real friend you can trust when the chips are down. Genuine feelings
are real feelings — not fake feelings put on as a show. A genuine
hundred dollar bill is the real McCoy, not a counterfeit bill. When
something is the real thing, it's genuine.

* measly :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:03]

Measly is a great word for describing an amount or number so small
that it's ridiculous. You'll be disappointed (and maybe even annoyed)
if you're paid a measly six dollars to babysit a toddler for two
hours.

If you've got a measly ten minutes to eat lunch between classes, it's
a laughably short amount of time — hardly enough to unwrap your tuna
sandwich. And when a detective has a measly number of clues to help
her solve a crime, it can seem nearly impossible. This informal word
comes from British slang, and it originally meant "affected by
measles."

The difference between us was
not that I understood the issues any better than he did (if
anything, it was just the opposite), but that he was a businessman
and I wasn’t, which explained why he was the boss and I made just a
few measly dollars per hour.

He turns the warning on its head and
asks us to fondle the thing he has made.
* swathed :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:05]

When you swathe yourself in a blanket, you are wrapping or swaddling
yourself up in it. Swathe a baby up and you're creating a little
cocoon where she can sleep.

Sometimes spelled "swath," swathe is commonly used to talk about how
you wrap up a baby in a soft blanket. The verb can also refer to
binding a wound with bandages; as a noun, a swathe is a long strip or
bandage to protect a wound. Swathe derives from an Old English word,
swaþian, which means "to wrap."

When you sit down to write about the catalogue that
Marcel Duchamp designed for the 1947 Surrealist exhibition in Paris,
for example—the one with the rubber breast on the cover, the
celebrated bare falsie that came with the admonition “Prière de
Toucher” (“Please Touch”)—and you find that catalogue protected by
several layers of bubble wrap, which in turn have been swathed in
thick brown paper, which in turn has been slipped into a plastic
bag, you can’t help but pause for a moment and wonder if you aren’t
wasting your time.
* reverence :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:05]

Reverence is a feeling of deep respect or awe — like what you have for
a president, a hero, or a favorite football player.

Reverence can be a feeling of awe, and it can also describe how you
treat someone, particularly when used with the word with. To treat
someone "with reverence" is to show them intense respect. Your friends
may respect you for your loyalty, though they probably do not bow to
you with reverence every day.

I enjoyed looking through the material I had to
write about, but I didn’t have the mind of a collector, and I could
never bring myself to feel the proper awe or reverence for the
things we sold.
* rein :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:05]

Rein is both a noun and a verb for guiding and restraining. You can
use the long strap, or rein, on a horse to control its speed and
direction, and you can rein in your own tongue by closing your mouth.

Rein rhymes with rain but the two words describe very different
things. Rain comes down all over the place, uncontrolled, while a rein
holds things in place or controls what comes out. As a noun, rein is
often used as a plural word "reins" when talking about actual leather
restraints used in horse riding, but a rein also is something
non-physical like when you put a rein on spending by shopping less.

There was a certain fusty precision to the work
(measuring the books, examining them for imperfections, detailing
provenances when necessary), but many of the items were quite
thrilling to hold, and Arthur gave me free rein to express my
opinions about them, even to inject an occasional dose of humor if I
felt like it.
* provenances :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:06]

Where something comes from is its provenance. If a style of music
originated in the capital of Rhode Island, you could say that its
provenance was Providence.

Some items of foreign provenance are taxed more heavily than domestic
products. If you claim that an artwork put up for sale was stolen from
your family's art collection, an investigation may be ordered to
resolve issues of provenance. In this case, provenance refers to who
has the legal right to the specific work of art, or to whom it
belongs.

There was a certain fusty precision to the work
(measuring the books, examining them for imperfections, detailing
provenances when necessary), but many of the items were quite
thrilling to hold, and Arthur gave me free rein to express my
opinions about them, even to inject an occasional dose of humor if I
felt like it.
* fusty :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:06]

Use the adjective fusty to describe something that's covered with dust
and smells a little old and musty. Your grandmother's attic is
probably full of fusty knickknacks.

Fusty is perfect for describing anything from a slightly mildewed
quilt at the back of your closet to your brother's camping gear,
forgotten in the trunk of his car for months and smelling a little
ripe. You can also use it to talk about an antique idea or attitude,
like your uncle's fusty, outdated opinions on the roles of men and
women. The Old French root of fusty is fusté, "tasting or smelling of
the cask," from fuist, "wine cask."

There was a certain fusty precision to the work

provenances when necessary), but many of the items were quite
thrilling to hold, and Arthur gave me free rein to express my
opinions about them, even to inject an occasional dose of humor if I
felt like it.
* shrine :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:07]

Set up some candles and a photograph of someone important in your life
in the corner of a room where you spend time reflecting silently, and
you've created a shrine.

Shrine comes from the Latin scrinium meaning "case or box for keeping
papers." Think of a shrine as a niche or case in which the spirit of
someone special is kept. It could be a statue or some other form of
commemoration to either a person or a relic. A shrine can be as small
as a tiny mantel in your house or it can be as massive as a building
commemorating, or shrining, a sacred person.

I spent four or
five hours there every afternoon, and it was a bit like working in a
museum, a small shrine to the avant-garde.

Part hobbyhorse, part serious commercial venture, Ex
Libris was a rare-book concern that specialized in publications
connected with twentieth-century art.
* vowed :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:09]

To vow is to make an earnest promise or pledge. People getting married
often vow to stick together “till death do us part,” while a
presidential candidate might vow to lower taxes.

You can use vow as both a noun and a verb: A vow is a solemn
declaration; to vow is the act of making that promise. Vows are meant
to be serious, sacred things, even vows made with the best intentions
can be broken. Wrote American short-story writer and poet Dorothy
Parker, “By the time you swear you are his, shivering and sighing, And
he vows his passion is infinite and undying—Lady, make a note of this:
One of you is lying.”

I had vowed to swallow my medicine,
but just when the spoon was coming toward me, I shut my mouth.
* opted :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:09]

To opt is to choose. Given the alternative, most kids will opt for a
cupcake over a ham sandwich.

When you're signing up for next semester's classes, you might opt for
another history class, or instead opt for advanced biology. Whenever
you have more than one alternative, you have the chance to opt for
something. You can also opt out of something, or choose not to do it
at all. Opt comes from the French verb opter, "to choose," from the
Latin root optare, "desire," and it's related to option.

It’s not that I didn’t find a
job, but rather than accept the full-time position I had been
offered (as junior editor in a large publishing house), I opted for
a half-time job at half the pay.
* squeezes :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:09]

When you squeeze something, you put pressure on it. If you squeeze
your toothpaste from the bottom up, you'll get the most out of your
tube.

The word squeeze has to do with force or pressure. When you squeeze
something, like an orange, you are crushing it to extract juice. When
you squeeze into a pair of jeans, you're forcing yourself into them.
When you give someone a squeeze, you're giving them a tight hug. And
when you're in a squeeze, you're in a tight spot, or a bind.

I was trying to act sensibly, and after
all the ups and downs I’d been through, all the tight corners and
desperate squeezes that had trapped me over the years, I was
determined not to repeat my old mistakes.
* curb :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:10]

The hard thing about learning how to parallel park is trying to get
the car close enough to the curb without hitting it. A curb is the
edge of the sidewalk beside the road.

When you're using the word curb as a noun, it's the raised edging
beside a street. When curb is a verb, it means to restrain or hold
back, like when you curb your impulse to laugh while watching a badly
acted play. Curb comes from the Latin word for "curve," curvus, which
describes the shape of a restraining strap on a horse's head — in the
fifteenth century, this band was called a curb.

We climbed into the back seat, the driver started up the
engine, and the car pulled away from the curb.
* upholstery :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:10]

Upholstery refers to the covering on furniture. Without upholstery,
your couch wouldn't be very comfortable.

This is a word specific to furniture, especially the chairs and
couches found in most living rooms. Upholstery consists of the
material — including springs, padding, and fabric — that cover the
bare bones of the furniture you sit on. If you have ever spilled a
drink on a couch, someone might have yelled, "Watch out! You'll stain
the upholstery!" People who put the upholstery on furniture are called
upholsterers.

It was a tan Jaguar
with leather upholstery, and the man behind the wheel was dressed in
a white shirt.
* ate :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:13]

If you leave an antique flowerpot outside all winter, the snow and
rain might eat the paint, making it look even older than it is.

You probably know that eat means "to consume food," because you do
that several times a day. But we also use the verb eat for other
situations involving using something up or wearing it down. If your
art project eats up all your art supplies, that means you don't have
any left. Leaving your car lights on will eat through your battery.
Something eating away at us is worrying us. Don't let money stress eat
away at your happiness.

The crazy girl kept showing up with one of her friends, a Central
American Hare Krishna with a shaved head and orange robes, and
boredom ate away at me like some tropical disease.
* muslin :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:14]

Muslin is a kind of cotton fabric that's plain and lightweight.
Designers and dressmakers often use muslin to make inexpensive sample
garments for fitting.

Perfecting designs using muslin is so common that the practice garment
itself is often referred to as a muslin: "Here, try on this muslin
before we cut the pattern out of the silk." The word muslin comes from
the French mousseline, which is rooted in Mosul, the city in Iraq
where Western traders first encountered the fabric. This ancient
muslin was a luxurious material, while today's is much more ordinary
and affordable.

My room
was in a stucco outbuilding on the brother’s property, and I slept
under muslin netting to guard against the tarantulas and mosquitoes.
* stucco :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:14]

Stucco is a material that's used to coat ceilings, walls, and the
exterior of buildings. If you travel to the southwestern United
States, you'll see many homes with stucco exteriors and terra-cotta
roof tiles.

Stucco is a type of plaster, a substance that goes on as a wet paste
and dries hard. In fact, in Italian, stucco means "plaster," from a
Germanic source it shares with the Old High German stukki, or "crust."
Stucco is mainly decorative, often covering metal or cinderblock, but
it's also a weather-resistant coating. While regular plaster is
usually smooth and white, stucco is most often textured.

My room
was in a stucco outbuilding on the brother’s property, and I slept
under muslin netting to guard against the tarantulas and mosquitoes.
* aimless :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:15]

If you're aimless, you don't have a destination or a goal in mind.
Aimless wandering through a forest might take you in circles, or worse
yet, get you lost.

The adjective aimless is good for describing things that have no
particular purpose or plan. You might prefer traveling with a map or
GPS, while your best friend likes to drive in an aimless way, turning
down dirt roads or exiting the highway impulsively. When you call a
person aimless, you probably mean that he doesn't appear to have any
ambition: "My brother's an aimless drifter." Aimless comes from aim,
"purpose" or "target."

I was staying with Madame X’s brother
(whose unhappy marriage to an American woman was on its last legs),
and I filled my days with aimless walks around the dusty town,
stepping over mangy dogs, batting flies out of my face, and
accepting invitations to drink beers with the local drunks.
* bid                                                                  :Hand:

So there I sat, biding my time in the little village of Tepotzolán,
hoping that Madame X would wake up one morning and discover that she
had a new outlook on life.
* quandary :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:15]

How to define the word quandary? Wow, this is quite a dilemma. What to
do, what to do? Hmmm. Looks like this moment itself is a quandary: a
tough situation that will be really hard to resolve.

If you’re uncertain what to do because all of your options seem
unpleasant, you’re probably in a quandary. Some voters find themselves
in a quandary when they dislike all of the candidates. A more common
quandary is when you plan two events at the same time and can’t decide
which one to attend. Some synonyms are predicament, dilemma, plight,
and pickle — and choosing which word to use is a quandary in itself.

Such was the quandary I found myself in.
* murky :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:16]

Something that's murky is dim, gloomy or hard to see through clearly.
Think of the dark fog around a haunted house or the cloudy, muddy
water in a swamp.

Rarely used before the 17th century, this adjective came about by
adding a "y" to the word murk. Murk itself evolved from myrkr, a Norse
word for "darkness.” Things that are murky are unclear; that goes for
murky, sediment-filled lakes, shady business deals, and arguments that
don't seem to make any sense.

To assume that a book can be written by a person who is not a writer
is already a murky proposition, but granting that such a thing is
possible, and granting that the person who wants to write the book has
someone else to help with the writing of it, perhaps the two of them,
with much hard work and dedication, can arrive at an acceptable
result.
* languish                                                             :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:18]

To languish is to become pitiful or weak because you're sick, in love,
or stuck somewhere. A prisoner might languish in jail, longing for her
freedom.

Languish, like languid, is from the Latin word languere which means
"to be weak or faint." Your houseplants might languish in a dark dry
corner. A Romantic poet might languish on a velvet couch with the back
of her hand to her forehead. People in operas love to languish: The
main character in La Traviatta, Violetta, languishes from longing and
eventually tuberculosis.

I wrote one or two short poems, but otherwise I languished, unable to
think, bogged down by a persistent, nameless anxiety.
* tense :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:40]

When something's stretched tight, it's tense. A rope can be tense. So
can a muscle. When a person's tense, they're anxious.

When a situation is tense, you might say you could "cut the tension
with a knife." When a muscle tenses up, it contracts suddenly–-a
person can be said to tense up also. The opposite of tense is
"relaxed." If you tense up during exams, it's probably best to learn
some relaxation techniques. The brain works best when it's relaxed.

When I did manage to find some time for myself, I was too tense to
write very well.
* wound :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:40]

A wound is a serious injury, especially a deep cut through the skin.
But things like pride and feelings can also get wounded.

Wounds are serious: we're talking a lot worse than just a scrape or
booboo. Just about all the meanings of this word have to do with being
hurt. If you got stabbed, you got a stab wound. Soldiers in battle get
a lot of wounds from enemies. If someone told you to shut up, they
might wound your feelings. If you slipped in a puddle in front of your
friends, that might wound your pride.

Months went by, and every piece of paper I touched with my pen wound
up in the garbage.
* tempt                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:42]

To tempt is to lure or entice. You might tempt your runaway dog back
inside with pieces of cheese.

The verb tempt often has negative implications: "Don't let those
bullies tempt you into picking on smaller kids!" When something tempts
you, it's often with the knowledge that it's not the best idea,
however attractive it might be. Tempt was originally a religious term,
meaning "to entice to evil or sin," while today it's more likely to be
a slice of cake that tempts us than the devil.

Now that I lived in a house with a basement, don’t think I wasn’t
tempted.

But I was a desperate man, a man with my back against the wall, and I
knew that if I didn’t think of something fast, the firing squad was
about to fill my body with bullets.
* desperate :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:48]

Desperate means "having lost all hope." If you are desperate for food,
it means you are starving, possibly about to die. If you are in a
desperate situation, it means things are really, really bad.

Desperate, desparate, or despirate? The word desperate is misspelled
often enough that it's the despair of English teachers. Both desperate
and despair come from the same Latin verb as despair. Don't mix it up
with disparate, a totally different word that means "distinctive,
different, various."

But I was a desperate man, a man with my back against the wall, and I
knew that if I didn’t think of something fast, the firing squad was
about to fill my body with bullets.
* earnest :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:49]

If you are earnest, it means you are serious about something. Your
parents might not want you to drop out of school to follow some
fly-by-night dream, but if you're earnest about wanting a career in
show biz, they'll support you.

If you are earnest, you pursue your purpose in a steady, sincere, and
eager way. The phrase in earnest uses earnest as a noun, as in, "Once
you stop fooling around and start studying in earnest, you'll find you
learn the material quickly." Oscar Wilde's classic play The Importance
of Being Earnest plays on the fact that Ernest is also a man's name.

It almost sounds like a joke now, but I was in dead earnest.
* grab                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:49]

When you grab something, you clutch at it. When a party-goer breaks
open a piñata, the other guests usually grab wildly at the candy that
cascades out of it.

You can grab for the string of a balloon as it floats away, or grab
your friend in a hug. Another way to grab is to make an impression:
"When I hear a marching band, it grabs my attention." A "grab bag" is
a random mixture of things, or a bag of goodies you can reach into and
grab from. If something's "up for grabs." it's available: "This last
piece of pie is up for grabs!"

I knew that my chances were next to nil, but once the idea grabbed
hold of me, I couldn’t shake free of it.
* nuttier                                                              :Hand:

Nuttier things had happened, I told myself, and if I wasn’t willing to
put a little time and effort into having a go at it, then what kind of
spineless shit was I?
* spineless :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:50]

If you're spineless, you're weak or cowardly — or both. It would be
spineless to watch a bully pick on someone much smaller and not try to
intervene.

You can certainly use this adjective to literally mean "lacking a
spine," and you might if you're talking about invertebrates like the
spineless forest lizard or the Garo spineless eel. It's more common to
call people spineless as a derogatory way of commenting on their
weakness. A spineless superhero is too scared to confront the bad
guys, and a spineless politician avoids conversation with critical
constituents.

put a little time and effort into having a go at it, then what kind of
spineless shit was I?

The work was largely a matter of getting the numbers
right and fiddling with the math, but I was well versed in the
intricacies of baseball, and it didn’t take me long to arrive at the
correct formulas.
* verse                                                                :Hand:

To be versed in something is to know it well and have experience with
it. If you’re well versed in Middle English literature, you know that
Chaucer wrote The Canterbury Tales in 1475. Go you.

Versed comes from the Latin word versari which means basically “to
busy oneself, to be engaged.” If you’re versed (sounds like “verst”)
in a subject, you’ve busied yourself with it and now you know it well.
A history professor is versed in history. Someone with a massive comic
book collection is probably versed in superheroes. Sometimes people
say a person is well versed instead of versed, but either way, that
person knows what they’re talking about.

* brag :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:54]

When you're bragging, you're boasting. If you can't stop talking about
your fancy new shoes, that's bragging.

Ever notice how some people are full of themselves and constantly
telling you about the great things they've done? Those folks like to
brag. Bragging is a verbal kind of showing off. We all do it
sometimes, and it's almost always annoying when other people do it. A
specific boast can be called a brag. Athletes often brag before big
games. But only the winners can brag after, because they backed up
their words.

The design was nothing to brag about, but since I had no experience or
talent as a designer, that was to be expected.
* cram                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:55]

To cram is to crowd or stuff people or things into a limited amount of
space. You might be tempted to cram your mouth full of your mom's
chocolate chip cookies, especially if they just came out of the oven
and are still warm and gooey.

You can cram yourself with food, or cram your books onto a shelf
that's not quite big enough to hold them. A writer might cram one book
with dozens of characters, or you could cram homemade pancakes with
blueberries. Another way to cram is to study for a test all in one
session: "I haven't studied at all yet — I'll have to stay up tonight
and cram." The Old English root, crammian, means "stuff something into
something else."

I was striving for a clear, serviceable presentation, something that
could be read at a glance and not confuse anyone, and given that so
much information had to be crammed onto every card, I think I
accomplished at least that.
* dither                                                               :Hand:

For the time being, after much dithering back
and forth, I dubbed my little brainchild Action Baseball.
* dub                                                                  :Hand:

If your brother is obsessive about doing the laundry, then you might
dub him the "Scion of the Spin Cycle" or the "Dean of Detergent,"
meaning you’ve given him a funny nickname that’s inspired by his
personal quirks.

The verb dub traces back to the French word adober, meaning “equip
with armor,” and originally referred to making someone a knight. Dub
still carries that meaning, although now it's more likely to describe
the giving out of titles of a different kind. Use this word when you
give someone a playful nickname or an unofficial title based on some
notable characteristic the person has, like dubbing your sister the
"Queen of Shoes."

For the time being, after much dithering back and forth, I dubbed my
little brainchild Action Baseball.
* fair                                                                 :Hand:

When used as a noun, fair refers to a traveling show with games,
rides, and farmers showing off their prized pigs, similar to a
carnival. As an adjective, it gets a bit trickier.

The adjective fair, has several different meanings. If someone says,
"That's not fair!” they mean whatever happened wasn't just or done in
an unbiased way. If you have fair skin, you have a pale complexion. If
the weather is fair, it's a gorgeous day out. If the rides at the fair
were fair, then they were just so-so. And watch out if the umpire
shouts "fair ball!" during the baseball game — that means it was hit
within the foul lines.

I was still working on the cards at that point, but he encouraged me
to get the game in order as quickly as I could and take it to the New
York Toy Fair, which was just five or six weeks down the road.

I was carrying a briefcase, but the only thing inside it was
the game, which was stowed inside a cigar box.
* stowed :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:01]

When you stow something, you store it or pack it away neatly. If you
move into a tiny college dorm room, you might have to stow your shoes
under the bed.

On an airplane, you are only allowed to bring small suitcases that you
can stow in the overhead bins or under the seat in front of you. In an
adventure novel, pirates might stow their treasure in a seaside cave.
In Old English, stow was a noun, meaning "a place or spot."

I was carrying a briefcase, but the only thing inside it was
the game, which was stowed inside a cigar box.
* swarming :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:02]

A swarm is a good word for a large group of bees going on the attack —
not good news. Like bees, any group of people or animals can be
considered a swarm if they act together and quickly — even fiercely.

On a hot day, when an ice-cream truck shows up, it's usually greeted
by a swarm of hot, hungry kids. People at a concert can be a swarm —
and people in the swarm can be hurt, because there's lots of pushing
and shoving. When tickets for a popular movie go on sale, a swarm of
people will swarm the theater. As you can see, swarm works as either a
noun or verb, and people could teach bees a thing or two about
swarming.

Even at that early hour, the place was swarming with people.
* toot :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:03]

Toot is both the act of blowing on a horn and the sound that comes out
when you do. The word is fun to say, a favorite of children pretending
to be cars. It suggests a kind of merry, or at least chipper,
sensibility.

Speaking of merriment, toot can also refer to a night of drinking and
carousing. Light, fun drinking: think 1920s flappers dancing in
fountains, not hardcore alcoholics with bottles in paper bags. It's
the car behind you letting you know the light has changed or the
cheerful sound of a tugboat asking larger ships to make way. Even
"tooting your own horn" is just not that serious — it's a lighthearted
spin on the otherwise obnoxious act of bragging.

Every kiddie amusement and
gadget ever dreamed of was packed into that hall, and there wasn’t
one of them that didn’t whistle or clang or toot or beep or roar.
* din :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:04]

Walk into the average school cafeteria at lunchtime, and you'll get a
good sense of what a din is — loud, confused, continuous, generally
unpleasant, and often potentially headache-inducing noise.

Who knew noise pollution was a problem in ancient times? Humans have
been experiencing loud, sustained, annoying sounds for centuries,
judging by the etymology of the word din. It traces its roots back to
Old English dyne or dynn, which had the same meaning as din does
today, only with a different pronunciation. Before that, it popped up
in Old Norse as dynr and meant to "come rumbling down" — fitting, from
the language that gave us Thor, the God of Thunder.

As
I made my way through the din, it occurred to me that the briefcase
under my arm was the only silent object in the building.
* Contempt :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:06]

Reserve the noun contempt for an extreme lack of respect: a food snob
has nothing but contempt for mass-produced burgers and fries at a
fast-food joint.

Contempt has nothing to do with the verb condemn, despite the
similarity in sound and meaning; it is from Latin temnere "to
despise," and if you despise someone, you have contempt for them. It's
a harsh term and should be used with care; it's stronger than either
disdain or scorn. It suggests you find someone or something utterly
worthless. That food snob might say the words "Big Mac" or "Whopper"
with a voice dripping in contempt.

Contempt flickered in his eyes.
* flickered :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:06]

To flicker is to flash on and off at random. If your computer screen
is flickering right now, you are probably having trouble reading this.

Something that is flickering is flashing on and off in an
unpredictable way. A fluorescent light may flicker for a while before
it stops working. A flicker is also a quick flash or burst of light,
like a glint or a spark. Similarly, flicker can refer to a sudden and
short-lived feeling. A child opening a present might have a flicker of
excitement before realizing that the box contains only tube socks and
underwear.

Contempt flickered in his eyes.
* turd :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:14]

It was as if I
had just handed him a dog turd and asked him to smell it.
* consolation :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:18]

Consolation is something that makes someone feel better after they're
disappointed or sad.

This is a word for things that try to console someone. A consolation
prize isn't as good as first prize, but it's better than nothing. A
hug is little consolation when you've had your heart broken. You give
someone consolation when try to cheer them up. Consolation can be the
act of making someone feel better, like trying to make them laugh, but
it can also be something that makes someone happy, like a plate of
warm cookies.

After the sadistic
treatment I’d been given that morning, I found some consolation in
that.
* booth :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:20]

A booth is a temporary table, tent, or area that you set up in order
to sell something. You might have a cupcake booth at a school craft
fair, for example.

You might stop at an information booth in a tourist town, or or shop
for records at a music booth in your local flea market. You can use
the noun booth for any small, impermanent stall, kiosk, or stand.
Another kind of booth is the cozy, private seating area at a
restaurant that often has high walls and benches around a table. Booth
has an Old Norse origin, the word buth, which is rooted in búa, or
"dwell."

They weren’t doing much at that hour, just sitting around their little
booth and chewing the fat, and when I told them about my game, they
seemed more than happy to have a look at it.
* rigged :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:20]

When something is rigged, it's fully equipped and ready to go. You'll
usually find this adjective describing a sailboat or ship with masts
and sails.

A fully rigged boat has all the necessary ropes, sails, and masts that
it needs to travel on the water. While this nautical adjective is
narrowly focused on sailing vessels, you can also use rigged to mean
"fraudulent" or "tampered with." If a politician talks about a rigged
election, he is not-so-subtly accusing his opponent of conspiring to
illegally manipulate the outcome of a vote. This meaning comes from a
now-obsolete meaning of rig, "a trick."

If I had rigged the cards, the results of the game I played with them
could not have been more exciting, more true to life.
* nip :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:21]

A nip is a tiny bite, a cold feeling, or a strong taste on your
tongue. It’s also a verb for pinching or biting something, but not
always in a bad way.

Being nipped now and then isn’t a big deal. If a puppy nips your
finger, no worries. The cold morning nip when you get out of bed is
uncomfortable, but put on socks and you’re fine. Nipping can be a good
thing sometimes, like in the phrase “nip it in the bud,” which means
stopping a poor behavior or activity when it first starts. A nip can
also mean a small sip of something, like hot chocolate — which is a
good idea if you’re feeling a nip of a cold draft.

It was nip and tuck the whole way, tension riding on every pitch, and
after eight and a half innings of threats, rallies, and two-out
strikeouts with the bases loaded, the score stood at two to one.
* tuck :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:21]

To tuck is to fold, gather, or insert, like the way you tuck your
sheets under your mattress when you make the bed in the morning or the
way you tuck your lucky stuffed unicorn into your backpack on the day
of a big test.

You can tuck your shirt into your waistband, and tuck your jeans into
your cowboy boots. You can also tuck a child into bed or tuck your
book under your arm to carry it. The verb tuck can also be used
informally to mean "eat with gusto," like when you tuck into a giant
bowl of spaghetti.

It was
nip and tuck the whole way, tension riding on every pitch, and after
eight and a half innings of threats, rallies, and two-out strikeouts
with the bases loaded, the score stood at two to one.
* astonishment :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:24]

Astonishment is what you feel when you're extremely surprised. If a
cat stood up and recited the Preamble to the Constitution, you’d stare
in astonishment.

Astonishment is the feeling of being blown away and shocked by
something. It’s the noun form of astonish, which is a verb meaning,
basically “to have your mind blown.” A professional magician aims to
create astonishment. A basketball player who hits every three-point
shot might make fans feel astonishment. Many people feel astonishment
when looking at something like the Grand Canyon. This is a strong word
that shouldn't refer to minor surprises. True astonishment is rare.

Then, to everyone’s astonishment, with the count at
two balls and two strikes, the next batter hit a home run to win the
game.
* undisguisable :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:24]

It was a classic baseball thriller, and when the man
from Joliet turned over that final card, his face lit up with an
expression of pure, undisguisable joy.
* mull :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:25]

The verb mull means to think deeply about something, the way you might
mull over your choice of what college to attend.

When you mull something over, you ponder or seriously consider it. You
could mull over what aid organization to donate money to following a
natural disaster, or mull over what to study in college. People are
most likely to mull over important decisions, but you can use the word
mull, almost always with over, any time you're giving serious
consideration to something. A completely different meaning of mull is
"to heat, sweeten, and spice," as when you make mulled cider.

They wanted to think about it, they said, to mull it over for a while
before giving me an answer.
* dismal :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:26]

Dismal is a dreary, depressing sort of bad. "With the cold rain and
their team behind by six field goals, the mood in the stands was so
dismal even the cheerleaders had lost their 'Rah.'"

Dismal comes from the Latin dies mali which means "bad days." There is
a hopelessness implied in the word. If you fell on the way to school
and cut your knee, it would be bad, but not dismal. If you fell into a
giant mud puddle and had to wear dirty, crusty clothes until you got
home, it might make the school day seem pretty dismal.

After all the dismal, demoralizing events of that day, there was
suddenly cause for hope, and I walked out of the Toy Fair thinking
that I might actually get somewhere with my crazy scheme.
* dawn                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:27]

The noun dawn refers to the first light of day, or the first time
period, like the dawn of a new era, which occurs when a new president
takes office.

Not just the beginning of a day, the noun dawn can refer to any
beginning, like the dawn of the Internet era. As a verb, dawn can mean
"become light" or "become clear," like when it dawns on you that you
left an important paper at home today. In that case, you can suddenly
see what you did wrong, like at the dawn of a new day, when it is no
longer dark and you can see, literally.

Weeks passed, and as I struggled to concentrate on the other work I
had to do, it gradually dawned on me that I was in for a
disappointment.
* brevity :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:28]

The noun brevity means shortness or conciseness. If you give a report
on agriculture in the northern hemisphere in 3 minutes, you have done
it with incredible brevity.

Brevity comes from brevis, which means "brief" in Latin. You can use
brevity for things that are literally short, like the brevity of an
elevator meeting, or the quality of fleetingness, like the brevity of
youth. Brevity is also a style of speaking or writing with economy.
"Brevity is the soul of wit," remarks Polonius in Shakespeare's
"Hamlet," suggesting that witty people know how to make a point
without unnecessary words.

What surprised me was its brevity, its utter lack of personal warmth.
* dunce                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:29]

A dunce is a dummy — someone who isn't smart. You might be tempted to
call your little brother a dunce when he walks out the door with his
shoes on the wrong feet.

It's not nice to call someone a dunce, though you might call yourself
one when you study the wrong chapter before a big history test or get
pulled over for yet another speeding ticket. The word dunce comes from
a thirteenth century Scottish philosopher, John Duns Scotus, whose
resistance to new ideas and mystical beliefs inspired opponents to
equate his followers, the "Duns disciples," to "dullards." Later, some
teachers made children wear pointed paper "dunce caps" when they
misbehaved.

It was an embarrassing document, a letter written by dunces, and once
my hurt began to wear off a little, I felt ashamed of myself for
having misjudged them so thoroughly.
* bound :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:30]

To bound is to jump or hop — usually as you run. Bound can also mean
to go or to plan to go, especially to a certain destination, as in
being bound for New York or homeward-bound.

Superman can "leap tall buildings in a single bound," but the word
bound is usually about boundaries. When you're playing soccer or
football, the ball goes "out of bounds." Someone can also be bound
with rope — tied up. Commitments are another kind of tie. When you get
married, you're bound to your partner. If you make a promise, you're
bound to your word. On a less pleasant note, if you're constipated,
you're bound up.

Until I had exhausted all the possibilities, I felt
duty bound to continue, to see the whole misbegotten business
through to the end.
* misbegotten :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:31]

Someone who's misbegotten is born to two parents who aren't legally
married. In the past, being misbegotten was quite embarrassing.

The adjective misbegotten, which commonly means "badly planned," used
to have another use: a derogatory way to describe someone born "out of
wedlock," or to unmarried parents. It's an extremely old fashioned way
to use the word, coined in the 1500s, but you may come across it in a
book, describing a pitiful, misbegotten heroine for example. It comes
from the equally obsolete misbeget, from the literary definition of
beget, "give birth," or "parent."

Until I had exhausted all the possibilities, I felt duty bound to
continue, to see the whole misbegotten business through to the end.
* umpteen :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:34]

Use this informal word when you want to emphasize a large but vague
quantity. If you get umpteen text messages from your friend reminding
you to return the sweatshirt you borrowed, you know she really wants
it back.

Use umpteen when you have so many of something that it's not even
worth counting them. It's kind of like saying "a zillion." If the
smell of your dirty gym clothes is wafting into the hallway, your
parents might complain, "We have told you umpteen times to clean up
your room!" Umpteen started as World War I Army slang, from umpty
which means either "of an indefinite number" or "dash" in Morse code.

They went with the Olympic decathlon champion
instead, and for the next umpteen years, every box of Wheaties was
adorned with a picture of Bruce Jenner’s smiling face.
* twinge :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:34]

A twinge is a sting or pang of pain that happens suddenly. Are you
recovering from a basketball injury? You may still feel a twinge of
discomfort in your knee when you do a layup.

You can experience a physically painful twinge, but there are also
twinges that are more emotional, like the twinge of sadness you feel
when you look at photos of your old house. Use this word as a verb,
too, if you like: "Did your shoulders twinge when you gave your little
brother a piggyback ride?" Long ago, to twinge meant to pinch, and the
word's origin traces back to the Old English twengan, "to pinch."

I never found out how close
George came to getting his idea through, but I must confess
(somewhat reluctantly) that I still find it hard to look at a box of
Wheaties without feeling a little twinge.

* streamlined :Vanessa:
[2020-09-07 Mon 18:04]

Something that works better because it's been made more efficient or
modern is streamlined. Your streamlined system for printing flyers
advertising your yard sale means you can print them much faster than
before.

There are two ways to use the adjective streamlined. First, there's
the simplified system, like a streamlined health care system or a
streamlined driver's license process. The second meaning is "sleek" or
"aerodynamic." The streamlined shape of a bullet train means it can
travel much faster than older, rectangular train cars. The original
meaning of streamline, from the 1850's, was "line drawn from point to
point, so that its direction is everywhere that of the motion of the
fluid."

We have streamlined all of our best findings into a universal framework
that makes up this book.
* tick :Vanessa:
[2020-09-07 Mon 18:05]

To tick is to make a steady tapping sound. When something ticks — be
it a clock, a watch, an oven timer, or a metronome — it’s usually a
reminder that time is passing.

The verb tick originally meant "to touch or pat." The current meaning
may be related to the sound of a hand patting or tapping a surface.
Another kind of tick is a small blood-sucking parasite. This nastier
tick has a different root, the Old English ticia.

If you know exactly what
makes people tick, you can optimize your behavior, interactions, and
relationships.
* eerily                                                  :Vanessa:rare_word:
[2020-09-07 Mon 18:06]


As diverse as we all seem on the outside, our inner workings are quite
similar—if not eerily predictable.
* peeled                                                  :Vanessa:rare_word:
[2020-09-07 Mon 18:08]

You can also keep your eyes peeled for Fast Facts, where we pulled in data
from our Twitter polls and online surveys that are relevant to the content.
* debacle :Vanessa:
[2020-09-08 Tue 13:29]

Use debacle to refer to a fiasco, disaster, or great failure. If
several dogs run onto the field during the big baseball game, tripping
players and chewing up the bases, you can call the whole event a
debacle.

Debacle is sometimes used to describe a military defeat. If your army
retreats, that's one thing. If your army is outmaneuvered and ends up
huddled in a valley, surrounded on all sides by the enemy, forced to
sing 70s sitcom theme songs by their savage captors––that's a debacle.
Debacle comes from French débâcler "to clear," from Middle French
desbacler, from the prefix des- "completely, utterly" plus bacler "to
block."

"the economic debacle that became known as the Great Depression"
* startling :Vanessa:
[2020-09-08 Tue 13:40]

Something that's startling is so unexpected that it shocks or
surprises you. It would be startling to open your front door and see a
clown standing there.

Startling events or circumstances aren't necessarily frightening,
though they can be. A surprise party, if it's planned right, is
startling, and it can be startling the first time you meet your best
friend's identical twin sister. Alarm clocks, smoke alarms, and
barking dogs can all be equally startling. They startle you — and
startle comes from start, with its Old English root styrtan, "to leap
up."

Debacle, I thought it is rather startling.
* flair :Vanessa:
[2020-09-09 Wed 09:11]

Use the word flair to refer to someone’s knack or natural talent for
something. Someone might have a flair for throwing fantastic parties,
or a flair for solving complex math problems.

Something or someone with flair is flashy, catchy and full of energy.
But oddly enough, flair meant "odor" when it originated in the mid
14th century. It wasn’t until 1925 that the word came to mean a
distinctive talent, elegant style or dashing ability. So maybe think
of someone absolutely reeking of style and panache — but in a good
way.

And such people, such deep narcissists, can actually go pretty far in
life, because as children they developed of lot of flair and charisma.
* tacit :Vanessa:
[2020-09-09 Wed 09:49]

Something tacit is implied or understood without question. Holding
hands might be a tacit acknowledgment that a boy and girl are dating.

The adjective tacit refers to information that is understood without
needing to acknowledge it. For example, since we know that the sky is
blue, that kind of assumption is tacit. Lawyers talk about "tacit
agreements," where parties give their silent consent and raise no
objections.

So people who are millennials, you have a kind of tacit understanding.
* floe :Vanessa:
[2020-09-09 Wed 09:49]

An ice floe is a large, free-floating, flat chunk of ice floating in
the ocean. Beware: if you're at the North Pole, you could get stranded
on an ice floe along with polar bears and other arctic creatures.

A floe can vary in size from small to giant, but they differ from
icebergs in their relative lack of depth. When you spot an iceberg,
it’s often just the tip of what’s there, but with a floe, what you see
is what you get. The floe edge is where the ice that is still attached
to the land, having frozen over the winter months, meets the sea. When
the floe edge fractures, the ice floe floats out to sea.

So he had to order all of his men off the ship and onto this ice floe.
* quinsy                                                  :Vanessa:rare_word:
[2020-09-09 Wed 10:50]

His conditioned worsened and late in the evening on December 14, 1799,
George Washington died of quinsy.
* discontent :Vanessa:
[2020-09-09 Wed 10:50]

When you experience discontent, you're not happy. You've been let down
— either by others or by yourself.

The word discontent is made up of dis, meaning "not," and content, "a
state of peaceful happiness." So as an adjective, discontent means
"not happy or peaceful," like the discontent Egyptian citizens who
expressed their dissatisfaction with their country's leader by
protesting and demanding he give up power. As a verb, discontent means
"to make unhappy," like bad news that discontents you.

I would slowly direct their attention away from the boss and the job,
and instead get them to search inside themselves and try to find the
emotional root of their discontent.
