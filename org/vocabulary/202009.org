* impromptu                                                            :misc:

Some of the best kinds of parties are impromptu ones, when you decide
at the last minute to get together. The adjective impromptu describes
things done or said without previous thought or preparation.

Impromptu is also used as an adverb: Most people are not able to speak
impromptu in front of an audience. This word was borrowed from French
and ultimately derives from the Latin in prōmptū ("at hand, in
readiness") from in ("in") plus a form of prōmptus ("readiness"). As
you can guess from the spelling, the adjective and verb prompt are
related to impromptu; they are from the same Latin verb, prōmere, "to
bring forth."

She came scurrying over to our table, and Monsieur X bought a dozen
roses, which he handed to my girlfriend as an impromptu gift.
* scuttle                                                              :Hand:

When you scuttle, you move with quick anxious steps, like a bug
running for cover when a light is turned on.

Use the word scuttle when you want to describe running or fast walking
that’s characterized by short, hasty steps, like someone or something
that tries to hurry — a person who is late for work scuttling through
a crowd of slow-moving pedestrians — but can't. It is also found in
these well-known lines from T.S. Eliot's poem "The Love Song of J.
Alfred Prufrock": "I should have been a pair of ragged claws /
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas."

Not a penny of aid emerged from that gruesome evening, but he went
ahead and started improvising a new plan, scuttling his dream of
theatrical glory for a more modest, workable approach.
* gruesome                                                             :Hand:

Gothic novels, horror movies, and crime dramas don't shy away from
showing gruesome scenes of death, pictures that inspire fright and
repulsion. Synonyms include "ghastly," "grisly," "loathsome," and
"macabre."

Once upon a time, English contained a variety of words related to
gruesome. The verb grue meant "to shudder," just as its Middle Dutch
source gruwen did. Grueful and grueing also conveyed the sense of
shivering with horror and disgust. All of these variations have been
lost leaving us only with gruesome. Texting while driving has caused
many gruesome accidents that you might not want to hear the gruesome
details of. Although if you like gruesome movies, you might want to
know.

Not a penny of aid emerged from that gruesome evening, but he went
ahead and started improvising a new plan, scuttling his dream of
theatrical glory for a more modest, workable approach.
* undaunted                                                            :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:38]

If you're undaunted, you're not afraid or intimidated. As a great
surfer, you remain undaunted as you seek out dangerous waters to ride
the biggest waves.

The adjective undaunted was first used in the mid-15th century to
describe horses that were "untamed, not broken in." These horses must
have seemed wildly fearless and intrepid even in the most difficult
situations. Similarly, an undaunted person remains courageous and bold
when facing fear, difficulty, and danger. Paramedics and firemen are
undaunted when faced with a burning building. You must remain
undaunted when facing your terrifying calculus homework.

A lesser man would have given up after such a defeat, but John was
undaunted.
* lesser                                                               :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:39]

Use the adjective lesser to describe something that's smaller than or
inferior to something else. A lesser singer might sound fine in the
context of a large chorus, but a solo performance could be tricky.

A young car thief might be charged with a lesser crime because of his
age — trespassing instead of larceny, for example. He's also likely to
end up with a lesser punishment in that case. Sometimes people talk
about "the lesser of two evils," by which they mean the less bad of
two bad choices, or describe something as "lesser-known," like a
rarely studied poet or an unacknowledged scientist.

A lesser man would have given up after such a defeat, but John was
undaunted.
* blurt                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:40]

If you blurt something out, you're speaking abruptly and without
thinking about what you're saying.

Usually, when you blurt something, you end up regretting it. Saying
something without considering your words can end up making you feel
stupid or hurting someone's feelings — just imagine what might happen
if you were to blurt out what you really think about your
grandmother's cooking. The best thing about the word blurt is that
it's onomatopoeic, or a word that sounds exactly like what it means.

Finally, apropos of nothing, I blurted out some lame excuse and left.
* perfunctory                                                          :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:41]

Perfunctory means done as part of a routine or duty. If you give
someone a gift and they look at it like it's roadkill and say nothing
but a perfunctory "thank you," you might not be giving them another
one anytime soon.

A person who does something in a perfunctory way shows little
enthusiasm or interest in what they are doing. Many of our everyday
greetings are perfunctory. For example, when we say "Hello" and "How
are you?", we usually do so out of habit. Perfunctory is from Latin
perfunctus, from perfungi, "to get through with, perform," formed from
the Latin prefix per-, "completely," plus fungi, "to perform."

At the end, after some grim, perfunctory applause, I could only think
about how to get out of there and hide.
* titter                                                               :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:41]

A titter is an awkward laugh at something that you shouldn’t be
laughing at, like during dinner when Uncle Marvin makes a joke about
your mother’s new hairstyle. If you try to hide your laugh, it’s
probably a titter.

A laugh that you can’t keep in but also can’t let out, that’s a
titter. It usually happens in situations where you shouldn’t be
laughing, like listening to your English teacher talk about a date he
went on the night before, or when someone tells you a joke in a
library. A titter is kinder than a snicker, less noticeable than a
giggle, quieter than a chuckle, and way less fun than a chortle.
Life’s a joke, laugh it up!

Lines that I had imagined were funny did not produce the faintest
titter.
* thud                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:42]

To thud is to make the loud sound of something heavy hitting or
falling. Tip your chair too far back and your body may thud against
the floor.

Throw an egg off a balcony onto the pavement below, and it will splat,
but throw a heavy dumbbell off the same balcony and it will thud — you
can call the sound it makes a thud as well. The verb originally meant
"to strike, stab, or thrust," from the Old English imitative word
þyddan, and the noun was used to mean "blast of wind" in the early
sixteenth century.

The play thudded forward, and from start to finish the rich people sat
in silence, utterly unmoved.
* blistering                                                           :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:42]

Use the adjective blistering to mean extremely hot. You might love
living in Georgia, except for the blistering heat in the summer time.

A baker has to remove her loaves of bread carefully from the oven
because of the blistering heat. You can also use blistering to mean a
different kind of heat: "Her blistering criticism took him by
surprise." Or a racer might set out on a track at a blistering pace,
one that's incredibly fast or impressive. The original, hot meaning of
blistering comes from the idea that something is "hot enough to form
blisters."

The alcohol had precisely the opposite effect, and by the time the
reading started, I had come down with a massive headache, a
blistering, brain-bending assault that grew ever more unbearable as
the evening wore on.
* finality                                                             :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:43]

Finality is the absolute, definite end. People often speak of the
finality of death — nothing comes after it and nothing that came
before it can be changed.

If someone speaks with absolute finality, he is not going to change
his mind. The sound of a judge's gavel slamming down gives a sense of
finality to his or her judgment. Because of its association with death
and closure, finality often carries a somber undertone. It can also be
used in conjunction with the end of a sports season. But even the
finality of the seventh game of a classic World Series is usually
forgotten by the time spring training rolls around.

He was counting on the play to seduce them, to overwhelm their hearts
and minds with such stunning finality that they would feel no choice
but to reach into their pockets and start pulling out their
checkbooks.
* overwhelm                                                            :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:43]

Overwhelm means “give a person too much of something.” If your friend
agrees to feed your pet fish while you’re on vacation, don’t overwhelm
her with requests by also asking her to do your laundry and wash the
dishes.

While it’s easy to be overwhelmed by chores or complaints, it’s also
possible to be overwhelmed by good things — if they occur in large
quantities. You might enjoy a stack of pancakes for breakfast, but
you'd probably find a truckload of pancakes overwhelming. Sometimes
people feel overwhelmed by emotion, and this can be a positive or
negative experience, depending on the emotion. For example, you might
feel overwhelmed by gratitude if your friend takes excellent care of
your fish, but overwhelmed with grief if the fish is accidentally
flushed in your absence.

He was counting on the play to seduce them, to overwhelm their hearts
and minds with such stunning finality that they would feel no choice
but to reach into their pockets and start pulling out their
checkbooks.
* indestructible                                                       :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:44]

Something that's indestructible can't be broken or destroyed. Your
indestructible winter boots last year after year, stomping through
snow and ice and salt without ever falling apart.

Things that are indestructible last for so long that it seems
impossible to break them. Your relationship with your best friend
might feel indestructible if your bond is strong and true, and your
junky old car might also seem indestructible if it never dies no
matter how many miles you drive it. The word indestructible comes from
Latin roots, the prefix in, or "not," and destruere, "tear down or
demolish" or literally "un-build."

John jumped in with his customary excitement and energy, but things
kept going wrong, and after a while it began to seem that we weren’t
putting on a play so much as trying to prove the indestructible power
of Murphy’s Law.
* customary                                                            :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:44]

Something customary is done according to practice. When a bride walks
down the aisle, it's customary for everyone at the wedding to rise out
of respect.

Every culture has its own customary traditions. In American culture
it's customary for a child who loses a tooth to put it under her
pillow and wait for the Tooth Fairy to arrive. In Greece, on the other
hand, it's customary to throw a child's lost tooth onto the roof for
good luck. Customary can also reference habitual things a person does,
like taking your shoes off when you come home, or writing in your
diary before bed.

John jumped in with his customary excitement and energy, but things
kept going wrong, and after a while it began to seem that we weren’t
putting on a play so much as trying to prove the indestructible power
of Murphy’s Law.
* spare                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:45]

Spare describes something that is extra. If you have a spare tire for
your bike you can replace a flat, and if there's enough change in your
pocket you can spare some to patch a friend's tire.

As a noun, a verb, and an adjective, the word spare has many meanings.
A leftover part is a spare, you can spare a life when you save an
animal or person, and you have spare time when you finish a project
early. If you "spare no expense" you spend lots of money and when you
spare a friend's feelings, you keep upsetting details to yourself. And
if you have a moment to spare, you have time to share.

As far as I was concerned, they were hardly more than spare,
minimalist exercises, an initial stab at something that might or might
not turn out to be real.
* surge                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:45]

A surge is a sudden strong swelling, like a tsunami wave that engulfs
the land. Although a surge offers a fluid image, anything can
experience a sudden surge, including emotions, political support, or
an angry mob.

The original Latin word surgere, meaning “to spring up or rise,”
serves as the basis for the word surge, which refers to a great sudden
growth or swelling. If you are watching a sad movie and you experience
a sudden surge of emotion, do you quietly reach for a tissue, pretend
something's in your eye, or simply weep and sob with reckless abandon?
Yeah, me too. Christmas shopping can be dangerous when there is a
surge of interest in one toy and desperate shoppers surge into stores
trying to grab it up.

The pieces had surged up unexpectedly, and the results were quite
different from anything I had done before.


* frantic                                                              :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:46]

When a mother loses her child, she's frantic. She's a crazed sort of
agitated and goes on a frantic search for her child. A scene is
frantic if there's lots of action with little order.

Frantic is related to frenzy and both were originally ways to describe
mental illness. Hundreds of years ago, if you were frantic, you were
stark raving mad. Today, frantic implies fast wild movements or a
desperate attempt to do something. On Christmas Eve, the scene at the
mall was frantic with shoppers desperately searching for their last
few gifts. And a wild party would only be called frantic if the police
were called and everyone rushed to get away.

We weren’t flush enough to stop translating, but the pace was less
frantic now, and that allowed me to spend more time with my own work.
* sublet                                                               :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:46]

When you rent an apartment by taking over another person's lease,
instead of renting directly from a landlord, you sublet. You can also
say the person sublets the apartment to you.

As a noun, sublet refers both to the lease agreement and to the
property itself: "I'm living in a tiny sublet right next to the train
tracks." The formal, legal word for this is sublease, but it's more
common for renters to use the informal sublet instead. Being able to
sublet to another person makes it possible for a renter to leave an
apartment without breaking their lease.

We sublet our apartment and went to the Laurentian Mountains in
Quebec, holing up in the house of a painter friend for a couple of
months while he was away, then returned to New York for a week or two,
and then promptly packed our bags again and took a cross-country train
to San Francisco.
* stir                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:47]

To stir is to mix something up. You can literally stir cake batter
with a spoon, or figuratively stir someone's emotions by writing them
a heartfelt letter.

You can stir muffin batter with a wooden spoon, and stir in a cup of
blueberries. When people stir, they start to move after being still or
asleep: "It was only five o'clock, but he could hear the kids start to
stir." And when something stirs you, it brings up some emotion: "That
music always stirs up my sad memories." Stir shares a root with the
Old Norse styrr, "tumult or disturbance."

In the endnotes to Parenthèse 4, for example, buried among the dry
accounts of contributors’ past achievements, he took it upon himself
to declare that “Paul Auster has created a stir in the literary world
by his brilliant analysis of the work of Laura Riding Jackson, by his
essays on French paintings, and his poetry.”
* sleeve                                                               :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:49]

The part of your clothing that covers your arm (or part of your arm)
is a sleeve. Some t-shirts have long sleeves, others have short
sleeves, and your tank top doesn't have any sleeves at all.

On a hot day, you might roll up the sleeves of your shirt, or you
might change into one with short sleeves (or no sleeves at all, also
known as sleeveless). Another kind of sleeve is a container or
protective covering, like a record sleeve or a sleeve of crackers. If
you have something "up your sleeve," it means you're hiding something
to use later in a surprising way.

This John was all enthusiasm and goodwill, a man who had dedicated his
life to beautiful things, and he wore his heart on his sleeve.
* mincing                                                              :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:49]

Mincing is an adjective that describes someone who is being especially
dainty or refined. The voices of older women who speak as though
they're young girls can be described as mincing.

Mincing is primarily used as an adjective meaning to be noticeably —
and perhaps oddly or unnaturally — dainty or refined. You might
remark, for example, on a lumberjack who takes mincing steps across a
log, or a woman who speaks to her dog in a mincing voice. In these
cases, the daintiness is unnatural — it's put on for show — or in the
case of the lumberjack, so he won't fall off the log.

This John, however, in that he was proudly and flagrantly homosexual,
in that he gleefully mocked himself with all manner of mincing
gestures and extravagant poses, in that he took delight in silly jokes
and ridiculous songs and a whole repertoire of childish humor, had
nothing to do with that other John.


* flagrantly                                                           :Hand:

This John, however, in that he was proudly and
flagrantly homosexual, in that he gleefully mocked himself with all
manner of mincing gestures and extravagant poses, in that he took
delight in silly jokes and ridiculous songs and a whole repertoire
of childish humor, had nothing to do with that other John.


* gleefully                                                            :Hand:

When you do something gleefully, you do it in an extremely happy way.
If two kids call to each other gleefully across the playground,
there's laughter and delight in their voices.

Wedding guests might rush gleefully onto the dance floor when the DJ
plays a popular song, and a child who is trick or treating for the
first time will often gleefully dress in her ghost costume and even
more gleefully watch her plastic pumpkin fill with Halloween candy.
The adjective gleeful and related noun glee are at the root of
gleefully, all of them sharing the Latin root word gliu,
"entertainment, mirth, jest, or play."

This John, however, in that he was proudly and flagrantly homosexual,

* effusive                                                             :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:51]

Getting a compliment from your effusive Aunt Sally can be a little
embarrassing. Since she's so effusive, Aunt Sally holds nothing back,
gushing with enthusiasm.

The adjective effusive means "extravagantly demonstrative," and if you
know someone who expresses positive emotions in a heartfelt, bubbly
way, you understand just what the word means. The word effusive has a
surprisingly similar definition in geology; it describes a particular
kind of volcanic eruption, one in which lava bubbles up out of the
volcano and flows around it.

I don’t think I’ve ever known a funnier or more effusive person than
John.
* hunch                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:51]

When you pose for pictures with short friends, you hunch over so you
don't tower above them — you scrunch up your shoulders, bend your
knees, and try to look smaller.

You can also have a hunch, which has nothing to do with scrunching.
When you have a hunch about something, you think it might be true.
Your dog bolts over the fence, and you have a hunch he's heading for
the neighbor who feeds him pâté. Hunch is an odd word of unknown
origin, which seems to have originally meant "to push or shove" — to
nudge.

At the next semiannual meeting, John’s hunch proved to be correct.


* dole                                                                 :Hand:

A committee met every six months to consider new applications and to

[2020-09-01 Tue 14:52]


A publisher would hand us a book, we would split the work in two
(literally tearing the book in half if we had only one copy), and set
a daily quota for ourselves.


* downright                                                            :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:53]

The adjective downright is used to emphasize something, or to mean
"utterly." For example, you could say that your brother's loud and
junky old car is a downright embarrassment.

Downright works as an adjective or adverb, so you can describe your
dad's brownies as downright delicious, your sister's terrible jokes as
downright awful, or your loss of the spelling bee as a downright
disgrace. In the thirteenth century, downright meant "straight down,"
but it had changed by 1300, to instead mean "thoroughly."

Except for one book by Sartre (Life/Situations, a collection of essays
and interviews), the books the publishers gave us were dull,
undistinguished works that ranged in quality from not very good to
downright bad.
* piety                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:54]

Piety is devotion to God or to religious practices. Nuns who pray all
day long are famous for their piety. If you have filial piety it means
you're devoted to your parents.

Piety is sometimes used in a disapproving way to mean that the person
is only pretending to be devoted or good. It was borrowed from the
French word pieté, meaning "piety or pity," ultimately from the Latin
pius, "devoted, kind." This Latin adjective is also the source of our
English adjective pious.

With all the pieties floating around the art world, I found it
refreshing to hear him say that.
* credulity                                                            :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:54]

Did you know that if you say credulity ten times fast it starts to
sound like orange? If you believe that, then you have a lot of
credulity. Credulity means gullibility, or a willingness to believe
anything.

Credulity is a tendency to believe in things too easily and without
evidence. If a swindler is trying to sell you fake medicine, then he
is "preying on your credulity." This noun is associated with being
naïve, gullible or innocent. It shouldn’t be confused with
credibility, which means “believability,” although it is often misused
in this way. You might hear someone say, “the farfetched plot of that
movie strained credulity,” but what he or she really means is
“believability,” or “credibility.”

The common theme in the stories was deception, after all, playing
people for fools, and from the way he laughed when he told them—as if
gloating, as if reveling in his own cynicism—I felt that perhaps he
was only toying with me, buttering me up with compliments in order to
test the limits of my credulity.
* buttering                                                            :Hand:

Butter is a creamy spread made from milk fat. Your favorite breakfast
might be hot toast slathered with butter.

The process of making butter involves churning cream until the fats
coagulate and become creamy and pale yellow. Butter is sometimes
salted, and usually formed into sticks for cooks to use in frying,
baking, and spreading on corn on the cob and baked goods. To do this
is to butter your bread. The Greek root word is boutyron, literally
"cow cheese," from bous, "cow."

* awestruck                                                            :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:55]

To be awestruck is to be full of complete wonder, amazement, or dread
for something. Swimming with a humpback whale or being near a tornado
would leave most people awestruck. When you're awestruck, you're
amazed.

Awestruck literally means to be struck with awe — a feeling of
profound amazement. You can be awestruck by something surprising,
wonderful, or even scary. Imagine the breathless feeling you’d get
swimming next to a whale! That’s awestruck. This is a very powerful
feeling that would never apply to everyday things. Being awestruck
leaves you stunned. You can't quite believe what you're seeing or
hearing.

Or how, occasionally, he would turn up at expensive restaurants

house by the awestruck maître d’—without a reservation, without a tip,
without so much as a glance.

A sham is a fake. If you frequently order products advertised on
late-night, hour-long television commercials, you’ve probably ended up
with at least one item that was a sham. All-purpose, industrial
strength stain remover, anyone?

Sham can be used to refer to people as well as to things. Remember
that doctor from the late-night TV commercial advertising
UltraMiracleCure vitamin pills? He’s probably a sham, or a quack. Some
sources claim that the word sham originated in the 17th century and
was derived from the English word shame, but who knows? Maybe that
theory’s a sham too.

[2020-09-01 Tue 14:56]

Manic means frenzied. If you drink 18 cups of coffee in a single
sitting and haven't slept for three days, chances are you're manic.

If manic sounds like maniac to you, you're on the right track. Someone
who is in a manic state is affected by mania. If you're manic you're
in a wound-up, fast-acting, unhinged wild state. People with bi-polar
disorder experience manic highs and terrible lows. Other things can be
manic, too, like the pace of city life or the flabmoyant outfit you're
wearing with seven different colors and eight different patterns.

He was so thoroughly high-strung, so odd and manic in his behavior,

* drag                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:56]

To drag something means to physically pull it, like when you drag your
sofa to the other side of the living room in order to get a better
view of the TV.

Drag can also mean to prolong something. In this case, drag is often
followed by the words "out" or "on." You could describe a class that
drags on for hours, or try to drag out your homework to get out of
doing the dishes. You can also drag someone unwillingly into a
discussion or other situation. Anything that's boring and tedious can
also be called a drag — like lunches with your great aunt Martha or
cleaning the bathroom.

If left to my own devices, I could have completed the work in one or
two days, but because Kosinski wouldn’t let the manuscript out of his
house, I had to go to his apartment on West Fifty-seventh Street to do
the work, and because he hovered around me constantly, interrupting me
every twenty minutes with stories, anecdotes, and nervous chatter, the
job dragged on for seven days.

A hover craft flies low over the ground or water — it hovers. Hover
can also mean waver. Think of someone that can’t decide exactly where
to land.

To help remember the meaning of hover, think of it as containing the
preposition over: things that hover hang over. A temperature can hover
around forty degrees, a grade in a class can hover around a B.

* emanate                                                              :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 14:57]

Emanate means to give off, like the sound of laughter that emanates
from your sister's room during her slumber party. If spooky sounds
emanate from the closet, don’t open the door!

The word emanate comes from the Latin emanare, which means “to flow
out.” Things that emanate come from somewhere. Heat emanates from a
fire, and smoke emanates from a chimney. This word can also be used
figuratively: for example, you might say that your upbeat and
optimistic best friend emanates positivity.

Intense controversy has surrounded Kosinski in recent years, and since
a large share of it emanated from the novel I worked on (Cockpit), I
feel that I should add my testimony to the record.

A controversy is a dispute or argument in which people express strong
opposing views. When a popular TV show kills off a well-loved
character, there's bound to be a lot of controversy.

Controversy means a quarrel (often public) involving strong
disagreement, but the topic can be as unimportant as a new movie.
There might be a controversy in the pages of fashion magazines over
whether shorter hems are really in style, or about wearing white after
Labor Day. Controversy is from the Latin contrōversus, "turned in an
opposite direction," from the prefix contrā, "against," plus versus, a
form of vertere, "to turn."

a large share of it emanated from the novel I worked on (Cockpit), I

* crafty                                                               :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:02]

If people call you crafty, they probably mean you are sly and a little
deceptive. Then again, they could be saying that you are really good
at knitting, beading, and turning old t-shirts into funky pillowcases.

The adjective crafty comes from the Old English word cræftig, which
meant “strong” or “powerful,” but the meaning of crafty these days has
to do with being skilled at getting what you want through manipulation
or trickery. Dickens’ Artful Dodger, the con-man from Oliver Twist, is
crafty. Handmade items, and sometimes the people who make them, can
also be called crafty, like your crafty sister who always makes you
unique birthday gifts.

Arthur took pleasure in turning a profit, enjoyed the push and pull of
running the enterprise and making it succeed, and while he was also a
man of great sophistication and refinement, a genuine intellectual who

fact that he was a crafty entrepreneur.
* genuine                                                              :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:03]

Genuine things are true or authentic. When you're talking about
people, being genuine has to do with being sincere.

This word has to do with things and people that are true. A genuine
blonde is a real blonde — no hair dye involved. A genuine friend is a
real friend you can trust when the chips are down. Genuine feelings
are real feelings — not fake feelings put on as a show. A genuine
hundred dollar bill is the real McCoy, not a counterfeit bill. When
something is the real thing, it's genuine.

[2020-09-01 Tue 15:03]

Measly is a great word for describing an amount or number so small
that it's ridiculous. You'll be disappointed (and maybe even annoyed)
if you're paid a measly six dollars to babysit a toddler for two
hours.

If you've got a measly ten minutes to eat lunch between classes, it's
a laughably short amount of time — hardly enough to unwrap your tuna
sandwich. And when a detective has a measly number of clues to help
her solve a crime, it can seem nearly impossible. This informal word
comes from British slang, and it originally meant "affected by
measles."

The difference between us was not that I understood the issues any
better than he did (if anything, it was just the opposite), but that
he was a businessman and I wasn’t, which explained why he was the boss
and I made just a few measly dollars per hour.


* fondle                                                               :Hand:

[2020-09-01 Tue 15:05]

When you swathe yourself in a blanket, you are wrapping or swaddling
yourself up in it. Swathe a baby up and you're creating a little
cocoon where she can sleep.

Sometimes spelled "swath," swathe is commonly used to talk about how
you wrap up a baby in a soft blanket. The verb can also refer to
binding a wound with bandages; as a noun, a swathe is a long strip or
bandage to protect a wound. Swathe derives from an Old English word,
swaþian, which means "to wrap."

When you sit down to write about the catalogue that Marcel Duchamp
designed for the 1947 Surrealist exhibition in Paris, for example—the
one with the rubber breast on the cover, the celebrated bare falsie
that came with the admonition “Prière de Toucher” (“Please Touch”)—and
you find that catalogue protected by several layers of bubble wrap,
which in turn have been swathed in thick brown paper, which in turn
has been slipped into a plastic bag, you can’t help but pause for a
moment and wonder if you aren’t wasting your time.
* reverence                                                            :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:05]

Reverence is a feeling of deep respect or awe — like what you have for
a president, a hero, or a favorite football player.

Reverence can be a feeling of awe, and it can also describe how you
treat someone, particularly when used with the word with. To treat
someone "with reverence" is to show them intense respect. Your friends
may respect you for your loyalty, though they probably do not bow to
you with reverence every day.

I enjoyed looking through the material I had to write about, but I
didn’t have the mind of a collector, and I could never bring myself to
feel the proper awe or reverence for the things we sold.
* rein                                                                 :Hand:

Rein is both a noun and a verb for guiding and restraining. You can
use the long strap, or rein, on a horse to control its speed and
direction, and you can rein in your own tongue by closing your mouth.

Rein rhymes with rain but the two words describe very different
things. Rain comes down all over the place, uncontrolled, while a rein
holds things in place or controls what comes out. As a noun, rein is
often used as a plural word "reins" when talking about actual leather
restraints used in horse riding, but a rein also is something
non-physical like when you put a rein on spending by shopping less.

There was a certain fusty precision to the work (measuring the books,
examining them for imperfections, detailing provenances when
necessary), but many of the items were quite thrilling to hold, and
Arthur gave me free rein to express my opinions about them, even to
inject an occasional dose of humor if I felt like it.

Where something comes from is its provenance. If a style of music
originated in the capital of Rhode Island, you could say that its
provenance was Providence.

Some items of foreign provenance are taxed more heavily than domestic
products. If you claim that an artwork put up for sale was stolen from
your family's art collection, an investigation may be ordered to
resolve issues of provenance. In this case, provenance refers to who
has the legal right to the specific work of art, or to whom it
belongs.

Use the adjective fusty to describe something that's covered with dust
and smells a little old and musty. Your grandmother's attic is
probably full of fusty knickknacks.

Fusty is perfect for describing anything from a slightly mildewed
quilt at the back of your closet to your brother's camping gear,
forgotten in the trunk of his car for months and smelling a little
ripe. You can also use it to talk about an antique idea or attitude,
like your uncle's fusty, outdated opinions on the roles of men and
women. The Old French root of fusty is fusté, "tasting or smelling of
the cask," from fuist, "wine cask."

* shrine                                                               :Hand:

Set up some candles and a photograph of someone important in your life
in the corner of a room where you spend time reflecting silently, and
you've created a shrine.

Shrine comes from the Latin scrinium meaning "case or box for keeping
papers." Think of a shrine as a niche or case in which the spirit of
someone special is kept. It could be a statue or some other form of
commemoration to either a person or a relic. A shrine can be as small
as a tiny mantel in your house or it can be as massive as a building
commemorating, or shrining, a sacred person.

I spent four or five hours there every afternoon, and it was a bit
like working in a museum, a small shrine to the avant-garde.

Part hobbyhorse, part serious commercial venture, Ex Libris was a
rare-book concern that specialized in publications connected with
twentieth-century art.


* vow                                                                  :Hand:

To vow is to make an earnest promise or pledge. People getting married
often vow to stick together “till death do us part,” while a
presidential candidate might vow to lower taxes.

You can use vow as both a noun and a verb: A vow is a solemn
declaration; to vow is the act of making that promise. Vows are meant
to be serious, sacred things, even vows made with the best intentions
can be broken. Wrote American short-story writer and poet Dorothy
Parker, “By the time you swear you are his, shivering and sighing, And
he vows his passion is infinite and undying—Lady, make a note of this:
One of you is lying.”

I had vowed to swallow my medicine, but just when the spoon was coming
toward me, I shut my mouth.
* opt                                                                  :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:09]

To opt is to choose. Given the alternative, most kids will opt for a
cupcake over a ham sandwich.

When you're signing up for next semester's classes, you might opt for
another history class, or instead opt for advanced biology. Whenever
you have more than one alternative, you have the chance to opt for
something. You can also opt out of something, or choose not to do it
at all. Opt comes from the French verb opter, "to choose," from the
Latin root optare, "desire," and it's related to option.

It’s not that I didn’t find a job, but rather than accept the
full-time position I had been offered (as junior editor in a large
publishing house), I opted for a half-time job at half the pay.
* squeeze                                                              :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:09]

When you squeeze something, you put pressure on it. If you squeeze
your toothpaste from the bottom up, you'll get the most out of your
tube.

The word squeeze has to do with force or pressure. When you squeeze
something, like an orange, you are crushing it to extract juice. When
you squeeze into a pair of jeans, you're forcing yourself into them.
When you give someone a squeeze, you're giving them a tight hug. And
when you're in a squeeze, you're in a tight spot, or a bind.

I was trying to act sensibly, and after all the ups and downs I’d been
through, all the tight corners and desperate squeezes that had trapped
me over the years, I was determined not to repeat my old mistakes.
* curb                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:10]

The hard thing about learning how to parallel park is trying to get
the car close enough to the curb without hitting it. A curb is the
edge of the sidewalk beside the road.

When you're using the word curb as a noun, it's the raised edging
beside a street. When curb is a verb, it means to restrain or hold
back, like when you curb your impulse to laugh while watching a badly
acted play. Curb comes from the Latin word for "curve," curvus, which
describes the shape of a restraining strap on a horse's head — in the
fifteenth century, this band was called a curb.

We climbed into the back seat, the driver started up the engine, and
the car pulled away from the curb.
* upholstery                                                           :Hand:

Upholstery refers to the covering on furniture. Without upholstery,
your couch wouldn't be very comfortable.

This is a word specific to furniture, especially the chairs and
couches found in most living rooms. Upholstery consists of the
material — including springs, padding, and fabric — that cover the
bare bones of the furniture you sit on. If you have ever spilled a
drink on a couch, someone might have yelled, "Watch out! You'll stain
the upholstery!" People who put the upholstery on furniture are called
upholsterers.

It was a tan Jaguar with leather upholstery, and the man behind the
wheel was dressed in a white shirt.
* ate away                                                             :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:13]

If you leave an antique flowerpot outside all winter, the snow and
rain might eat the paint, making it look even older than it is.

You probably know that eat means "to consume food," because you do
that several times a day. But we also use the verb eat for other
situations involving using something up or wearing it down. If your
art project eats up all your art supplies, that means you don't have
any left. Leaving your car lights on will eat through your battery.
Something eating away at us is worrying us. Don't let money stress eat
away at your happiness.

The crazy girl kept showing up with one of her friends, a Central
American Hare Krishna with a shaved head and orange robes, and
boredom ate away at me like some tropical disease.
* muslin                                                               :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:14]

Muslin is a kind of cotton fabric that's plain and lightweight.
Designers and dressmakers often use muslin to make inexpensive sample
garments for fitting.

Perfecting designs using muslin is so common that the practice garment
itself is often referred to as a muslin: "Here, try on this muslin
before we cut the pattern out of the silk." The word muslin comes from
the French mousseline, which is rooted in Mosul, the city in Iraq
where Western traders first encountered the fabric. This ancient
muslin was a luxurious material, while today's is much more ordinary
and affordable.

My room was in a stucco outbuilding on the brother’s property, and I
slept under muslin netting to guard against the tarantulas and
mosquitoes.
* stucco                                                               :Hand:

Stucco is a material that's used to coat ceilings, walls, and the
exterior of buildings. If you travel to the southwestern United
States, you'll see many homes with stucco exteriors and terra-cotta
roof tiles.

Stucco is a type of plaster, a substance that goes on as a wet paste
and dries hard. In fact, in Italian, stucco means "plaster," from a
Germanic source it shares with the Old High German stukki, or "crust."
Stucco is mainly decorative, often covering metal or cinderblock, but
it's also a weather-resistant coating. While regular plaster is
usually smooth and white, stucco is most often textured.

* aimless                                                              :Hand:

If you're aimless, you don't have a destination or a goal in mind.
Aimless wandering through a forest might take you in circles, or worse
yet, get you lost.

The adjective aimless is good for describing things that have no
particular purpose or plan. You might prefer traveling with a map or
GPS, while your best friend likes to drive in an aimless way, turning
down dirt roads or exiting the highway impulsively. When you call a
person aimless, you probably mean that he doesn't appear to have any
ambition: "My brother's an aimless drifter." Aimless comes from aim,
"purpose" or "target."

I was staying with Madame X’s brother (whose unhappy marriage to an
American woman was on its last legs), and I filled my days with
aimless walks around the dusty town, stepping over mangy dogs, batting
flies out of my face, and accepting invitations to drink beers with
the local drunks.
* bid                                                                  :Hand:

* quandary                                                             :Hand:

How to define the word quandary? Wow, this is quite a dilemma. What to
do, what to do? Hmmm. Looks like this moment itself is a quandary: a
tough situation that will be really hard to resolve.

If you’re uncertain what to do because all of your options seem
unpleasant, you’re probably in a quandary. Some voters find themselves
in a quandary when they dislike all of the candidates. A more common
quandary is when you plan two events at the same time and can’t decide
which one to attend. Some synonyms are predicament, dilemma, plight,
and pickle — and choosing which word to use is a quandary in itself.

Such was the quandary I found myself in.
* murky                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:16]

Something that's murky is dim, gloomy or hard to see through clearly.
Think of the dark fog around a haunted house or the cloudy, muddy
water in a swamp.

Rarely used before the 17th century, this adjective came about by
adding a "y" to the word murk. Murk itself evolved from myrkr, a Norse
word for "darkness.” Things that are murky are unclear; that goes for
murky, sediment-filled lakes, shady business deals, and arguments that
don't seem to make any sense.

To assume that a book can be written by a person who is not a writer
is already a murky proposition, but granting that such a thing is
possible, and granting that the person who wants to write the book has
someone else to help with the writing of it, perhaps the two of them,
with much hard work and dedication, can arrive at an acceptable
result.
* languish                                                             :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 15:18]

To languish is to become pitiful or weak because you're sick, in love,
or stuck somewhere. A prisoner might languish in jail, longing for her
freedom.

Languish, like languid, is from the Latin word languere which means
"to be weak or faint." Your houseplants might languish in a dark dry
corner. A Romantic poet might languish on a velvet couch with the back
of her hand to her forehead. People in operas love to languish: The
main character in La Traviatta, Violetta, languishes from longing and
eventually tuberculosis.

I wrote one or two short poems, but otherwise I languished, unable to
think, bogged down by a persistent, nameless anxiety.
* tense                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:40]

When something's stretched tight, it's tense. A rope can be tense. So
can a muscle. When a person's tense, they're anxious.

When a situation is tense, you might say you could "cut the tension
with a knife." When a muscle tenses up, it contracts suddenly–-a
person can be said to tense up also. The opposite of tense is
"relaxed." If you tense up during exams, it's probably best to learn
some relaxation techniques. The brain works best when it's relaxed.

When I did manage to find some time for myself, I was too tense to
write very well.
* wound                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:40]

A wound is a serious injury, especially a deep cut through the skin.
But things like pride and feelings can also get wounded.

Wounds are serious: we're talking a lot worse than just a scrape or
booboo. Just about all the meanings of this word have to do with being
hurt. If you got stabbed, you got a stab wound. Soldiers in battle get
a lot of wounds from enemies. If someone told you to shut up, they
might wound your feelings. If you slipped in a puddle in front of your
friends, that might wound your pride.

Months went by, and every piece of paper I touched with my pen wound
up in the garbage.
* tempt                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:42]

To tempt is to lure or entice. You might tempt your runaway dog back
inside with pieces of cheese.

The verb tempt often has negative implications: "Don't let those
bullies tempt you into picking on smaller kids!" When something tempts
you, it's often with the knowledge that it's not the best idea,
however attractive it might be. Tempt was originally a religious term,
meaning "to entice to evil or sin," while today it's more likely to be
a slice of cake that tempts us than the devil.

Now that I lived in a house with a basement, don’t think I wasn’t
tempted.
* back against the wall                                                :Hand:

[2020-09-01 Tue 17:48]

Desperate means "having lost all hope." If you are desperate for food,
it means you are starving, possibly about to die. If you are in a
desperate situation, it means things are really, really bad.

Desperate, desparate, or despirate? The word desperate is misspelled
often enough that it's the despair of English teachers. Both desperate
and despair come from the same Latin verb as despair. Don't mix it up
with disparate, a totally different word that means "distinctive,
different, various."

But I was a desperate man, a man with my back against the wall, and I
knew that if I didn’t think of something fast, the firing squad was
about to fill my body with bullets.
* earnest                                                              :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:49]

If you are earnest, it means you are serious about something. Your
parents might not want you to drop out of school to follow some
fly-by-night dream, but if you're earnest about wanting a career in
show biz, they'll support you.

If you are earnest, you pursue your purpose in a steady, sincere, and
eager way. The phrase in earnest uses earnest as a noun, as in, "Once
you stop fooling around and start studying in earnest, you'll find you
learn the material quickly." Oscar Wilde's classic play The Importance
of Being Earnest plays on the fact that Ernest is also a man's name.

It almost sounds like a joke now, but I was in dead earnest.
* grab                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 17:49]

When you grab something, you clutch at it. When a party-goer breaks
open a piñata, the other guests usually grab wildly at the candy that
cascades out of it.

You can grab for the string of a balloon as it floats away, or grab
your friend in a hug. Another way to grab is to make an impression:
"When I hear a marching band, it grabs my attention." A "grab bag" is
a random mixture of things, or a bag of goodies you can reach into and
grab from. If something's "up for grabs." it's available: "This last
piece of pie is up for grabs!"

I knew that my chances were next to nil, but once the idea grabbed
hold of me, I couldn’t shake free of it.


* nuttier                                                              :Hand:

[2020-09-01 Tue 17:50]

If you're spineless, you're weak or cowardly — or both. It would be
spineless to watch a bully pick on someone much smaller and not try to
intervene.

You can certainly use this adjective to literally mean "lacking a
spine," and you might if you're talking about invertebrates like the
spineless forest lizard or the Garo spineless eel. It's more common to
call people spineless as a derogatory way of commenting on their
weakness. A spineless superhero is too scared to confront the bad
guys, and a spineless politician avoids conversation with critical
constituents.

To be versed in something is to know it well and have experience with
it. If you’re well versed in Middle English literature, you know that
Chaucer wrote The Canterbury Tales in 1475. Go you.

Versed comes from the Latin word versari which means basically “to
busy oneself, to be engaged.” If you’re versed (sounds like “verst”)
in a subject, you’ve busied yourself with it and now you know it well.
A history professor is versed in history. Someone with a massive comic
book collection is probably versed in superheroes. Sometimes people
say a person is well versed instead of versed, but either way, that
person knows what they’re talking about.

When you're bragging, you're boasting. If you can't stop talking about
your fancy new shoes, that's bragging.

Ever notice how some people are full of themselves and constantly
telling you about the great things they've done? Those folks like to
brag. Bragging is a verbal kind of showing off. We all do it
sometimes, and it's almost always annoying when other people do it. A
specific boast can be called a brag. Athletes often brag before big
games. But only the winners can brag after, because they backed up
their words.

The design was nothing to brag about, but since I had no experience or
talent as a designer, that was to be expected.

To cram is to crowd or stuff people or things into a limited amount of
space. You might be tempted to cram your mouth full of your mom's
chocolate chip cookies, especially if they just came out of the oven
and are still warm and gooey.

You can cram yourself with food, or cram your books onto a shelf
that's not quite big enough to hold them. A writer might cram one book
with dozens of characters, or you could cram homemade pancakes with
blueberries. Another way to cram is to study for a test all in one
session: "I haven't studied at all yet — I'll have to stay up tonight
and cram." The Old English root, crammian, means "stuff something into
something else."

I was striving for a clear, serviceable presentation, something that
could be read at a glance and not confuse anyone, and given that so
much information had to be crammed onto every card, I think I
accomplished at least that.

If your brother is obsessive about doing the laundry, then you might
dub him the "Scion of the Spin Cycle" or the "Dean of Detergent,"
meaning you’ve given him a funny nickname that’s inspired by his
personal quirks.

The verb dub traces back to the French word adober, meaning “equip
with armor,” and originally referred to making someone a knight. Dub
still carries that meaning, although now it's more likely to describe
the giving out of titles of a different kind. Use this word when you
give someone a playful nickname or an unofficial title based on some
notable characteristic the person has, like dubbing your sister the
"Queen of Shoes."

* fair                                                                 :Hand:

When used as a noun, fair refers to a traveling show with games,
rides, and farmers showing off their prized pigs, similar to a
carnival. As an adjective, it gets a bit trickier.

The adjective fair, has several different meanings. If someone says,
"That's not fair!” they mean whatever happened wasn't just or done in
an unbiased way. If you have fair skin, you have a pale complexion. If
the weather is fair, it's a gorgeous day out. If the rides at the fair
were fair, then they were just so-so. And watch out if the umpire
shouts "fair ball!" during the baseball game — that means it was hit
within the foul lines.

I was still working on the cards at that point, but he encouraged me
to get the game in order as quickly as I could and take it to the New
York Toy Fair, which was just five or six weeks down the road.


* briefcase                                                            :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:01]


I was carrying a briefcase, but the only thing inside it was the game,
which was stowed inside a cigar box.


* stow                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:01]

When you stow something, you store it or pack it away neatly. If you
move into a tiny college dorm room, you might have to stow your shoes
under the bed.

On an airplane, you are only allowed to bring small suitcases that you
can stow in the overhead bins or under the seat in front of you. In an
adventure novel, pirates might stow their treasure in a seaside cave.
In Old English, stow was a noun, meaning "a place or spot."

I was carrying a briefcase, but the only thing inside it was the game,
which was stowed inside a cigar box.
* swarming                                                             :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:02]

A swarm is a good word for a large group of bees going on the attack —
not good news. Like bees, any group of people or animals can be
considered a swarm if they act together and quickly — even fiercely.

On a hot day, when an ice-cream truck shows up, it's usually greeted
by a swarm of hot, hungry kids. People at a concert can be a swarm —
and people in the swarm can be hurt, because there's lots of pushing
and shoving. When tickets for a popular movie go on sale, a swarm of
people will swarm the theater. As you can see, swarm works as either a
noun or verb, and people could teach bees a thing or two about
swarming.

Even at that early hour, the place was swarming with people.
* toot                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:03]

Toot is both the act of blowing on a horn and the sound that comes out
when you do. The word is fun to say, a favorite of children pretending
to be cars. It suggests a kind of merry, or at least chipper,
sensibility.

Speaking of merriment, toot can also refer to a night of drinking and
carousing. Light, fun drinking: think 1920s flappers dancing in
fountains, not hardcore alcoholics with bottles in paper bags. It's
the car behind you letting you know the light has changed or the
cheerful sound of a tugboat asking larger ships to make way. Even
"tooting your own horn" is just not that serious — it's a lighthearted
spin on the otherwise obnoxious act of bragging.

Every kiddie amusement and gadget ever dreamed of was packed into that
hall, and there wasn’t one of them that didn’t whistle or clang or
toot or beep or roar.
* din                                                                  :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:04]

Walk into the average school cafeteria at lunchtime, and you'll get a
good sense of what a din is — loud, confused, continuous, generally
unpleasant, and often potentially headache-inducing noise.

Who knew noise pollution was a problem in ancient times? Humans have
been experiencing loud, sustained, annoying sounds for centuries,
judging by the etymology of the word din. It traces its roots back to
Old English dyne or dynn, which had the same meaning as din does
today, only with a different pronunciation. Before that, it popped up
in Old Norse as dynr and meant to "come rumbling down" — fitting, from
the language that gave us Thor, the God of Thunder.

As I made my way through the din, it occurred to me that the briefcase
under my arm was the only silent object in the building.
* contempt                                                             :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:06]

Reserve the noun contempt for an extreme lack of respect: a food snob
has nothing but contempt for mass-produced burgers and fries at a
fast-food joint.

Contempt has nothing to do with the verb condemn, despite the
similarity in sound and meaning; it is from Latin temnere "to
despise," and if you despise someone, you have contempt for them. It's
a harsh term and should be used with care; it's stronger than either
disdain or scorn. It suggests you find someone or something utterly
worthless. That food snob might say the words "Big Mac" or "Whopper"
with a voice dripping in contempt.

Contempt flickered in his eyes.
* flicker                                                              :Hand:
[2020-09-01 Tue 18:06]

To flicker is to flash on and off at random. If your computer screen
is flickering right now, you are probably having trouble reading this.

Something that is flickering is flashing on and off in an
unpredictable way. A fluorescent light may flicker for a while before
it stops working. A flicker is also a quick flash or burst of light,
like a glint or a spark. Similarly, flicker can refer to a sudden and
short-lived feeling. A child opening a present might have a flicker of
excitement before realizing that the box contains only tube socks and
underwear.

Contempt flickered in his eyes.


* turd                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:14]


It was as if I had just handed him a dog turd and asked him to smell
it.


* consolation                                                          :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:18]

Consolation is something that makes someone feel better after they're
disappointed or sad.

This is a word for things that try to console someone. A consolation
prize isn't as good as first prize, but it's better than nothing. A
hug is little consolation when you've had your heart broken. You give
someone consolation when try to cheer them up. Consolation can be the
act of making someone feel better, like trying to make them laugh, but
it can also be something that makes someone happy, like a plate of
warm cookies.

After the sadistic treatment I’d been given that morning, I found some
consolation in that.
* booth                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:20]

A booth is a temporary table, tent, or area that you set up in order
to sell something. You might have a cupcake booth at a school craft
fair, for example.

You might stop at an information booth in a tourist town, or or shop
for records at a music booth in your local flea market. You can use
the noun booth for any small, impermanent stall, kiosk, or stand.
Another kind of booth is the cozy, private seating area at a
restaurant that often has high walls and benches around a table. Booth
has an Old Norse origin, the word buth, which is rooted in búa, or
"dwell."

They weren’t doing much at that hour, just sitting around their little
booth and chewing the fat, and when I told them about my game, they
seemed more than happy to have a look at it.
* rigged                                                               :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:20]

When something is rigged, it's fully equipped and ready to go. You'll
usually find this adjective describing a sailboat or ship with masts
and sails.

A fully rigged boat has all the necessary ropes, sails, and masts that
it needs to travel on the water. While this nautical adjective is
narrowly focused on sailing vessels, you can also use rigged to mean
"fraudulent" or "tampered with." If a politician talks about a rigged
election, he is not-so-subtly accusing his opponent of conspiring to
illegally manipulate the outcome of a vote. This meaning comes from a
now-obsolete meaning of rig, "a trick."

If I had rigged the cards, the results of the game I played with them
could not have been more exciting, more true to life.
* nip                                                                  :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:21]

A nip is a tiny bite, a cold feeling, or a strong taste on your
tongue. It’s also a verb for pinching or biting something, but not
always in a bad way.

Being nipped now and then isn’t a big deal. If a puppy nips your
finger, no worries. The cold morning nip when you get out of bed is
uncomfortable, but put on socks and you’re fine. Nipping can be a good
thing sometimes, like in the phrase “nip it in the bud,” which means
stopping a poor behavior or activity when it first starts. A nip can
also mean a small sip of something, like hot chocolate — which is a
good idea if you’re feeling a nip of a cold draft.

It was nip and tuck the whole way, tension riding on every pitch, and
after eight and a half innings of threats, rallies, and two-out
strikeouts with the bases loaded, the score stood at two to one.
* tuck                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:21]

To tuck is to fold, gather, or insert, like the way you tuck your
sheets under your mattress when you make the bed in the morning or the
way you tuck your lucky stuffed unicorn into your backpack on the day
of a big test.

You can tuck your shirt into your waistband, and tuck your jeans into
your cowboy boots. You can also tuck a child into bed or tuck your
book under your arm to carry it. The verb tuck can also be used
informally to mean "eat with gusto," like when you tuck into a giant
bowl of spaghetti.

It was nip and tuck the whole way, tension riding on every pitch, and
after eight and a half innings of threats, rallies, and two-out
strikeouts with the bases loaded, the score stood at two to one.
* astonishment                                                         :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:24]

Astonishment is what you feel when you're extremely surprised. If a
cat stood up and recited the Preamble to the Constitution, you’d stare
in astonishment.

Astonishment is the feeling of being blown away and shocked by
something. It’s the noun form of astonish, which is a verb meaning,
basically “to have your mind blown.” A professional magician aims to
create astonishment. A basketball player who hits every three-point
shot might make fans feel astonishment. Many people feel astonishment
when looking at something like the Grand Canyon. This is a strong word
that shouldn't refer to minor surprises. True astonishment is rare.

Then, to everyone’s astonishment, with the count at two balls and two
strikes, the next batter hit a home run to win the game.


* undisguisable                                                        :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:24]


It was a classic baseball thriller, and when the man from Joliet
turned over that final card, his face lit up with an expression of
pure, undisguisable joy.


* mull                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:25]

The verb mull means to think deeply about something, the way you might
mull over your choice of what college to attend.

When you mull something over, you ponder or seriously consider it. You
could mull over what aid organization to donate money to following a
natural disaster, or mull over what to study in college. People are
most likely to mull over important decisions, but you can use the word
mull, almost always with over, any time you're giving serious
consideration to something. A completely different meaning of mull is
"to heat, sweeten, and spice," as when you make mulled cider.

They wanted to think about it, they said, to mull it over for a while
before giving me an answer.
* dismal                                                               :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:26]

Dismal is a dreary, depressing sort of bad. "With the cold rain and
their team behind by six field goals, the mood in the stands was so
dismal even the cheerleaders had lost their 'Rah.'"

Dismal comes from the Latin dies mali which means "bad days." There is
a hopelessness implied in the word. If you fell on the way to school
and cut your knee, it would be bad, but not dismal. If you fell into a
giant mud puddle and had to wear dirty, crusty clothes until you got
home, it might make the school day seem pretty dismal.

After all the dismal, demoralizing events of that day, there was
suddenly cause for hope, and I walked out of the Toy Fair thinking
that I might actually get somewhere with my crazy scheme.
* dawn                                                                 :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:27]

The noun dawn refers to the first light of day, or the first time
period, like the dawn of a new era, which occurs when a new president
takes office.

Not just the beginning of a day, the noun dawn can refer to any
beginning, like the dawn of the Internet era. As a verb, dawn can mean
"become light" or "become clear," like when it dawns on you that you
left an important paper at home today. In that case, you can suddenly
see what you did wrong, like at the dawn of a new day, when it is no
longer dark and you can see, literally.

Weeks passed, and as I struggled to concentrate on the other work I
had to do, it gradually dawned on me that I was in for a
disappointment.
* brevity                                                              :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:28]

The noun brevity means shortness or conciseness. If you give a report
on agriculture in the northern hemisphere in 3 minutes, you have done
it with incredible brevity.

Brevity comes from brevis, which means "brief" in Latin. You can use
brevity for things that are literally short, like the brevity of an
elevator meeting, or the quality of fleetingness, like the brevity of
youth. Brevity is also a style of speaking or writing with economy.
"Brevity is the soul of wit," remarks Polonius in Shakespeare's
"Hamlet," suggesting that witty people know how to make a point
without unnecessary words.

What surprised me was its brevity, its utter lack of personal warmth.
* dunce                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:29]

A dunce is a dummy — someone who isn't smart. You might be tempted to
call your little brother a dunce when he walks out the door with his
shoes on the wrong feet.

It's not nice to call someone a dunce, though you might call yourself
one when you study the wrong chapter before a big history test or get
pulled over for yet another speeding ticket. The word dunce comes from
a thirteenth century Scottish philosopher, John Duns Scotus, whose
resistance to new ideas and mystical beliefs inspired opponents to
equate his followers, the "Duns disciples," to "dullards." Later, some
teachers made children wear pointed paper "dunce caps" when they
misbehaved.

It was an embarrassing document, a letter written by dunces, and once
my hurt began to wear off a little, I felt ashamed of myself for
having misjudged them so thoroughly.
* bound                                                                :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:30]

To bound is to jump or hop — usually as you run. Bound can also mean
to go or to plan to go, especially to a certain destination, as in
being bound for New York or homeward-bound.

Superman can "leap tall buildings in a single bound," but the word
bound is usually about boundaries. When you're playing soccer or
football, the ball goes "out of bounds." Someone can also be bound
with rope — tied up. Commitments are another kind of tie. When you get
married, you're bound to your partner. If you make a promise, you're
bound to your word. On a less pleasant note, if you're constipated,
you're bound up.

Until I had exhausted all the possibilities, I felt duty bound to
continue, to see the whole misbegotten business through to the end.
* misbegotten                                                          :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:31]

Someone who's misbegotten is born to two parents who aren't legally
married. In the past, being misbegotten was quite embarrassing.

The adjective misbegotten, which commonly means "badly planned," used
to have another use: a derogatory way to describe someone born "out of
wedlock," or to unmarried parents. It's an extremely old fashioned way
to use the word, coined in the 1500s, but you may come across it in a
book, describing a pitiful, misbegotten heroine for example. It comes
from the equally obsolete misbeget, from the literary definition of
beget, "give birth," or "parent."

Until I had exhausted all the possibilities, I felt duty bound to
continue, to see the whole misbegotten business through to the end.
* umpteen                                                              :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:34]

Use this informal word when you want to emphasize a large but vague
quantity. If you get umpteen text messages from your friend reminding
you to return the sweatshirt you borrowed, you know she really wants
it back.

Use umpteen when you have so many of something that it's not even
worth counting them. It's kind of like saying "a zillion." If the
smell of your dirty gym clothes is wafting into the hallway, your
parents might complain, "We have told you umpteen times to clean up
your room!" Umpteen started as World War I Army slang, from umpty
which means either "of an indefinite number" or "dash" in Morse code.

They went with the Olympic decathlon champion instead, and for the
next umpteen years, every box of Wheaties was adorned with a picture
of Bruce Jenner’s smiling face.
* twinge                                                               :Hand:
[2020-09-02 Wed 17:34]

A twinge is a sting or pang of pain that happens suddenly. Are you
recovering from a basketball injury? You may still feel a twinge of
discomfort in your knee when you do a layup.

You can experience a physically painful twinge, but there are also
twinges that are more emotional, like the twinge of sadness you feel
when you look at photos of your old house. Use this word as a verb,
too, if you like: "Did your shoulders twinge when you gave your little
brother a piggyback ride?" Long ago, to twinge meant to pinch, and the
word's origin traces back to the Old English twengan, "to pinch."

I never found out how close George came to getting his idea through,
but I must confess (somewhat reluctantly) that I still find it hard to
look at a box of Wheaties without feeling a little twinge.

* streamlined                                                       :Vanessa:

Something that works better because it's been made more efficient or
modern is streamlined. Your streamlined system for printing flyers
advertising your yard sale means you can print them much faster than
before.

There are two ways to use the adjective streamlined. First, there's
the simplified system, like a streamlined health care system or a
streamlined driver's license process. The second meaning is "sleek" or
"aerodynamic." The streamlined shape of a bullet train means it can
travel much faster than older, rectangular train cars. The original
meaning of streamline, from the 1850's, was "line drawn from point to
point, so that its direction is everywhere that of the motion of the
fluid."

We have streamlined all of our best findings into a universal
framework that makes up this book.
* tick                                                                :Green:
[2020-09-07 Mon 18:05]

To tick is to make a steady tapping sound. When something ticks — be
it a clock, a watch, an oven timer, or a metronome — it’s usually a
reminder that time is passing.

The verb tick originally meant "to touch or pat." The current meaning
may be related to the sound of a hand patting or tapping a surface.
Another kind of tick is a small blood-sucking parasite. This nastier
tick has a different root, the Old English ticia.

If you know exactly what makes people tick, you can optimize your
behavior, interactions, and relationships.

[2020-09-08 Tue 13:29]

Use debacle to refer to a fiasco, disaster, or great failure. If
several dogs run onto the field during the big baseball game, tripping
players and chewing up the bases, you can call the whole event a
debacle.

Debacle is sometimes used to describe a military defeat. If your army
retreats, that's one thing. If your army is outmaneuvered and ends up
huddled in a valley, surrounded on all sides by the enemy, forced to
sing 70s sitcom theme songs by their savage captors––that's a debacle.
Debacle comes from French débâcler "to clear," from Middle French
desbacler, from the prefix des- "completely, utterly" plus bacler "to
block."

"the economic debacle that became known as the Great Depression"
* startling                                                           :Green:
[2020-09-08 Tue 13:40]

Something that's startling is so unexpected that it shocks or
surprises you. It would be startling to open your front door and see a
clown standing there.

Startling events or circumstances aren't necessarily frightening,
though they can be. A surprise party, if it's planned right, is
startling, and it can be startling the first time you meet your best
friend's identical twin sister. Alarm clocks, smoke alarms, and
barking dogs can all be equally startling. They startle you — and
startle comes from start, with its Old English root styrtan, "to leap
up."

Debacle, I thought it is rather startling.
* flair                                                               :Green:
[2020-09-09 Wed 09:11]

Use the word flair to refer to someone’s knack or natural talent for
something. Someone might have a flair for throwing fantastic parties,
or a flair for solving complex math problems.

Something or someone with flair is flashy, catchy and full of energy.
But oddly enough, flair meant "odor" when it originated in the mid
14th century. It wasn’t until 1925 that the word came to mean a
distinctive talent, elegant style or dashing ability. So maybe think
of someone absolutely reeking of style and panache — but in a good
way.

And such people, such deep narcissists, can actually go pretty far in
life, because as children they developed of lot of flair and charisma.
* tacit                                                             :Vanessa:
[2020-09-09 Wed 09:49]

Something tacit is implied or understood without question. Holding
hands might be a tacit acknowledgment that a boy and girl are dating.

The adjective tacit refers to information that is understood without
needing to acknowledge it. For example, since we know that the sky is
blue, that kind of assumption is tacit. Lawyers talk about "tacit
agreements," where parties give their silent consent and raise no

An ice floe is a large, free-floating, flat chunk of ice floating in
the ocean. Beware: if you're at the North Pole, you could get stranded
on an ice floe along with polar bears and other arctic creatures.

A floe can vary in size from small to giant, but they differ from
icebergs in their relative lack of depth. When you spot an iceberg,
it’s often just the tip of what’s there, but with a floe, what you see
is what you get. The floe edge is where the ice that is still attached
to the land, having frozen over the winter months, meets the sea. When
the floe edge fractures, the ice floe floats out to sea.

So he had to order all of his men off the ship and onto this ice floe.

[2020-09-09 Wed 10:50]

When you experience discontent, you're not happy. You've been let down
— either by others or by yourself.

The word discontent is made up of dis, meaning "not," and content, "a
state of peaceful happiness." So as an adjective, discontent means
"not happy or peaceful," like the discontent Egyptian citizens who
expressed their dissatisfaction with their country's leader by
protesting and demanding he give up power. As a verb, discontent means
"to make unhappy," like bad news that discontents you.

I would slowly direct their attention away from the boss and the job,
and instead get them to search inside themselves and try to find the
emotional root of their discontent.
* rapport                                                           :Vanessa:
[2020-09-11 Fri 06:49]

Rapport is a good sense of understanding and trust. If you have good
rapport with your neighbors, they won't mind if you kick your ball
onto their property every now and then.

If you have rapport with someone, you two communicate with trust and
sympathy. The word is often used to mean good interaction between
people in different positions or roles such as parent and teacher,
teacher and student, doctor and patient, supervisor and worker, or
speaker and audience. It is always important to establish rapport with
people you come into contact with regularly. Pronounce this borrowed
word from the French ra-POOR.

His team had to draw the battle off the main stage to make the

At the cartooning contest, you could draw out your pen and draw a
narwhal, and the competition could still end in a draw. The meanings
of draw include "to pull gently" and "to sketch" and "an even score".

The original meaning of draw comes from the Old English dragan,
"drag." This meaning is still common today, like when you draw the
curtains shut or when a horse draws a carriage through Central Park.
The most common way to use the verb draw is to mean "produce an image
using lines," which came from the idea of drawing a pen or pencil
across paper. Occasionally, draw gets confused with drawer, a noun
meaning "a compartment that slides out."

His team had to draw the battle off the main stage to make the
convention work to Truman’s strength: one-on-one rapport building.

* dread                                                             :Vanessa:
[2020-09-11 Fri 07:02]

The noun dread describes the fear of something bad happening, like the
dread you feel when walking alone on a deserted street in the dark.

Dread is a feeling of fear, but it can also be the desire to avoid
something. For example, many people feel dread at the very thought of
speaking in front of an audience. As a verb, dread means "to fear or
not want something to happen," like students who did not study and as
a result, dread getting their graded tests back. As an adjective,
dread means "frightening or terrifying," like a dread monster.

We are happier around happy individuals, and we thrive with thriving
people. When you force yourself to go to events you are dreading, you
are not only miserable, but your misery is contagious.
* baloney                                                           :Vanessa:
[2020-09-11 Fri 07:07]

Baloney is nonsense. When someone says something completely
ridiculous, call it a bunch of baloney. If your friend tells you a
unicorn on roller skates ate the last cookie, tell her she’s full of
baloney!

The word baloney comes from the sandwich meat called bologna, which is
typically made of leftover scraps of meat. Around 1920, baloney came
to mean "nonsense," and it was also used to describe an unskilled
boxer. Use it to describe utter nonsense, not necessarily evil lies,
but just words that mean nothing. A politician who spouts clichés but
really says nothing is full of baloney, and so is a pretentious artist
or a pompous showoff.

As the science shows, this is a big smelly sack of baloney.
* trudge                                                            :Vanessa:
[2020-09-11 Fri 07:08]

To trudge is to walk in a heavy, exhausted way. Your grandpa probably
tells you about how he used to trudge six miles uphill through a foot
of snow in the brutal cold every morning just to get to school.

Trudge is also a noun that means a difficult, labored walk. If you
take a mile-long trudge through heavy snow or mud, your steps will be
slower and it will require more effort to put one foot in front of the
other. Need help remembering what trudge means? Say it out loud.
Trudge rhymes with sludge — and walking through sludge, or thick muck,
would cause you to trudge.

So almost every weeknight, I trudged out to the professional circuit.


* platter                                                           :Vanessa:

* get along                                                         :Vanessa:
[2020-09-11 Fri 07:13]

Along means "moving constantly in line with." When you walk along the
road, you're going forward, keeping the road at your side.

You can move along a path or drive along a highway, and you can also
figuratively move along: "I learned a lot along the way." Something
that extends in a nearly horizontal line can also be described as
along, like the seaweed that stretches along the high-tide line on the
beach. In Old English, it was andlang, "entire, continuous," "all day
long," or "alongside of."

You can get along with anyone, but you don’t have to get along with
everyone.

[2020-09-11 Fri 10:00]

If you discover late Sunday night that the dog really did eat your
homework, you might cry out in dismay. Dismay describes an emotional
state of alarm, fear, or serious disappointment.

The first part of dismay comes from the Latin prefix dis-, which comes
in handy when you want to put a negative spin on words (dishonest,
discount, disenchant, etc.). The last bit of dismay most likely comes
from the Germanic word magan, meaning "to be able to." You can employ
the word dismay to describe how you feel in a variety of negative
situations that you doubt you are able to handle.

Or they could be colleagues or hires who reveal, to our dismay, that
they are completely out for themselves, using us as stepping-stones.
* harbor                                                             :Greene:
[2020-09-11 Fri 10:02]

A harbor is a safe place providing refuge and comfort. If you're
traveling, the harbor provided by a warm hotel is welcome. For ships,
a harbor is a sheltered port area shielded from waves, where it's safe
to dock.

Harbor can also be used as a verb, which describes maintaining a
belief or a feeling. If you harbor ill-will toward your neighbor John,
you don't like him much. Harbor can also mean you hold back your ideas
and don't express them openly. John may have no idea you hate him if
you harbor your true feelings deep inside, but pretend you like him to
his face.

It is as if we harbor a stranger within us, a little demon who
operates independently of our willpower and pushes us into doing the
wrong things.
* latch                                                              :Greene:
[2020-09-11 Fri 10:04]

When you unlock your front door, you open the latch. A latch is a
fastener or lock that you open with a key.

A latch can usually be opened with a key or by turning a knob or
lifting a hook or bar. You can also use the word latch as a verb, like
when your mom reminds you to latch the front and back doors before you
leave for school in the morning. In some places, the word "latch-key"
is used to mean "key." The root of latch is the Germanic word læccan,
"to grasp or seize."

We might latch onto some simple explanations: “That person is evil, a
sociopath” or “Something came over me; I wasn’t myself.”
* pat                                                                :Greene:
[2020-09-11 Fri 10:04]

When you pat, you tap lightly with your hand. A sad friend might be
comforted by a kind pat on the shoulder. But that sad friend would not
be comforted by a pat, insincere, comment.

Your grandfather might pat you on the head just like when you were
little, even though you're taller than he is now. Dogs like getting a
pat on the head, or maybe a pat of butter from the dinner table. When
it's an adjective, pat means "way too simple" or "glib," as in "I
asked a serious question — please don't give me a pat answer." To
"have something down pat" is to know it by heart.

But such pat descriptions do not lead to any understanding or prevent
the same patterns from recurring.
* fathom                                                             :Greene:
[2020-09-11 Fri 10:06]

To fathom something is to understand it thoroughly, and is usually
used in the negative, as in "I can't fathom why he doesn't want to go
along with us."

Fathom is from Middle English fadme, from Old English fæthm
"outstretched arms." The Old English and modern English noun also
refers to a unit of length used to measure the depth of water. To
understand something thoroughly is "to get to the bottom of it."

What if we could truly fathom why people suddenly behave irrationally
and reveal a much darker side to their character, or why they are
always ready to provide a rationalization for their behavior, or why
we continually turn to leaders who appeal to the worst in us?
* gain                                                               :Greene:
[2020-09-11 Fri 10:09]

A gain is an increase in something, especially something good. You
gain knowledge by attending philosophy lectures and reading books.

When you gain something, you acquire it or add to what you already
have. You can gain friends by joining clubs, and you can gain weight
by eating ice cream every day. Gain is also a noun, which you can use
to talk about what you've gained, like the health gain you get from
cutting back on that ice cream. The root of gain is the Old French
gaaignier, "to earn, trade, or capture."

And with that awareness we would be able to break the negative
patterns in our lives, stop making excuses for ourselves, and gain
better control of what we do and what happens to us.
* compel                                                             :Greene:
[2020-09-11 Fri 10:10]

Compel means to force or drive someone to do something. Even if you
don't like toast, when you visit the toast-eating natives of
Shrintakook Island, you'll be compelled to eat it, or they will not
trust you.

You don't want to be compelled to go to a classical music concert if
you'd rather listen to rap. School officials might be upset if a
winter storm compels them to cancel classes, but you'd be okay with
that. A compelling mystery forces you to pay attention because you
want to find out "whodunit."

We see the results—our thoughts, moods, and actions—but have little
conscious access to what actually moves our emotions and compels us to
behave in certain ways.
* venue                                                              :Greene:

A venue is the place where an event or meeting is happening. If you're
going to see the best band ever, you should get to the venue early to
get a good seat.

Venue is derived from the Latin for "come" (venire), and it's a place
people come to. Another meaning of venue is specific to the law as the
place where a trial will be held, and the area from which the jury
will be selected. If you're on trial for stealing, and you're known
around town as "Sticky Fingers Magoo," your lawyer would wisely
request a change of venue to give you a better shot at a fair trial.

At the Science of People, we partner with event organizers who let us

[2020-09-11 Fri 11:20]

To defend a belief or keep affirming that it's true is to contend.
People used to contend that the earth was flat, but eventually, when
no one dropped off the edge no matter how far they traveled, the
"round" theory won.

One of the meanings of contend is from the French "to strive with,"
and it is a literal fighting, as in "to contend with fists." Most
contemporary uses of the verb contend illustrate competitions of proof
or defense, where a person will contend that something is true, or
better, or wrong. It is still a striving but more of a verbal kind,
where what you contend is what you hope to convince others is correct.

Not only will you eat too much and contend with a food baby all night,
but you will also make it hard for other people to get their food and
eat.

[2020-09-11 Fri 11:28]

Advice is a suggestion about what to do. If you just can't decide
between the pecan pie and the chocolate torte, ask the waiter for his
advice.

Advice comes from old French words for seeing, or view. It first meant
opinion, but came to mean an opinion about what to do. If you become
President, you'll gather a cabinet to give you their advice. If your
doctor tells you to eat better, exercise more, and take up swimming,
that's her medical advice. Someone gives you their advice, never "an
advice." You can, however, ask for a "piece of advice."

About two weeks after an online body language course I taught went

unsolicited advice.

Inadvertently is an adverb that means "without knowledge or intent,"
like when you inadvertently take someone else's coat from the coatroom
because it looks just like yours.

When you do something inadvertently, you don't mean to do it — you
might inadvertently step in a puddle, leave something important at
home, or hurt your friend's feelings. Some things that happen
inadvertently aren't mistakes, though: They happen by chance. For
example, if you just happen to park your car at the exact place that
blocks a bus from hitting a pedestrian, you've inadvertently saved a
life.

What if we could find out what causes us to lie about who we are, or
to inadvertently push people away?

[2020-09-14 Mon 13:07]

Of all the many nouns referring to a large group of things, one of the
most fun is slew, as in "I saw a whole slew of birds in the tree by
the river."

American English is constantly evolving, its richness coming from the
many languages feeding into it. The noun slew, for instance, is from
the Irish Gaelic sluagh, meaning "multitude." As an unrelated verb,
it's the past tense of slay.

We could say something similar about a whole slew of emotions that we
feel—specific types of events trigger sudden confidence, or
insecurity, or anxiety, or attraction to a particular person, or
hunger for attention.
* ascribe :Greene:
[2020-09-14 Mon 13:08]

Ascribe means to give credit to, like if you ascribe the A you got on
your group project to the hard work of your partners!

Ascribe's Latin root is ascribere, meaning basically "to write in.''
Makes sense, because ascribe is often used to link writers to their
words. Many a quirky quote, like "Age is an issue of mind over matter.
If you don't mind, it doesn't matter," is ascribed to that famous
scribe Mark Twain. It can also be a way of blaming something — you
might ascribe your bad attitude to your mom because she won't let you
have cupcakes for dinner.

We can ascribe many of the details of our nature to the distinct way
we evolved as a social animal to ensure our survival—learning to
cooperate with others, coordinating our actions with the group on a
high level, creating novel forms of communication and ways of
maintaining group discipline.
* permeable :Greene:

Something that is permeable can be passed through, especially by
liquids or gases. "I wish I hadn't worn my permeable sweater to the
picnic when the weatherman called for thunderstorms. The rain seeped
right through the fabric, soaking me to the skin."

A permeable surface allows materials like liquids to pass through —
either in or out. Inside the body, the walls of cells are permeable
membranes that allow fluids and nutrients to get in and nourish the
cells. A permeable shirt is good to wear in the summer, because it
helps release the sweat sticking to the skin.

They became extremely permeable to the emotions of others as a way to
bind the group more tightly together—to feel joy or grief as one—or to
remain united in the face of danger.

[2020-09-14 Mon 13:12]

If you frown at someone, you look at them with disapproval, and if you
frown on something they do, you don't approve of that either. Because
you frown on smoking, you probably frown at smokers too!

The distant ancestors of frown, the ones that came long before Old
French, meant "nose." Think about the expression, to look down one's
nose at someone or something, which means "to disapprove of." If you
have a frown on your face, you definitely don't like what you see!
Sometimes when you're thinking hard about something, you might frown,
but that is probably more of an expression of concentration than
disapproval.

We can add to these primitive qualities our need to wear masks to
disguise any behavior that is frowned upon by the tribe, leading to
the formation of a shadow personality from all the dark desires we
have repressed.
* exploit :Greene:
[2020-09-14 Mon 13:15]

An exploit is a heroic act or notable deed. The King Arthur legends
are full of stories of the exploits of the Knights of the Round Table,
including Sir Lancelot and King Arthur himself.

This noun is from Middle English expleit, "outcome," from Latin
explicitus, "unfolded, set forth." The verb exploit means to use
someone or something, usually selfishly or for profit. Workers who are
tired of being exploited by factory owners form unions that allow them
to stand together as a powerful force.

We can exploit the vast literature in psychology amassed over the last
one hundred years, including detailed studies of childhood and the
impact of our early development (Melanie Klein, John Bowlby, Donald
Winnicott), as well as works on the roots of narcissism (Heinz Kohut),
the shadow sides of our personality (Carl Jung), the roots of our
empathy (Simon Baron-Cohen), and the configuration of our emotions
(Paul Ekman).
* cull :Greene:
[2020-09-14 Mon 13:16]

To cull means to select or gather. If you decide to make a literary
anthology, you must cull the best possible stories and then arrange
them in a pleasing manner.

When you use cull as a verb, the things you gather can be the good or
bad ones from a group. In your garden, you can cull the good
vegetables for dinner, or the rotten ones for the compost pile. In
fact, often no judgment of quality is made, as when you cull
information from the Internet for your next research project. The
sorting through will come later. However, if you use the word as a
noun, a cull is a selection of things you intend to reject, often in
reference to a group of animals. An outbreak of a disease such as
foot-and-mouth disease can cause authorities to order a cull of farm
pigs.

We can now cull the many advances in the sciences that can aid us in
our self-understanding—studies of the brain (Antonio Damasio, Joseph
E.
* appraisal :Greene:
[2020-09-14 Mon 13:18]

An appraisal is a judgment of something, especially an estimate of how
much it's worth. Usually you need an expert to give an official
appraisal.

If you were selling a house, you'd need an expert in real estate to
give an appraisal of how much it's worth — that's an official estimate
of how much you could sell it for. But this word can also be used in
other less formal situations that call for a judgment or opinion of
some sort. If you painted a picture, you could ask, "What's your
appraisal of my work?" Hopefully the answer is "beautiful!"

It is a brutally realistic appraisal of our species, dissecting who we
are so we can operate with more awareness.
* gamut :Greene:
[2020-09-14 Mon 13:18]

A visit with a long-lost cousin might arouse emotions that run the
gamut of from joy to nostalgia to sorrow. A gamut is a full or
complete range.

In the 16th century, the gamut was the lowest note on the musical
scale. In music as well as life, the word has expanded to mean from
high to low, or the whole range. The word is often associated with
"run," as in "run the gamut from totally excited to so terrified
you're quaking with fear." And if you've talked about every discussion
point on your agenda, you've covered the gamut of issues that need
discussing.

Consider The Laws of Human Nature a kind of codebook for
deciphering people’s behavior—ordinary, strange,
destructive, the full gamut.
* apropos :Angela:
[2020-09-14 Mon 13:33]

Apropos means regarding or appropriate to, as in: Apropos of your
interest in fishing, your grandfather gave you his set of championship
lures, rods, reels and lucky tackle box.

Apropos is a useful word to learn. But first you have to know how to
pronounce it: AP-rə-pō. Then you can conveniently change the subject
of a conversation by using the expression "Apropos of nothing," which
is a glib way of saying, "Oh, and by the way..." If someone's remarks
are suitable and appropriate to the occasion, you can get on their
good side by saying: How apropos!

He liked to say,
apropos of nothing at all, “You know, you’re no genius!”
* handicap :Angela:
[2020-09-14 Mon 13:35]

A mental or physical disadvantage, such as blindness or a missing leg,
is a handicap: something that disables you in some way. Handicaps can
also be imposed artificially to even out the odds in sporting events.

A sporting handicap might be a faster horse carrying an extra weight,
or a better golfer having a few strokes added to her score to make
things more competitive. Sometimes fate imposes a handicap, as when
bad weather handicaps your travel plans, or a strike handicaps the
subway system. Handicap comes from the term hand in cap, an ancient
British practice in which two bettors placed their money into a hat
held by a neutral third party before a bet.

Dad worried that this intellectual
handicap would limit what we’d eventually achieve in life.
* offhand :Angela:
[2020-09-14 Mon 13:36]

The adjective offhand describes a remark or comment that is made
without previous thought or preparation. If you are at a wedding, you
may want to make a few offhand but nice remarks about the newlyweds.

As an adjective, offhand can mean careless, brusque, or inconsiderate.
You may frequently have to remind young children that offhand comments
about people's looks or intelligence can hurt their feelings. Offhand
can also be used as an adverb, meaning without thought or planning.
You may not be able to say offhand, but do you have any idea how many
people are in your class at school?

Then my thoughts turned to my dad and his offhand
diagnoses of my intellectual potential.
* propensities :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:39]

A propensity is a natural tendency to behave in a certain way. We all
have propensities — things we tend to do. Dogs have a propensity to
bark, and many people have a propensity for getting annoyed by it.

If you have a propensity for something, then it's something that comes
naturally to you or something you just do a lot. Some people have a
propensity to laugh. Other people have a propensity for making others
laugh, or for being generous, or for getting angry. It's hard to
change your propensities. Sometimes a propensity is a bad thing, as in
a criminal with a propensity for theft or murder.

Notice how our
propensities to compare ourselves with others, to feel
envy, and to seek status through attention have only
become intensified with our ability to communicate so
quickly with so many people.
* mayhem :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:39]

Mayhem is a violent and rowdy disturbance, like what you might
experience at an overcrowded rock concert or a day-after-Thanksgiving
sale.

You may encounter several types of disturbances in your life, but
mayhem is typically used for disturbances involving crowds. The word
mayhem comes to us not from Latin, as many English words do, but from
Anglo-French, a dialect of French that developed in England several
centuries ago. We’re guessing those Anglo-French speakers had a
reputation for being a pretty rowdy bunch.

The potential for mayhem stemming from the
primitive side of our nature has only increased.
* pawns :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:40]

To pawn something is to use it as collateral when you're borrowing
money. When you pawn a necklace at a pawn shop, you get cash in
exchange for it with the understanding that you can buy it back later.

The benefit when you pawn something is getting cash immediately. The
down side is that you'll have to pay more money — the amount you
borrowed, plus interest — to get your item back. If you aren't able to
do this, the pawn shop will sell it to someone else. As a noun, a pawn
is the smallest, least powerful piece in a game of chess, or a
description of a person who's being used or manipulated.

It moves us around like pawns.
* peril :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:40]

If you realize mid-climb that your rock climbing rope is frayed, you
might be in peril. The word peril means imminent danger to life and
limb.

Peril comes from the Latin peric(u)lum, meaning danger. Today it's
often used in tandem with the word mortal, which relates to death. For
example, you're in mortal peril when you're flying down a cliff-side
trail on your mountain bike and you hit loose gravel. Peril can also
describe dangers of a less physical sort, though it's less common. If
your employer sinks your 401K into what turns out to be a Ponzi
scheme, he's put your retirement in peril.

Ignore the laws at your own peril.

You will think in terms of opposites—when people overtly
display some trait, such as confidence or
hypermasculinity, they are most often concealing the
contrary reality.
* gauge :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:47]

If you ask your friend, "How do you feel, generally, about loaning
your car to people?" your intention might be to gauge his reaction
before you flat-out ask if you can borrow his car. To gauge is to
measure or test.

The verb gauge means to estimate or measure, while the noun gauge is a
tool you can use to make such a measurement. If you've ever seen
someone check the air pressure in a tire, the instrument she used was
called a tire gauge. The thickness, or diameter, of an item like wire
(or the barrel of a gun) is another meaning of gauge.

The ability to gauge people’s true worth, their degree of
loyalty and conscientiousness, is one of the most
important skills you can possess, helping you avoid the
bad hires, partnerships, and relationships that can make
your life miserable.

The ability to gauge people’s true worth, their degree of
loyalty and conscientiousness, is one of the most
important skills you can possess, helping you avoid the
bad hires, partnerships, and relationships that can make
your life miserable.
* flattery :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:49]

Flattery is excessive praise. If you're hoping to borrow your
brother's car, be careful not to overdo it when you compliment his
haircut, new shoes, and singing voice — he knows flattery when he sees
it.

As opposed to real praise, flattery is insincere and almost always has
an ulterior motive. The Old English root word of flatter is flater,
which originally meant "to stroke with the hand or caress." When you
stroke someone's ego to get what you want, you're using flattery. If
the person you are wildly complimenting tells you that flattery will
get you nowhere, you know it's time to back off.

They have learned
to appear charming in initial encounters, to use flattery
and other means of disarming us.
* bluster :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:50]

If you tell the captain of the basketball team that you're going to
beat him at a game of hoops even though you've never played, you're
speaking with a lot of bluster or false confidence and bravado.

Bluster can also mean a strong wind. On a blustery day, you'll see
trees blowing and people holding onto their hats. When someone full of
bluster is talking about how they can do something that you think they
can't, they're blowing a lot of hot air in your direction. And
coincidently, another name for that type of person is a blowhard.

You
will learn to mentally cut them down to size and focus on
the glaring weaknesses and insecurities behind all of their
bluster.
* scoff :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:51]

To laugh at someone with scorn is to scoff at them. People have
scoffed at many great inventors, saying their products would flop
because the public wouldn't be interested in things like the light
bulb, the personal computer, or the pet rock.

The verb scoff is often followed by the word at ("scoff at the idea,
scoff at the statement, scoff at the notion"). The verb can also mean
to treat with contempt or to mock. Naysayers scoff at all kinds of
theories, and grouchy old men tend to scoff for the heck of it.

You will scoff
at their cover stories and elaborate explanations for their
selfish behavior.
* cajoling :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:52]

To cajole someone is to persuade them by using insincere compliments
or promises. If you say "Please, pretty-please, I'll be your best
friend," when asking for a stick of gum, you are cajoling the gum
holder.

The origin of this word is probably a blend of two French words
meaning "to chatter like a jaybird" and "to lure into a cage." When
you cajole that guy into lending you some money, picture him as the
bird going into the cage. In fact, the word cajole may be associated
with another French word meaning "to put in jail."

Normally, when we meet resistance to our ideas or plans,
we cannot help trying to directly change people’s minds by
arguing, lecturing, or cajoling them, all of which makes
them more defensive.
* inadvertently :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:53]

Inadvertently is an adverb that means "without knowledge or intent,"
like when you inadvertently take someone else's coat from the coatroom
because it looks just like yours.

When you do something inadvertently, you don't mean to do it — you
might inadvertently step in a puddle, leave something important at
home, or hurt your friend's feelings. Some things that happen
inadvertently aren't mistakes, though: They happen by chance. For
example, if you just happen to park your car at the exact place that
blocks a bus from hitting a pedestrian, you've inadvertently saved a
life.

You will
train yourself to discern their insecurities and never
inadvertently stir them up.
* permeability :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:54]

Use the noun permeability to describe how slowly or quickly water
soaks into something, particularly soil.

You're most likely to come across the word permeability in an earth
science class. The permeability of something means basically the same
thing as how absorbent it is — for example, a gravel driveway has much
greater permeability than a heavy clay soil does. The root word is the
Latin permeabilis, "that can be passed through."

Understanding the permeability of emotions, you will learn
that the most effective means of influence is to alter your
moods and attitude.
* demeanor :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:55]

Your demeanor is defined as being either your facial appearance or
your behavior. When playing poker, don't let your demeanor give away
how good your cards are.

Demeanor in English today has evolved from Middle English and Old
French to refer to the way one manages or presents oneself, and this
definition applies to conduct as well as facial expressions. The way
you present yourself often affects how others make judgments about you
and therefore, you might want your demeanor to reflect the situation
you're in. So, if you're at a birthday party, your demeanor should be
happy and smiling!

People are responding to your energy
and demeanor even more than to your words.
* astray :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:56]

If you go astray, you lose the path. If you went to college intending
to become a doctor, but instead became interested in making violent
video games, your parents might feel you have gone astray.

A stray animal is one that has gotten loose, and the adverb astray
comes from this sense of wandering off from the proper place, even
though it's not just for animals. If you go astray, you lose the right
way, or are out of place. It can be a moral judgment: juvenile
delinquents are kids who have gone astray. But it can also refer to
small details. If you dress impeccably, you make sure that no thread
is astray.

If we go astray, it is the fault of circumstances or people
forcing us to react negatively.
* deluding :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 12:57]

To delude is to trick or fool, often in relation to yourself. If you
delude yourself into thinking your mom's chocolate cake is low in fat,
you'll be disappointed to find out it's made with two sticks of
butter!

If you delude someone into thinking something, you are making a fool
of them, or making them foolish. The word shares a root with ludicrous
which means completely ridiculous. The thing that you foolishly
believe is a delusion. Someone with delusions of grandeur has deluded
themselves into thinking they are very, very special.

The Laws will make you stop
once and for all this self-deluding process.
* intuit :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 13:00]

To intuit is to get a strong sense of something using only your
intuition. You might give up on a job interview halfway through, if
you intuit that the job wouldn't be a good fit for you.

When you have a hunch about something, you intuit. For example, a
pregnant woman might intuit that she's having twins, and a teacher
might intuit that a student is having a hard day and needs some extra
attention. The earliest meaning of intuit was "to tutor," until the
mid-19th century. The word comes from the Latin root intueri, "look
at, comprehend, or contemplate."

It is a power developed by our earliest
ancestors, in which they learned how to intuit the moods
and feelings of others by placing themselves in their
perspective.
* glean :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 13:02]

Glean means to gather bit by bit, either literally or figuratively.
You might glean leftover grain from a recently harvested field or
glean information about new vocabulary words by hearing them used in
context.

When you glean information, you sort through ideas and take what you
need. Seeing a word in context lets you glean information about how
it's used, for example. If you want to find treasures at a thrift
shop, you’ll have to glean the good stuff out of the piles of junk. To
glean a field means to walk along and see what’s left on the ground.
It takes patience to glean.

You will not
be simply intuitive, but rather you will analyze the
information you glean in this empathic fashion, gaining
insights.
* innumerable :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:34]

Something innumerable can't be counted — there are just too many, like
the stars in the sky. Innumerable things are infinite.

Things that are countless, multitudinous, myriad, numberless,
uncounted, or unnumerable are also called innumerable: you couldn't
count them if you tried. There are a lot of countries in the world,
but they aren't innumerable. On the other hand, the number of drops in
the ocean is definitely innumerable. And if you wanted to be really
nice, you'd say "Her charms are innumerable!" Even though you could
probably count all of her good qualities.

Cultivating such empathy will have innumerable benefits.
* preconceptions :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:36]

A preconception is an idea or opinion you have about something before
you really know much about it. You might have the preconception that
all New Yorkers are rude until you visit the city and start meeting
friendly people.

Imagine you give your friend an assessment of a popular TV show,
saying, "Oh, it's so boring!" despite the fact that you've never seen
it. Your negative opinion of the show is a preconception — you may be
correct about the show, but you won't know until you actually sit down
a watch a few episodes. Preconception comes from pre, "before," and
the Latin concipere, "to take in and hold."

You are
training yourself to let go of preconceptions, to be alive in
the moment, and to continually adapt your ideas about
people.
* entertaining :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:37]

Things that are entertaining are enjoyable and distracting. Going to
the circus is an entertaining way to spend an afternoon.

Activities like playing games and watching movies can be entertaining,
and you can also describe a friend who's particularly funny or fun to
be with as entertaining. The adjective comes from the related verb,
entertain, which meant "keep up, maintain, or keep someone in a
certain frame of mind" in the fifteenth century. It comes from the Old
French entretenir, "hold together."

You will find such fluidity affecting how you attack
problems in general—you will find yourself entertaining
other possibilities, taking alternative perspectives.
* recoil :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:41]

A recoil is a movement backwards, usually from some force or impact.
The recoil of a gun is a backward movement caused by momentum. Your
trip to the shooting range might make your mom recoil — from horror,
not momentum.

Recoil has both a verb and a noun form, meaning any kind of rebound or
spring backwards. It doesn’t even have to be from an actual force. You
might recoil when you see a snake, or recoil at the thought of having
to eat squid. In those cases it’s more like a cringe or a flinch from
something that’s scary, disgusting, or painful. Eating squid might in
fact be all of those things to you.

Our thoughts almost
inevitably revolve around this desire; we simply recoil from
entertaining ideas that are unpleasant or painful to us.

* soothe :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:43]

To soothe is to relieve or to bring comfort. If the pounding in your
head is driving you mad, it sounds like you might need an aspirin or
two to soothe your headache.

Soothing is meant to make you feel better, both physically and
emotionally. Spend too many hours on the beach without sunblock?
You'll need some aloe to soothe that sunburn. Had a bad breakup with a
boyfriend? Soothing that broken heart might take something stronger —
chocolates, a gabfest with good friends, and sappy movies are usually
just what the doctor ordered.

We
imagine we are looking for the truth, or being realistic,
when in fact we are holding on to ideas that bring a release
from tension and soothe our egos, make us feel superior.
* objective :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:45]

An objective is something you plan to achieve. A military objective is
the overall plan for a mission. The objective for a bake sale is to
raise money. If your objective is to learn a new word, you have
succeeded.

An objective is the point of something. If you don’t understand the
objective of a class, then you don’t know what you were supposed to
learn. The word itself is often used in business or work. Another
meaning of objective is “looking at things in a detached, impartial,
fact-based way.” If a police officer falls in love with a witness, it
might be hard for her to stay objective. The word comes from the Latin
ob "against" + jacere "to throw.”

What could be more objective or scientific?
* confirmation :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:46]

A confirmation provides proof that something is true. An example might
be when you receive confirmation that your flight will be on time, or
you find out that something you thought might have happened actually
did occur.

Confirmation is verification or final proof of something. In the
church, confirmation is a rite in which a person if awarded full
acceptance into — i.e., confirmed in — the religion, usually presented
in a ceremony attended by family and friends. You can see how that
ties in with the more general definition of substantiation of a fact
or assertion. Confirmation is an obvious derivative of the verb
confirm.

This is known as confirmation bias.
* veer :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:47]

To veer is to make a sudden turn, like when a driver veers off the
pavement or a pleasant conversation veers off in a troubling
direction.

When you make any quick change of direction you veer. You can veer
toward an attractive person at a party, leaving your friends
mid-sentence. You veer away from an oncoming truck on the highway to
avoid getting crushed. Originally, veer described a change in the
direction of the wind, but as you can see, today, anyone or anything
that changes direction veers.

Inevitably they veer
toward information that confirms the desired positive
result, the rosy scenario, without realizing it.
* supposedly :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:48]

If you hear that something is supposedly going to happen, it may or
may not occur. If a friend is supposedly having a pool party next
week, wait until you know for sure before you buy that new swimsuit.

When you add supposedly to a sentence, it means you aren't sure. If a
teacher says there is supposedly an early dismissal next week, it
means that decision isn't final yet, but it could happen. If a singer
is supposedly dating a certain actor, it isn't official — it might
just be gossip. Don't confuse supposedly with similar-sounding
supposed to be, which can imply a judgment.

We also see
this at work when people are supposedly asking for
advice.
* bane :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:48]

The noun bane refers to anything that is a cause of harm, ruin, or
death. But we often use it for things that aren't that bad, just feel
like it. You might say mosquitoes are the bane of your existence.

The source of this word is Middle and Old English bana, meaning
"destroyer, murderer." The now obsolete meaning of "deadly poison" is
seen in the names of poisonous plants such as wolfsbane and henbane.
Although "bane of my existence" is a commonly heard phrase, there's
something deliciously archaic about the word bane. It conjures up
villages preyed upon by dragons, or witches adding one bane or another
to a steaming kettle.

This is the bane of most consultants.
* trotted :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:50]

To trot is move faster than walking, but not quite at a full-out run.
You might trot down the street when you hear the ice cream truck
coming.

People can trot — as they do when they jog or do a slow run — and so
can four-legged animals, especially horses. When you see a horse trot,
you'll notice that its diagonally opposite legs move together,
touching the ground at the same time. Trot is a Middle English word
that comes from Old French, troter, "to trot or to go," which in turn
has a Germanic root related to the word tread.

Statistics and studies are trotted out to prove them; these
are not very difficult to find, once you are convinced of the
rightness of your argument.
* muster :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:51]

Originally meaning "to gather soldiers," muster has been expanded to
include gathering up just about anything — you can muster up some
dinner, some friends, or even some ketchup, pickles and mustard.

Remember that muster used to involve getting reluctant soldiers out of
bed and into the field of battle — so it involves overcoming a certain
inertia. When you muster up the courage to face something, it's clear
that this is pretty scary for you.

Instead,
examine the evidence yourself in the cold light of day, with
as much skepticism as you can muster.

* vehemence :Greene:
[2020-09-21 Mon 16:54]

Something with vehemence is forceful and energetic. If you
passionately believe that your neighbor is mistreating his dog, speak
to him with vehemence.

Vehemence is the quality of being vehement, or powerful. We often
describe passionate speeches as having vehemence. You could also
describe a violent natural event as vehement. A hurricane sweeps onto
coastal land with destructive vehemence. If your dancing style is wild
and involves throwing your limbs every which way as fast as possible,
then you dance with vehemence.

We hold on to an idea that is secretly pleasing to us, but
deep inside we might have some doubts as to its truth, and
so we go an extra mile to convince ourselves—to believe in
it with great vehemence and to loudly contradict anyone
who challenges us.
* certainty :Greene:

This
bias is revealed even more clearly in our relationship to
leaders—if they express an opinion with heated words and
gestures, colorful metaphors and entertaining anecdotes,
and a deep well of conviction, it must mean they have
examined the idea carefully to express it with such
certainty.
* overt :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 16:34]

Overt means open and done in plain sight. An overt demand for an
increase in your allowance probably won't work; instead, try praising
your parents' generosity and dropping hints about how high prices are
these days.

If you speak French, remember that overt is the same as the French
ouvert "open." If you don't speak French, give up all hope of ever
learning this word. Just kidding — forgive the overt attempt at humor.
English speakers, here's your trick for remembering the difference
between overt and covert: overt = "open"; covert = "covered."

Look at
people who support one party or the other, one ideology—a
noticeable orthodoxy or correctness prevails, without
anyone saying anything or applying overt pressure.
* elicit :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 16:37]

When you elicit, you're bringing out a response of some sort. A good
comedian elicits a lot of laughs.

Elicit has to do with creating or provoking a response. A great speech
will elicit cheers — a bad speech will elicit boos. Teachers try to
elicit responses from students. If a friend smiles at you, it will
probably elicit a smile of your own. In court, a lawyer might try to
elicit mistakes and inconsistencies in the testimony of a witness. In
all cases, whatever is elicited is some kind of response.

Mistakes and failures elicit the need to explain.
* ascribed :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 16:38]

Ascribe means to give credit to, like if you ascribe the A you got on
your group project to the hard work of your partners!

Ascribe's Latin root is ascribere, meaning basically "to write in.''
Makes sense, because ascribe is often used to link writers to their
words. Many a quirky quote, like "Age is an issue of mind over matter.
If you don't mind, it doesn't matter," is ascribed to that famous
scribe Mark Twain. It can also be a way of blaming something — you
might ascribe your bad attitude to your mom because she won't let you
have cupcakes for dinner.

But with the
passage of time, the pleasure principle rises and we forget
what small part in the mistake we ascribed to ourselves.
* upward :Greene:

If people truly learned from their experience,
we would find few mistakes in the world and career paths
that ascend ever upward.
* ascend :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 16:39]

To ascend is to move or travel upwards. You can do this literally,
like when you ascend to 35,000 feet after your plane takes off, or
figuratively, like when you win the lottery and ascend to a higher
social class.

Riding the escalators in the department store is one way to amuse
yourself while your parents shop. You can ascend all the way to the
8th floor, and then descend back to the ground floor. Both ascend and
descend come from the Latin verb scandere, which means "to climb."
It's the prefixes that make all the difference. The a- of ascend makes
the word mean "climb up," while the de- of its antonym makes descend
mean "climb down."

If people truly learned from their experience,
we would find few mistakes in the world and career paths
that ascend ever upward.
* lurch :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 16:41]

To lurch is to suddenly move — usually forward. If you are on a ship
that lurches a lot during a storm, you may find your body lurching in
one direction and your stomach going in the opposite one.

The verb lurch can refer to any abrupt movement, but it often has the
sense of a sharp turn up, down, or sideways. If you invest in the
stock market, you have to be prepared for sudden losses and gains as
the stock market can lurch up or down on a whim. The verb also means
to make sudden jerking movements when walking, as if you cannot
control your movements.

You might
make dates or appointments and leave them in the lurch,
or show up impossibly late with the sincerest of apologies,
laced with a touch of irony.
* brood :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 16:42]

A brood is a group of young born at the same time — like a brood of
chicks — but your parents might use the word for you and your
siblings: "We're taking the whole brood to the movies tonight."

Brood is also what a chicken does when she sits on her eggs to hatch
them. You can also brood, when you worry and sulk and dwell on
something obsessively — maybe as tedious as sitting on eggs, but no
chicks when you're done. Things like clouds or silence can also brood,
hanging over something ominously, as a storm that broods over the sea,
sending fishermen scurrying for safety.

Let them brood on what this
might mean.
* conscientious :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 16:57]

If someone is conscientious, that person strives to do what's right
and to carry out her duties. Conscientious people show care and put in
a big effort.

Being conscientious has to do with being careful, thoughtful, and
decent. A conscientious doctor will do everything possible to help a
patient. A conscientious teacher will spend extra time with students,
just to make sure they're learning. A boss wishes every worker could
be conscientious: it's a rare and wonderful trait. To be
conscientious, you have to be willing to do the right thing even when
it's difficult. Unfortunately, many people aren't conscientious.

They seem to be in favor of the noblest
causes, always presenting themselves as hardworking and
conscientious.
* possessed :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 17:21]

Someone who's possessed is completely controlled by some force. If
you've ever seen a crazed sports fan screaming with joy for the
winning team, you've seen a person possessed with team spirit.

While possessed is the past tense of the verb possess, to have, it
most often describes someone who's obsessed with something. The
controlling force can be an emotion, like when your friend is
possessed by her infatuation with her favorite pop star. It can also
be a supernatural power or demon — possessed describes someone you
believe is truly controlled by an evil spirit, or someone who just
acts that way.

In the middle of such an attack we feel
possessed, as if a second, limbic self has taken over.
* petty :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 17:31]

Petty used to mean just "petite" or "small," but now it's used for
things that are trivial and shouldn’t matter much. If you host world
leaders and spend more time picking napkins than memorizing names,
you're focused on petty things.

A few neutral meanings of petty are still in use today — such as
"petty cash," which refers to a small amount of cash on hand — but
most uses of petty since the 16th century are negative, as in
"narrow-minded," "trivial," and "of little importance." A "petty
argument" is a popular expression, because many people get all worked
up over something that isn't very important — a petty concern — that
seems much smaller after the heat of the moment.

They suddenly lash out in anger, reveal a paranoid streak,
and become hypersensitive and often petty.
* inveterate :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 17:35]

If you're an inveterate doodler, all your notebooks are covered with
drawings. If you're an inveterate golf player, you probably get
twitchy if you haven't been out on a course in a week.

Inveterate comes from the Latin root for “old,” and it describes old
habits. In Middle English the word was associated with chronic
disease. Now it simply refers to something that is a signature habit
with a person. If you’ve loved books ever since you were a toddler,
and you regularly check out big stacks from the library, you’re an
inveterate reader. And if you're an inveterate nail-biter, nothing can
cure you of the habit.

They
have an obsessive quality, and they can lead you to
extreme actions as a devoted follower or as an inveterate
enemy.
* rallied :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 17:38]

Use the verb rally to describe that last push to finish a difficult
something. When you hit that last mile in the race and are so tired
you want to quit, that's when you rally, finding the strength to pick
up the pace.

The verb rally is often used to describe a physical effort that has
been renewed, but it can describe anything that involves bouncing back
from a setback. For example, if something makes you feel disappointed,
you rally to get your positive attitude back. Rally can also describe
bringing people together, often to support a cause. The event itself
is also called a rally, like pep rally in which students boost the
confidence of their team as it heads into the championship game.

It is how we can be rallied to do
something for the collective good.
* inoculate :Greene:
[2020-09-23 Wed 17:39]

If you inoculate someone, you try to make him immune to a disease by
injecting a little dose of it, so his body can make antibodies to
fight it off. When you were little you probably got a vaccine to
inoculate you against smallpox.

When inoculate first came into English in the 15th century, it
referred to inserting a bud onto another plant. Now you’re more likely
to hear it used to describe the process of building up immunity to a
disease by giving someone a vaccine, which also involves the insertion
of foreign matter. You can also inoculate someone metaphorically, with
ideas.

But if you notice the
appeal is to more diabolical emotions, such as hatred of
the other, rabid patriotism, aggression, or sweeping
worldviews, you need to inoculate yourself and see through
the powerful pull as it works on you.
* gutsy :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:08]

If someone's gutsy, they're bold and spirited. The gutsy pilot Amelia
Earhart defied cultural expectations and braved dangerous situations
to set many records in aviation.

Beyond their courage and bravery, a gutsy person also has grit and
determination, often facing several challenges at once. A gutsy
athlete plays through pain, and a gutsy activist confronts challenges
head-on and keeps working for the cause she believes in. Around 1800,
gutsy meant "greedy," but by the end of the 19th century it came to be
defined as "brave and plucky," from the figurative "spirits or
courage" sense of guts.

It was the noblest of
noble gestures, the gutsy act of a born trouper, and I was
impressed by his courage—no, more than impressed: filled with
admiration—but the sad truth was that he was in no shape to
do what he did.
* overly :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:09]

I
don’t want to sound overly superstitious about it, but given
how things turned out, it feels that we were cursed, that no
matter what any of us did or didn’t do, the project was bound
to fail.
* palm :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:09]

Your palm is the inside part of your hand. When you clap, you smack
your palms together repeatedly.

Your palm extends from your wrist to your fingers. You can hold an
orange in your palm or rest your palm on your friend's feverish
forehead. Palm can also be a verb, meaning "steal" or "hide inside
your hand." So a magician might palm a coin in her palm, and a
shoplifter might palm a diamond ring in a jewelry store. Palm trees
are named for their leaves' similarity to the fingers of a large hand.

The performances had been
only part of the problem, and I wasn’t about to palm off
responsibility for what had happened on the director or the
actors.
* superfluous :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:10]

When something is so unnecessary that it could easily be done away
with, like a fifth wheel on a car or a fifth person on a double date,
call it superfluous.

Superfluous (soo-PER-floo-uhs) means "more than required." Use it when
pointing out something that could be removed without detracting from
the quality of something: "For a climb over a glacier, the very
thickest shoes are absolutely necessary; beyond these, all else seems
superfluous to me," wrote the adventurer Charles Stoddard in 1899. The
word comes from Latin and literally means "overflowing": super
("over") + fluere ("to flow"). So you can think of a superfluous
addition as flowing over the boundaries of what's needed.

I began
chopping and trimming, hacking away at everything that felt
weak or superfluous, and by the time I was finished, half of
the play was gone, one of the characters had been eliminated,
and the title had been changed.
* reconcile :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:10]

Reach for the verb reconcile to make different things come together or
resolve a matter.

If you've ever had an argument with someone and then made up, you have
reconciled. Reconcile is a verb that can mean "to become resigned"
like if you're reconciled to getting the bottom bunk when you wanted
the top. It also means to "bring into agreement and harmony." Words
like it are pacify, harmonize, and accommodate — reconcile is
definitely an agreeable word!

My old way of doing things had led to disaster, and
I was ripe for new ideas, a new way of tackling the dilemma
that had dogged me from the start: how to reconcile the needs
of the body with the needs of the soul.
* plunged :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:26]

Plunge is a noun and a verb related to diving, falling, and sinking. A
"polar bear plunge" is when people plunge into freezing cold water for
charity or, inexplicably, for fun.

As a noun, plunge means “a brief swim” or “a fall.” As a verb, plunge
has a variety of definitions. Plunge can mean “to devote yourself
fully," as you might plunge into a job by working day and night.
Similarly, if you plunge into a good book, you don't let anything
distract you from your reading. Plunge can also mean “fall abruptly.”
Someone’s reputation might plunge after a scandal, or the stock market
might plunge when investors react to bad news.

I had gone too far to
allow one setback to throw me off course, and so I put my
head down and plunged ahead.
* enthused :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:26]

He loved the game,
seemed genuinely enthused when I showed it to him, and made
an all-out effort to help.
* twinge :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:29]

A twinge is a sting or pang of pain that happens suddenly. Are you
recovering from a basketball injury? You may still feel a twinge of
discomfort in your knee when you do a layup.

You can experience a physically painful twinge, but there are also
twinges that are more emotional, like the twinge of sadness you feel
when you look at photos of your old house. Use this word as a verb,
too, if you like: "Did your shoulders twinge when you gave your little
brother a piggyback ride?" Long ago, to twinge meant to pinch, and the
word's origin traces back to the Old English twengan, "to pinch."

I never found out how
close George came to getting his idea through, but I must
confess (somewhat reluctantly) that I still find it hard to
look at a box of Wheaties without feeling a little twinge.
* hastened :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:30]

The verb hasten means to move at a high speed. If you hasten to your
room, no one will know that you came in late.

Hasten comes from the word haste, which means "excessive speed or
urgency." The words hurry and hasten are synonyms. Hasten can also
mean "to make happen quickly," like when you open a window in the
kitchen when you are cooking to hasten the room's cooling down. Hasten
also means "to be quick," like when you hasten to tell everyone that
the rumor going around about you isn't true.

As the man hastened to
explain to me when he finally wrote, he wasn’t entirely
responsible for the delay: “I am sorry to be so late in
acknowledging receipt of your June 22 letter and your game,
Action Baseball.
* insurmountable :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:32]

The adjective insurmountable describes some barrier that is incapable
of being overcome. The Great Wall of China was meant to be an
insurmountable deterrent to would-be invaders.

Although the adjective insurmountable can be used to describe an
actual physical barrier, it most often refers to a less tangible
challenge. "The runner was disheartened because her competitor had an
insurmountable lead in the race." "Because of insurmountable
difficulties, the school's fall party had to be canceled. The water
heater burst, raining gallons of water down on the gym, and flooding
it. Since it was not a swimming party, the school wasn't able to clean
up the mess in time to host the party."

There may well be a market for it since it is
the only table-top baseball game without a lot of trappings,
which makes it faster-moving, but the consensus here is that
without big league players and their statistics, the
established competition is insurmountable.”
* sallied :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:33]

A sally is a military action, a sudden charge in the direction of the
enemy. A sally sometimes has the advantage of taking the opposing army
by surprise.

When soldiers who have been on the defensive, having retreated to a
foxhole or fort, make an abrupt offensive attack on their opponents,
it's a sally. Another word for this kind of sally is a sortie. You can
also call a sudden funny remark or comeback a sally, especially during
a witty, back-and-forth, or bantering kind of conversation. The word
comes from the Middle French saillie, "a rushing forth," from the
Latin salire, "to leap."

Things stalled for a couple of months after that, but then
another lead materialized, and I picked up my lance and
sallied forth again.
* patter :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:34]

When something patters, it makes a light, rhythmic, tapping sound. On
a rainy night, you might love lying in bed listening to the rain
patter on the roof.

You can describe the way rain patters, or the way children's feet
patter down the hallway on Christmas morning. The light, quick sound
itself is also a patter: "Listen to the patter of sleet on the
window!" Informally, a salesman's pitch can be called patter as well,
from an older meaning, "talk rapidly," from pater, "mumble prayers
rapidly." The tapping kind of patter has a different root, which it
shares with pat.

He was a fast-talking wheeler-dealer of
around forty, a wholly antipathetical man with every kind of
bluff and angle up his sleeve, but I must admit that his
patter had some verve to it.
* verve :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:34]

If something has an energetic style or vitality, you can say it has
verve. Dancers are noted for their verve on the stage. Morticians? Not
so much.

Similar words to verve include vim, vigor, and élan. Verve comes from
the Latin root word verba, meaning "words," and in English originally
meant a special talent in writing. Although the "special talent" sense
is now archaic, verve is still an excellent choice to describe a
writing style.

He was a fast-talking wheeler-dealer of
around forty, a wholly antipathetical man with every kind of
bluff and angle up his sleeve, but I must admit that his
patter had some verve to it.
* bluff :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:35]

Bluff can mean a high cliff, or it can describe a person who is abrupt
in manner. The most common usage of bluff is as a verb meaning to
pretend. If you bluff at cards, you are pretending to have a better
hand than you do.

Many a good crime story ends with a bluff—"I've already contacted the
police and they're on their way," the detective will say when that is
not at all the case. The expression "calling your bluff" comes from
poker, where you "call" a game to see someone's actual cards. Calling
someone's bluff means forcing them to admit the truth.

He was a fast-talking wheeler-dealer of
around forty, a wholly antipathetical man with every kind of
bluff and angle up his sleeve, but I must admit that his
patter had some verve to it.
* numskull :Auster:

“In other words,” the man said, finally realizing what a
numskull he was talking to, “you’ve taken a shit, and now you
want someone to flush the toilet for you.”
* muddled :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:38]

Muddled things are all mixed-up and confused. Your mind might feel
muddled when you first wake up from a long nap.

Your school's football quarterback might get muddled and throw the
ball the wrong way. Or, your muddled French teacher could make the
class feel muddled too if she accidentally starts speaking German in
class. The verb muddle, "to make confused or disordered," originally
meant "destroy the clarity of," from its literal meaning, "to bathe in
mud."

That turned out to be my last move,
the final chapter of the whole muddled saga.
* spiel :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:38]

A spiel is a lengthy, often glib talk that's intended to persuade or
make excuses. Infomercials feature salespeople giving a 30-minute
spiel about some product.

Used as a noun or verb, spiel originates from the German word spielen,
meaning “to play." It's often somewhat rehearsed and should be greeted
with skepticism. Upon turning 16, your child might give you a spiel
about why they need a car for their birthday. In a political debate,
if your stance doesn't sound original, thoughtful, and earnest, it may
just come across as a spiel, leading your audience to think, "Oh,
brother, there they go again."

It sounded like her standard spiel, a
furious condensation of years of hard knocks and cutthroat
maneuvers, and for the first several minutes I couldn’t get a
word in edgewise.
* ludicrous :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:41]

Ludicrous things are funny, absurd, or nonsensical. If someone says
something silly or far-fetched, you could say "That's ludicrous!"

Ludicrous originally meant something that was funny, playful, or
joking: a ludicrous comment was just a really funny comment. Over
time, ludicrous took on a more negative flavor. Now a ludicrous
statement might be funny, but it's also ridiculous, hard to believe,
off the wall, or even stupid. When people say "That idea is
ludicrous!" it usually means the idea could never happen: the notion
is laughable. Saying Neil Armstrong was the third President would be a
ludicrous statement.

To count on it
as a source of money would have been an act of pure
self-deception, a ludicrous error.
* tangible :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:43]

When you can touch something, it's tangible: "I need tangible proof
that aliens exist — I want to shake their little green hands!"

Tangible is from Latin tangere, "to touch," and it simply means
something that can be touched or felt, though it can be used in
metaphorical senses: tangible assets have a value that can be
precisely measured, and tangible grief can be clearly sensed by an
onlooker. So you might not need to physically touch something for it
to be tangible, but it has to be grounded in the real world of facts:
"Has the teen pop star demonstrated any tangible ability to sing?"

I won’t go into the
depressing details now, but several months went by without
any tangible results.
* gimmicks :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:45]

A gimmick is a trick intended to attract attention. If you lure crowds
to your bake sale by having cute football players handing out samples
in front of your booth, that’s a gimmick.

A gimmick is often used by businesses to sell a product. As a sales
gimmick, your local bank might offer free microwave ovens to people
who open new savings accounts. A TV show may air a live episode as a
gimmick to get people to watch the show. The word sometimes has a
slightly negative connotation — there’s often some flashy trickery
involved in a gimmick and it doesn’t always add value to what’s being
sold.

One of the conventional plot gimmicks of these
stories was the apparent suicide that turns out to have been
a murder.
* ostensibly :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:46]

Ostensibly is an adverb you use to talk about something that looks one
way, but underneath there's the hint of a different motivation for
that action.

One day you go to an ice cream shop. Then the next day. And the next.
You keep going, ostensibly to buy ice cream, but there’s a deeper
reason. The cute person who works there, perhaps? To ostensibly do
something admits that the surface reason might not be the only reason.
The Latin root words translate as “to stretch in view of,” so imagine
that you’re stretching a thin mask over your true intentions.

Again and again, a character would ostensibly die
by his or her own hand, and by the end of the story, after
all the tangled strands of the intrigue had finally been
unraveled, it would be discovered that the villain was in
fact responsible for the character’s death.
* flutter :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:47]

Flutter means to move back and forth rapidly. Flags flutter in the
wind. Leaves flutter to the ground. Flutter also exists as a noun—you
might feel a flutter in your heart when you're excited.

To remember flutter, think of the children's rhyme, "See the butterfly
flutter by." Flutter is often paired with "flit," to describe the way
that birds and insects fly––they flit and flutter. It can also be used
to describe indecision—someone who can't make up their mind might
flutter between two choices.

It was no more than idle speculation, a two-in-the-morning
brain wave, but I couldn’t fall asleep, and with my heart
beginning to race and flutter in my chest, I pursued the
thought a little further, trying to calm myself by cooking up
a story to go with my curveball premise.
* groping :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 16:48]

I had no stake in
the results, was simply groping for a sedative to tranquilize
my nerves, but one piece of the puzzle kept fitting beside
another, and by the time I drifted off to sleep, I had worked
out the bare-bones plot of a mystery novel.
* rub :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 17:10]

To rub is to push firmly and repeatedly, like when you rub your sore
foot. When Hamlet says, "aye, there's the rub," he's not talking about
getting a massage. Rub, as a noun, is an obstacle or something in your
way.

You can rub someone's aching back or rub sunblock on your arms and
legs. You can also watch chunks of melting ice on a lake's surface rub
against each other or complain that your new shoes rub your heels and
give you blisters. Colloquially, you might rub off on your friends, or
begin to influence them by your mere presence. If, however, you rub
them the wrong way, you irritate or annoy them. The noun rub is not
used nearly as often as the verb, but people do love to allude to
Hamlet's "aye, there's the rub" line in the "to be or not to be"
soliloquy, referring to the unforeseen dreams of death that haunt
mankind.

The rub was that I didn’t have the first
idea how to find one.
* upheaval :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 17:13]

Upheaval means a violent or sudden change. You might talk about an
upheaval in government following an election where many incumbents are
replaced.

Upheaval is a geological term for the upward displacement of the
earth's crust that has stretched to include a change in power or
ideas. If you suddenly found out your favorite teacher was running a
pyramid scheme and had escaped to a Caribbean island, you might
experience an upheaval in your attitude toward teachers in general.

In the meantime, all sorts of
catastrophes occurred, one upheaval followed another, and the
last thing on my mind was the fate of my pseudonymous
potboiler.

My father died just two months after that—suddenly,
unexpectedly, without ever having been sick a day in his
life—and for many weeks the bulk of my time was spent taking
care of estate business, settling his affairs, tying up loose
ends.
* scarcely :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 17:15]

Scarcely means just before, hardly, or “almost not.” If you had
scarcely made it to bed when the sun started to rise, you are probably
pretty tired by now.

Scarcely may have just made it in the nick of time and by the skin of
its teeth, but it’s here now, even if it is just barely hanging on —-
which means you can scarcely accuse it of not showing up. Though an ly
adverb, scarcely is unusual in that it is not so much a descriptor of
its root adjective as a synonym of the adverb form scarce. If you
scarcely believe me, look it up for yourself!

He
was the friend of a friend, and since the meeting had taken
place a good eight or nine years earlier, I could scarcely
remember who he was.
* royalties :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 17:17]

Royalty is a good word for describing a family of kings, queens,
princes, and princesses. If you are in the music business, you may
expect a payment, or royalty every time your song is played. How's
that for royal treatment?

The noun royalty means a group of royals, or kings and their extended
families. Queen Elizabeth of England is a member of Britain's royalty,
for example. You can also use royalty to describe the payment a writer
receives whenever her book is sold, or that a musician gets when his
song is played in a grocery store. The word comes from the Latin
regalis, "regal," which in turn comes from rex, "king."

There was no advance, of course, no money up front,
but royalties would begin with the first copy sold.
* cough :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 17:18]

A cough is a reflex in which your throat or lungs are cleared by a
sudden, sharp burst of air escaping. A bad cough can make it very hard
to sleep at night.

A cough is evidence that someone's sick, and it's a verb as well: "She
began to cough and couldn't stop until someone brought her a bottle of
water." You can also describe a cough-like sound that an engine makes
when it's not working properly as a cough. The Old English source of
cough is coughen, from a Germanic root — every version of the word is
imitative, the word itself sounding like a cough.

I figured
that was normal for a new publisher just getting off the
ground, and since he had no investors or serious financial
support, he couldn’t very well cough up money he didn’t have.
* blanket :Auster:
[2020-09-24 Thu 17:19]

A blanket is a large piece of material that keeps you warm when you're
in bed or taking a nap on the couch. Many small children have a
favorite blanket that provides not just warmth, but comfort.

There is the knitted blanket on your bed, and then there's the blanket
of snow that covers your yard in January. Any heavy layer can be
described this way: "After a windy day, there was suddenly a blanket
of leaves outside." You can use it as a verb, too: "The fog descended
and began to blanket the whole town." The Old French root is blanchet,
"light wool or flannel cloth," from blanc, "white" or "white cloth."

Needless to say, his business didn’t quite qualify as a
commercial operation, but he was hoping it would become one,
and who was I to throw a wet blanket on his hopes?
* foremost :Greene:
[2020-09-25 Fri 16:04]

Foremost is an adjective that means holding the highest position or
rank. When naming advisors, presidents usually search for the foremost
experts on various subjects.

If you are the foremost in your profession, you're the expert people
will seek out for an opinion. If your foremost concern in a project is
money, all other factors are secondary. You can also use this word as
an adverb meaning "before anything else." The film, Gone With the
Wind, is set against the backdrop of the American Civil War, but first
and foremost, it is a love story.

First and foremost is the existence
throughout history and in all cultures of people of high
rationality, the types who have made progress possible.
* appraisal :Greene:
[2020-09-25 Fri 16:05]

An appraisal is a judgment of something, especially an estimate of how
much it's worth. Usually you need an expert to give an official
appraisal.

If you were selling a house, you'd need an expert in real estate to
give an appraisal of how much it's worth — that's an official estimate
of how much you could sell it for. But this word can also be used in
other less formal situations that call for a judgment or opinion of
some sort. If you painted a picture, you could ask, "What's your
appraisal of my work?" Hopefully the answer is "beautiful!"

All of these types share certain qualities—a realistic
appraisal of themselves and their weaknesses; a devotion
to truth and reality; a tolerant attitude toward people; and
the ability to reach goals that they have set.
* impels :Greene:
[2020-09-25 Fri 16:08]

Impel means to force to move forward. A person sleep walking might
move as if impelled by a force beyond their control. Loneliness might
impel you to talk to someone you don't know.

Impel derives from the Latin in- "toward" + pellere "to drive," which
also brings us compel "to force" and propel "to drive forward." The
boy was propelled by his fears, but when he said fear of bullies
impelled him to stay home on Halloween, his mother compelled him to
dress and go outside.

Look at
your decisions, especially those that have been
ineffective—can you see a pattern, an underlying
insecurity that impels them?
* resentment :Greene:
[2020-09-25 Fri 16:13]

Resentment, or the strong and painful bitterness you feel when someone
does something wrong to you, doesn’t have actual physical weight, but
it feels very heavy and can last a long time. Forgiveness is one way
to get rid of resentment.

Sometimes resentment lasts for years. It can be strong and hard to
pull out, like an old, gnarled tree root. While resentment over being
wronged can come from just one act against you, it also can get
stronger over time, as in "your growing resentment might just come
from the fact that the team captain always picks you last." It also
comes from misunderstandings, like feeling resentment over a dirty
look you thought was directed at you but really wasn't. It's usually
best to root out resentment early.

You do not
make phone calls or communicate while feeling some
sudden emotion, particularly resentment.
* dispassionately :Greene:
[2020-09-25 Fri 16:15]

This will calm you down and help you observe
people more dispassionately, understanding them on a
deeper level.
* mercilessly :Greene:
[2020-09-25 Fri 16:16]

To behave mercilessly is to act without showing pity or sympathy, like
a bully who torments other kids or a basketball team that beats the
opponent 125 – 0. Whenever possible, it’s best to avoid people who act
mercilessly.

When you show mercy, you're kind and empathetic. Without any mercy,
you’re merciless, and when you act this way you act mercilessly. You
show no pity! Some big brothers kid their little sisters mercilessly,
and a judge who gives the maximum sentence for a minor crime has ruled
mercilessly. Mercy is at the root of mercilessly, from the Old French
merci, which means both "thanks" and "pity." If people act
mercilessly, tell them thanks for nothing!

His family was large and poor,
and his father, an alcoholic, mercilessly beat all of the
children, including young Chekhov.
* immensely :Greene:
[2020-09-25 Fri 16:17]

Immensely is an adverb that means vastly, or very, or hugely. An
immensely good time is a really, really good time.

If you know that immense means huge, then you probably already have a
sense of what immensely means. It's a word for describing the enormous
degree of something. A New York Times bestseller is an immensely
popular book. Any offensive lineman is an immensely large human being.
The earth is immensely old. A mouse can't be described as doing
anything immensely, but an elephant does things immensely all the
time.

In his stories and plays, he found it
immensely therapeutic to get inside his characters and
make sense of even the worst types.
* brutes :Greene:
[2020-09-25 Fri 16:18]

His road rage may turn your dad into a brute when he gets behind the
wheel. A brute is a person who is as ferocious as a wild animal.

A violent, savage person can be described as a brute, and so can a
wild animal. Someone who's less monstrous but is still unpleasant can
also be a brute, and it can be used as an adjective to mean,
basically, "brutal." If it's more animal than human, you can call it
brute, like the brute power of an invading army. The Latin brutus,
"heavy, dull, or stupid," gave rise to brute, which through the 15th
century only referred to animals.

By stepping back and
imagining their story from the inside, Chekhov
demythologized the brutes and aggressors; he cut them
down to human size.

They no longer elicited hatred but
rather pity.
* intertwined :Greene:
[2020-09-25 Fri 16:19]

Things that intertwine are twisted or mixed together. You have to
intertwine yarn to make a scarf.

When things intertwine, they're all mixed up together — it's hard to
separate them. To make any type of clothing, threads have to be
intertwined. Rope is made of smaller fibers that intertwine. Related
jobs—like a writer and an editor—intertwine too, because they are so
closely related. You can say people are intertwined if they're close
to each other, as family or friends. Getting intertwined could be a
metaphor for getting married; the threads of your lives are getting
tangled together.

The two are
completely intertwined.

The horse is our emotional nature continually impelling us
to move.
* ascetic :Greene:
[2020-09-25 Fri 16:24]

Want to live an ascetic lifestyle? Then you better ditch the flat
panel TV and fuzzy slippers. To be ascetic, you learn to live without;
it's all about self-denial.

Ascetic is derived from the Greek asketes, meaning “monk,” or
“hermit.” Later that became asketikos, meaning “rigorously
self-disciplined,” which gives us the Modern English ascetic. Ascetic
can be a noun: a person with incredible self-discipline and the
ability to deprive herself, or an adjective that describes such a
people or their lifestyle.

It is important to not see the path to
rationality as something painful and ascetic.

We must recognize at the same time the
toxic narcissists among us before getting enmeshed in
their dramas and poisoned by their envy.
* discrepancy :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 09:58]

A discrepancy is a lack of agreement or balance. If there is a
discrepancy between the money you earned and the number on your
paycheck, you should complain to your boss.

There is a discrepancy when there is a difference between two things
that should be alike. For example, there can be a wide discrepancy or
a slight discrepancy between two objects, stories, or facts. The noun
discrepancy is from Latin discrepare "to sound differently," from the
prefix dis- "from" plus crepare "to rattle, creak."

We cannot go
too far in this, for if our self-image is too
divorced from reality, other people will make us
aware of the discrepancy, and we will doubt
ourselves.
* encourage :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 10:02]

When you encourage someone, you give him or her the courage or
confidence to do something, like when you encourage your little
brother to play harder by yelling his name from the sidelines of the
soccer field.

The word encourage comes from the Old French word encoragier, meaning
"make strong, hearten." When you encourage the tomato plants in your
garden, you water them to promote their growth and health. Encourage
can also mean to inspire with hope, like when you encourage your
friends to try out for the school play by complimenting their singing
and acting talents.

Their mothers (or fathers) might be deep narcissists
themselves, too self-absorbed to acknowledge the
child, to encourage its early efforts at
independence.
* vivacious :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 10:33]

A vivacious person is lively and spirited: a vivacious dancer might do
a back-flip off the wall and then jump into the arms of her partner.

Some people are just naturally fun to be around; they sparkle, they
animate any group they're part of, they're full of life. That, in
fact, is the root meaning of the word: it's from Latin vivere "to
live." It has more of a sense of playfulness than lively or animated.
Even the most sedentary slob can feel revitalized in the presence of a
vivacious soul.

They can appear vivacious and
exciting.
* worthy :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 10:38]

Use the adjective worthy to describe the good causes to which you
donate a little money each year. Their admirable qualities are what
make them worthy.

Something that deserves respect is worthy, whether it's a charity, a
hard working tennis opponent, or a struggle to overcome a disability.
If it's worth your admiration or has some inherent value, it's worthy.
The word has been around since the thirteenth century, and it was
especially common in the 1300's to use worthy as a noun meaning
"person of merit."

But underneath the surface,
they are becoming dangerously addicted to the hits of
attention they stimulate to make them feel whole and
worthy.
* loathing :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 10:38]

Loathing is a feeling of complete disgust. Your loathing of the
feeling of sand between your toes means that going to the beach isn't
much fun for you.

If you have an utterly disgusted hatred of something, you have a
loathing for it. A loathing of green vegetables can result in
nutritional problems, and a loathing of little kids would make a
person a pretty terrible babysitter. To loathe something is to abhor
or strongly dislike it; the Old English root of both loathe and
loathing is laðian, to be disgusted with.

Since they will not get
validation of this self-image from others because it
is so unrealistic, they will also have moments of
great doubt and even self-loathing.
* righteousness :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 10:41]

Righteousness is a feeling or way of life that is all about doing the
right thing: righteousness shows great concern for morals and ethics.

Righteousness may sound like an old-fashioned word, but it's a
timeless concept. As you can tell from seeing the word right, this is
a word about taking a stand and doing the right thing. Trying to help
poor, oppressed people is a cause full of righteousness. Doing an
unpopular thing that is ethical requires righteousness. People like
Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela definitely walked the path of
righteousness.

They generally
react with great rage, thirsting for vengeance, full
of a sense of righteousness.
* assuage :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 10:41]

If you assuage an unpleasant feeling, you make it go away. Assuaging
your hunger by eating a bag of marshmallows may cause you other
unpleasant feelings.

The most common things that we assuage are fears, concerns, guilt,
grief, anxiety, and anger. That makes a lot of sense — these are all
things we seek relief from. The word comes from Old French assouagier,
from the Latin root suavis, "sweet" — think of adding a bit of honey
to something unpleasant. A word with a similar meaning is mollify.

This is the only way
they know how to assuage their insecurities.
* volatile :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 10:53]

Watch out when a situation becomes volatile — it is likely to change
for the worse suddenly. If you and your best friend have a volatile
relationship, you frequently fight and make up.

Volatile from Latin volatilis, "fleeting, transitory," always gives
the sense of sudden, radical change. Think of it as the opposite of
stable. A person who is volatile loses his or her temper suddenly and
violently. A volatile political situation could erupt into civil war.
When the stock market is volatile, it fluctuates greatly. And in
scientific language, a volatile oil evaporates quickly.

Some highly talented deep narcissists (see stories
starting on this page for examples) manage to find
some redemption through their work, channeling their
energies and getting the attention they crave through
their accomplishments, although they tend to remain
quite erratic and volatile.
* funnel :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 10:59]

The cone-shaped tool you use to pour liquid into a small hole is a
funnel. The swirling winds of a tornado make the shape of a funnel.
This is why they are called funnel clouds.

You can also use the word metaphorically to describe something that
goes from wide to narrow while moving. If six lanes of traffic must
funnel through a tunnel, you'll probably see a traffic jam. And if you
photographed the scene from above, the cars would make a triangular
shape, as if they formed a flat funnel. If a company is funneling
money into research and development, it is spending lots of money in
that department. Funnel cake is made by pouring batter through a
funnel in to hot oil. Yum!

They
generally have more ambition than the average deep
narcissist and for a while can funnel this energy
into work.
* admirable :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 11:00]

Someone who deserves your admiration can be described as admirable.
Your friend who saves homeless kittens in his spare time? An admirable
person.

An action can be admirable, like when you stop to help someone who's
slipped and fallen on an icy sidewalk. A person can also be admirable,
like your uncle who works building schools in Sri Lanka. If you admire
someone for a good reason, that makes them admirable, or deserving of
your respect and admiration. When you pronounce admirable, you stress
the first syllable, ad, unlike admire, which has the emphasis on the
last syllable, mire.

They say and do
things that other people don’t dare say or do, which
seems admirable and authentic.
* radiate :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 11:00]

When something radiates, it sends out waves or rays. The sun radiates
light and warmth.

If your house has a radiator, that might help you remember this word,
because the radiator radiates warmth. Radiating is a concept that
applies to anything that emits rays or waves. People camping make a
fire so it can radiate light and heat. Our bodies radiate some heat,
but not nearly as much as something as hot as a stove. If a nuclear
reactor is damaged, it could radiate dangerous nuclear energy — or
radiation.

They might have a
vision for some innovative product, and because they
radiate such confidence, they can find others to help
them realize their vision.
* dares :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 11:01]

When you challenge or provoke someone to try something risky, it's a
dare. If you accept a dare, you're probably trying to prove how brave
you are.

When you challenge your friend to a dare, you dare him. You might, for
example, dare your brother to jump off the garage into a pile of
leaves. Another way to dare is to actually be brave: "I admire her so
much, because she dares to stand up to bullies." The Old English root
of dare is durran, "to brave danger, venture, or presume." If you say,
"How dare you?" you're expressing outrage or indignation.

If
anyone dares to challenge them, they are more prone
than others to go into that deep narcissistic rage.
* flair :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 11:02]

Use the word flair to refer to someone’s knack or natural talent for
something. Someone might have a flair for throwing fantastic parties,
or a flair for solving complex math problems.

Something or someone with flair is flashy, catchy and full of energy.
But oddly enough, flair meant "odor" when it originated in the mid
14th century. It wasn’t until 1925 that the word came to mean a
distinctive talent, elegant style or dashing ability. So maybe think
of someone absolutely reeking of style and panache — but in a good
way.

They can have creative flair as
well.
* plummeting :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 11:04]

The verb plummet means "to drop sharply," like eagles that plummet
toward earth, seeking prey, or school attendance that plummets when
there is a flu outbreak.

To correctly pronounce plummet, say "PLUH-met." This verb describes
something that drops sharply or quickly, like a roller coaster that
plummets down a hill, temperatures that plummet overnight, or sales of
roses and candy that plummet after Valentine's Day. If something
plummets, this doesn't mean it will stay down or low forever, just
that it has experienced a sharp drop.

If for a moment they manage to engage with
others, some comment or action will trigger their
insecurities and they will go plummeting down.
* threefold :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 11:07]

Our task, as students of human nature, is threefold.
* inflict :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 11:07]

When you force an undesirable or harmful event on someone, you inflict
it on them. You might prefer that someone inflict some physical pain
on you rather than inflict you with the boredom of another trip to the
annual flower show.

The verb inflict comes from the Latin word inflictus, meaning “to
strike or dash against.” If you cause anything bad to happen to a
person, animal, or even an object, you inflict that badness on them.
For example, someone can inflict injuries or suffering on other people
or inflict damage on property. We can inflict pollution or
over-development on our environment. It's always a negative thing —
you wouldn't say you inflict happiness or love on others.

Although they are in the minority,
some of them can inflict an unusual amount of harm in
the world.
* disengage :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 11:08]

To disengage means to "free or disentangle" yourself or some object
from another person or object. No, it doesn't mean breaking off your
engagement to your beloved — that's "chickening out."

Does your mind wander when someone (your fiancé, for example) talks to
you? Well, your mind can disengage as well, that is, stop paying
attention. Disengage has quite a formal, intellectual ring to it, even
if used about a situation as physical as two armies "disengaging from
combat." It's a technical term, and faintly clinical; the kind of word
frequently used by politicians and diplomats.

They can
draw us in with their unusual energy, but if we
become enmeshed, it can be a nightmare to disengage.
* assertive :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 11:09]

If you are upfront about what you want and bold in devising a plan
that helps you get it, you could be described as assertive, meaning
you act with authority and confidence.

English offers many ways to describe getting what you want —
demanding, insistent, and pushy are a few of them. People who are
assertive aren't as aggressive as those who are demanding and pushy,
and they can negotiate a little better than those who are insistent.
Use assertive to describe someone who is self-confident enough to make
bold statements and forceful actions. The word can also be applied to
nonhuman things, like policies and strategies.

If we happen to be assertive, we see
assertiveness as a positive quality because it is
ours, whereas others, more timid, will rate it as
obnoxious and value introspective qualities.
* obnoxious :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 11:10]

If something is obnoxious, it's annoying and unpleasant. Generally,
people like to avoid obnoxious folks.

If something is driving you absolutely crazy, it's probably obnoxious.
Yelling and stomping your feet is obnoxious. Poking someone repeatedly
is obnoxious. Driving like a maniac is obnoxious. If the teacher comes
in and finds students jumping up and down and throwing books, she
might say, "Stop being so obnoxious!" Any time someone is obnoxious,
someone else probably wants them to stop it.

If we happen to be assertive, we see
assertiveness as a positive quality because it is
ours, whereas others, more timid, will rate it as
obnoxious and value introspective qualities.
* hover :Greene:
[2020-09-28 Mon 11:38]

A hover craft flies low over the ground or water — it hovers. Hover
can also mean waver. Think of someone that can’t decide exactly where
to land.

To help remember the meaning of hover, think of it as containing the
preposition over: things that hover hang over. A temperature can hover
around forty degrees, a grade in a class can hover around a B.

They tend to hover closer to the top
of the scale.
* flitting :Greene:
[2020-09-30 Wed 12:31]

A flit is a quick movement. You might flit around a crowded party,
greeting everyone briefly with some light-hearted chatter and moving
on quickly.

Whether it's used to describe something literal or figurative, flit
refers to something fleeting and quick. Flit and fleet are both
related to float. Something that floats keeps moving. A smile might
flit across your face or a thought may flit into your mind. That means
the smile or the thought is there for a second and then gone.

You
are continually drawn back to yourself, flitting
about the surface of social interactions, never
really engaging.
* placate :Greene:
[2020-09-30 Wed 12:31]

If you placate someone, you stop them from being angry by giving them
something or doing something that pleases them. If your dad is annoyed
that you forgot to take out the trash, you might be able to placate
him by doing the dishes.

If your little sister is mad that the dog ate her favorite teddy bear,
you could placate her by buying her an ice cream cone. A near synonym
for placate is appease. The origin of placate is Latin placare, "to
calm or soothe." The related Latin verb placere is the source of
English please.

People come to serve a
function—not to bond with but to placate your
insecurities.
* peculiar :Greene:
[2020-09-30 Wed 12:34]

Something peculiar is notably unusual. If your friend starts saying
strange things you don't understand, ask her why she's suddenly become
peculiar.

Peculiar comes from the Latin peculiaris, meaning one's own, or
personal. In English, it originally meant belonging to one person,
private, like your fondness for your peculiar hairbrush. It also had
the meaning of something unlike others, special, or remarkable.
Eventually we mostly stopped using it for belongings, instead using
peculiar to mean unusual or odd.

Each side of the spectrum has
its peculiar momentum.

Empathy creates its own upward,
positive momentum.
* snap :Greene:
[2020-09-30 Wed 12:36]

Oh, snap! When something snaps, it breaks or separates suddenly, often
with a cracking sound. A snap can also be a fastener on clothes. And
if you like a song, you can snap your fingers to the beat or snap a
selfie of yourself dancing.

The verb snap is useful for many things that make a similar sharp
sound, like when you snap your lunchbox shut, snap your fingers, or
snap a whip. An animal's quick, strong bite is also a snap. As a noun,
it can mean "fastener" or "the sound of a snap." A snap judgment is a
decision you make almost instantaneously, and a cold snap is a short
period of bitter weather.

Let go of your tendency
to make snap judgments.
* numerous :Greene:
[2020-09-30 Wed 12:38]

Numerous means very large in quantity. You wouldn’t use numerous to
describe how many feet you have (just two), but you could use it to
describe the infinite number of shoes in your closet.

The adjective numerous is related to the word number — which is no big
surprise since it basically means "a large number of something." Use
numerous to describe a copious or abundant amount that you can't give
a specific number for. Numerous fans probably come out for the
all-star game, for example. And numerous players wish they made the
all-star team.

The best place to begin this transformation in your
attitude is in your numerous daily conversations.
* indulgence :Greene:
[2020-09-30 Wed 12:39]

An indulgence is doing something that you enjoy even if it has
negative consequences. Buying yourself something that you don't need,
be it a cookie, video game, or diamond necklace, is an indulgence.

If you allow yourself to eat more chocolate cake or watch more TV than
is really good for you, those are your little indulgences. If you
spend your life savings on a trip to Tahiti, that’s a huge indulgence.
If someone says to you, "Grant me this indulgence," prepare for a
long-winded story that tries to convince you of something. Long, long
ago the Catholic Church sold something called "indulgences": pardons
for sins.

As part of this attitude, you are giving people the
same level of indulgence that you give yourself.

Visceral empathy: Empathy is an instrument of
emotional attunement.
* permeable :Greene:
[2020-09-30 Wed 12:42]

Something that is permeable can be passed through, especially by
liquids or gases. "I wish I hadn't worn my permeable sweater to the
picnic when the weatherman called for thunderstorms. The rain seeped
right through the fabric, soaking me to the skin."

A permeable surface allows materials like liquids to pass through —
either in or out. Inside the body, the walls of cells are permeable
membranes that allow fluids and nutrients to get in and nourish the
cells. A permeable shirt is good to wear in the summer, because it
helps release the sweat sticking to the skin.

The physical boundaries between us and other
people are much more permeable than we realize.

This
will register to you viscerally, in your own physical
response to them.
* winces :Greene:
[2020-09-30 Wed 12:47]

A wince is a facial or bodily expression of pain, disgust, or regret.
Think of something you've done that was really, really embarrassing or
dumb: now feel your face or take a look in the mirror as you wince at
the uncomfortable memory.

A moment of pain or a recollection of something painful can make you
wince. It's hard not to have a physical response or a wince with a bad
memory or a hurt. And wince is both a verb and a noun, so it can be an
action or a result. Sometimes people don’t do anything or have any
physical pain, but they wince in discomfort at what someone else does
or says, as when no one laughs after a really inappropriate joke.

When someone smiles or
winces in pain, they tend to unconsciously imitate
the expression, giving them a feel for what others
are feeling.

You can consciously use this power in trying to
get into the emotions of others, either by literally
mimicking their facial gestures or by conjuring up
memories of similar experiences that stirred such
emotions.
* witty :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:09]

A witty remark is clever and funny and timed just right. When you make
such a remark, you are also considered to be witty.

The adjective witty can be used to describe those quick little funny
remarks that often demonstrate a sharp, biting humor delivered in a
playful manner. Witty usually describes things that are off-the-cuff
amusing, rather than remarks that are elaborate or carefully planned
in advance. This adjective is usually used in a complimentary way,
but, like its cousin clever, it can be used sarcastically, as when
someone who doesn't appreciate your one-liners says, "Well, aren't we
witty today."

Franklin’s witty aphorisms make it hard to
believe he wasn’t a “natural” writer from the
very start.

Or, in Allen’s snappier formulation, “Eighty
percent of success in life is showing up.”
* swift :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:12]

If you were the first one to reach the finish line in gym class, the
coach might have called you swift. Swift means quick or fast-moving. A
glance, a current, even a decision can be swift.

You can use the adjective swift to describe things that move or happen
rapidly and smoothly. Deciding to borrow a parent's car without
permission could result in swift punishment. Foxes are so swift that
if you leave the chicken coop open for a moment, one might slip in.
Conversely, if innuendo sails over your head, your friends might say,
“You’re not too swift on the uptake, are you?” A swift is also a small
bird that looks a lot like a swallow.

A related problem, Barry says, is the
mythology that falling in love with a career
should be sudden and swift: “There are a lot
of things where the subtleties and
exhilarations come with sticking with it for
a while, getting elbow-deep into something.
* posture :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:13]

Posture is the way you position your body or arrange your limbs. So
stand up straight, put your shoulders back, and lift that chin up.

Ballerinas have an elegant, graceful posture, and soldiers tend to
display a rigid, strong posture. If you sit hunched over your desk
every day you'll end up with terrible posture. This noun describes the
way you carry yourself, but can also describe a certain body position
you take, like the different postures in yoga. If you're accused of
posturing though, that's a different story — that means you're
behaving unnaturally to impress someone.

Around that time, it wasn’t just Mike
Matthews who was talking to me about this
kind of hang-in-there posture toward
challenge.
* plummets :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:15]

The verb plummet means "to drop sharply," like eagles that plummet
toward earth, seeking prey, or school attendance that plummets when
there is a flu outbreak.

To correctly pronounce plummet, say "PLUH-met." This verb describes
something that drops sharply or quickly, like a roller coaster that
plummets down a hill, temperatures that plummet overnight, or sales of
roses and candy that plummet after Valentine's Day. If something
plummets, this doesn't mean it will stay down or low forever, just
that it has experienced a sharp drop.

Because when you
don’t come back the next day—when you
permanently turn your back on a
commitment—your effort plummets to zero.
* ponder :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:16]

"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary" is the
first line of Edgar Allan Poe's poem The Raven. Many a deep thinker
has repeated it while musing. But if you've given up deep thinking,
you may say instead, "Nevermore."

Think of ponder as reflecting on weighty thoughts. It will help you
remember the definition if you can remember the word's Latin roots. It
comes from ponderare, which literally meant to weigh, and pondus,
which means weight. People sometimes use the word ironically, for
example, when someone asks you to do something you really don't want
to do. You may tap your chin for a second and say, "Let me ponder
that." Pause. "Um, no!"

That gave me time to ponder the irony
of the situation.
* winnowed :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:16]

To winnow is to blow something away until you are left with what you
want, like grain from chaff. If you only want your favorite people to
attend your party, you will need to winnow down the guest list from
300 to 30.

To winnow is to use air to “separate the wheat from the chaff" —
literally or figuratively. If a coach winnows down the top NBA draft
picks to his number one choice, then he'll focus his negotiations on
that player. Chances are, if you encounter the word winnow on a given
day, it is probably not in the literal context of grain.

This pool is winnowed to
just 4,000 who succeed in getting the
required nomination.
* varsity :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:16]

The word varsity identifies the starting team in a sport at a college
or university. You have to be good to make varsity.

At many schools, sports are a big deal. Thousands of people flock to
college football and basketball games, plus other sports. The members
of the starting team are varsity players. Varsity players are the best
players: that’s why they start, and they usually finish the game too.
It can take a while for a player to make varsity status.

Nearly all
the men and women who come to West Point were
varsity athletes; most were team captains.
* attrition :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:17]

Attrition is a gradual process of wearing down, weakening, or
destroying something.

When a company wants to reduce its payroll without firing anyone, it
will sometimes do so through attrition; that is, by waiting for people
to retire or quit without hiring anyone new to replace them. In a more
general sense, the word means break down, wear out, or reduce in
numbers. A triple overtime basketball game, with many players fouling
out, is a war of attrition. When you see the word attrition, think
"Gradually chipping away."

Last year, attrition was down to
less than 2 percent.
* harrowing :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:18]

Being attacked by a hungry shark or being chased by an unruly mob on
the streets can be described as harrowing, which means "provoking
feelings of fear or horror."

The adjective harrowing is often used to describe a firsthand
experience that is terrifying, such as a harrowing drive home in icy
weather, but it can also refer to a secondhand experience, such as
reading or watching something that is very frightening or disturbing.
If you read someone’s account of being shipwrecked in Antarctica, you
might describe that as a harrowing story. A harrowing experience
typically unfolds over a period of time. For example, if you bump into
a shark while swimming, that’s merely scary. If the shark attacks you,
then it becomes a harrowing ordeal.

While the rigors of his induction
weren’t quite as harrowing as those of West
Point, there were notable similarities.
* paragons :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:19]

Paragon applies to someone who is a model of perfection in some
quality or trait. We link paragon with other words that follow it,
such as "paragon of virtue" or "paragon of patience."

A paragon means someone or something that is the very best. The
English noun paragon comes from the Italian word paragone, which is a
touchstone, a black stone that is used to tell the quality of gold.
You rub the gold on the touchstone and you can find out how good the
gold is. You are hoping that it is the paragon of "goldness."

The
highly accomplished were paragons of
perseverance.
* complacent :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:20]

Someone who is complacent has become overly content — the
junk-food-eating couch potato might be feeling complacent about his
health.

The literal meaning of this word's Latin root is "very pleased," but
even though complacent people may seem pleased with themselves, we are
rarely pleased with them. They are unconcerned by things that should
concern them, and they may neglect their duties. A complacent person
might be heard saying, "Ehh, don't worry about it!" — when there
really is something to worry about.

They were the opposite of
complacent.
* dogged :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:20]

Someone who's dogged is stubbornly persistent. In the old Looney Tunes
cartoons, Wile E. Coyote's pursuit of the Road Runner is dogged. He
simply will not give up.

You can see the word dog within the word dogged. It's no trick. If
you're dogged, you are as obstinate and tenacious as a dog who smells
a bone. An earlier definition of this adjective was more general,
meaning "having the qualities of a dog." Today, though, if someone
describes you as dogged, they simply mean that you won't stop until
you get what you want.

Why were the highly accomplished so dogged in
their pursuits?
* enduring :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:21]

Many people have an enduring love for ice cream, that is, they have
loved it for a long time and will continue to love it into the future.
Enduring means long-lasting.

Enduring has roots that go back about 1,500 years to the Late Latin
period. It is quite an enduring word! The original root meant hard, so
your enduring friendship or your enduring interest in sports is solid
enough to stand the test of time. Besides meaning long-lasting,
enduring sometimes means long-suffering as when someone has an
enduring disposition, but this meaning is found in the verb more than
in the adjective.

Their passion was enduring.
* determination :Angela:

Determination can be a decision, or the focus you need to get
something done.

The sense of determination, as making up your mind about something,
finds its roots in an Old French word meaning “decision," such as the
judge's determination that the man was guilty, or the panel's
determination that the chocolate was too bitter. Usually the decision
comes after much consideration and research, like when Copernicus made
the determination that the earth revolves around the sun. The word has
come to mean also grit, gumption, pluck, persistence: "With hard work
and determination, they were able finish the school project on time."

In sum, no matter the domain, the highly
successful had a kind of ferocious
determination that played out in two ways.
* verbatim :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:22]

Repeat something you've read or heard precisely word-for-word, and you
have just quoted it verbatim. That's great if what you deliver
verbatim is the directions on how to defuse a bomb, but not a good
idea if you're cheating on a test and copying someone's answer
verbatim.

As a word, verbatim is powerful for its precision. When you can say
that you are repeating someone's words verbatim, it means every single
word is exactly what was said. If you write something down verbatim,
you can rely on it being a duplicate of the original document,
recreated. Repeating words verbatim in your own writing can be tricky
business. Without attributing the original author, verbatim can be the
damning evidence of plagiarism.

And I started writing questions that
captured, sometimes verbatim, descriptions of
what it means to have grit.
* bore :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:24]

If your friends fall asleep every time you open your mouth, you might
be a bore — someone who makes the people around them bored.

In 1738, Voltaire wisely wrote, “The secret of being a bore is to tell
everything.” But the word bore is less boring than you think, since it
can function as both noun and verb. You can bore a hole into something
by drilling through it with a tool, and you can also bore people by
being excessively dull, repetitive, or tedious to be around. And don't
forget the bore of a needle or gun barrel, which is the same as its
diameter.

Grit
scores bore absolutely no relationship to the
Whole Candidate Scores that had been so
painstakingly calculated during the
admissions process.
* conscientiousness :Angela:

Moreover, no other commonly measured
personality trait—including extroversion,
emotional stability, and
conscientiousness—was as effective as grit in
predicting job retention.
* defy :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:25]

To defy is to openly refuse to do something. You can defy the
no-costumes-in-class rule if you wear your fairy wings to school, but
just don’t try to defy the laws of gravity unless you can actually
fly.

If you deliberately break a rule or ignore an order, you defy, or
resist, that rule. The word defy comes from the Latin word disfidare
for "renounce one's faith." So if you're expected to be faithful to a
certain law or rule but you refuse to be, you defy it. There are
different ways to defy — defy your parents by staying out past curfew,
or defy common sense by walking in with shoes on your head.

Those who defy the odds
are especially gritty.
* grueling :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:26]

If a job is grueling, that means it is really difficult. If a race is
grueling, that means it is really difficult. If a trip to the dentist
is grueling, that means you need to toughen up.

Once upon a time in a land far far away (like eighteenth century
England) there was an expression, to “get one’s gruel,” which meant
“receive one’s punishment.” This saying morphed into the word
grueling, which can be applied to any punishing activity. Presumably,
to “get one’s gruel” involved horrible punishments, but now the more
pampered among us might even find a long tennis match grueling.

Training for the Green Berets is a grueling,
multistage affair.
* precocious :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:26]

That high school hoops phenom who plays like an NBA pro? The sixth
grader who's already asking questions about organic chemistry? They're
both precocious — meaning they're way beyond their years in skill or
knowledge.

When you look at the Latin roots of precocious, it all makes sense.
When pre (meaning "before") joins coquere (meaning "to ripen"), you
have something that is ripening prematurely. And in the case of
precocious, you are usually describing young people who have some
adult-like quality about them. Maybe it's their vast vocabulary, maybe
it's their ease with Calculus, or maybe it's just applying lipstick.

Spellbound got me wondering: To what extent
is flawlessly spelling words like schottische
and cymotrichous a matter of precocious
verbal talent, and to what extent is grit at
play?
* princely :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:27]

Something princely is controlled by or suits a prince, like a princely
territory or a princely velvet cape.

If a prince (a male royal, often the son of a king or queen) rules
certain areas, they are princely territories. And if a prince wears
certain clothes, you could say he sports a princely outfit. You can
also use this adjective to mean "fancy" or "opulent," so you might
describe the princely furnishings in your elegant hotel room or the
princely offerings on the menu at a four-star restaurant.

In return for the princely
reward of a $25 gift card, about two-thirds
of the spellers returned the questionnaires
to my lab.
* lackluster :Angela:
[2020-09-30 Wed 13:27]

Lackluster is a compound adjective that means what it sounds like: if
something is lackluster it lacks luster; in other words, it is without
brilliance, shine, or vitality. Think dull.

Shakespeare gave us the compound lackluster, first using the term in
his play As You Like It. In 2:7, the character Jacques says, "And then
he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre
eye..." Since Shakespeare first coined this word, it has been used to
describe anything "blah"; lackluster sales would worry shop owners and
a lackluster prom dress might help you blend in with the wallpaper.

But more than a few of my most
talented students were earning lackluster
grades or worse.
