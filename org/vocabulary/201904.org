* thoracic :Titans:
[2019-04-03 Wed 14:13]

Thoracic is a medical word for things pertaining to the thorax area of
your body: your chest.

You’re likely to see the word thoracic in biology class. The thorax is
your chest: the area between your neck and abdomen. Therefore, this
area is the thoracic region, and that word can be used for issues
dealing with this area. Certain exercises are thoracic because they
strengthen your chest muscles. Your pectoral muscles are in the
thoracic area. Your heart is the most important part of the thoracic
area. If you have thoracic pains, you should see a doctor.

This can perform miracles for thoracic,
or mid-back, mobility, all while helping the hamstrings
in the pike position.
* compound :eww:
[2019-04-03 Wed 17:05]

If you compound a problem you add something to it to make it worse,
like say, putting water on a grease fire. Compound means to combine; a
compound is a combination or mixture of two or more things.

Compound has several specialized uses. A compound is either a mixture
or two or more things, or a heavily guarded residence, such as a drug
lord might have. In botany, a compound leaf consists of more than one
part. In linguistics, a compound is a word that consists of two or
more independent words. In chemistry, a compound is a substance
created when atoms from chemical elements join together.

Because you have the ability to compound
  more than older people.
* cheat :eww:
[2019-04-03 Wed 17:08]

To cheat is to use sneaky, unfair methods to get something you want.
No one's going to want to play with you if you always cheat at mini
golf.

Some people cheat at cards, and others cheat during math tests by
copying from the student beside them. In either case, they're trying
to succeed using underhanded tricks. You can refer to someone who does
this as a cheat as well. Cheat comes from the Old French escheat, a
legal term for the state taking someone's property when he or she dies
without heirs. This practice was resented, and it came to mean
"confiscate unfairly."

25 Husbands cheat on their wives.
* pertaining :eww:
[2019-04-16 Tue 08:18]

To pertain is to be relevant or somehow associated with something. If
you're a lawyer, you try to find evidence that will pertain to the
case and eliminate anything that is not connected.

Behind the verb pertain lies the Latin verb pertinēre, which means "to
be applicable" or "to hold through." If you think the rules of the
road don't pertain to you, try explaining that to the state trooper
when you get pulled over. Usage note: The word pertain often takes an
s at the end, as in "That pertains to this matter," but loses it with
a helper: “That doesn’t pertain to it.”

5 Learn something pertaining to your career every day of the week.

* reconnaissance :eww:
[2019-04-16 Tue 08:21]

Reconnaissance is checking out a situation before taking action. Often
it’s used as a military term, but you could also do reconnaissance on
a new employee before you hire her, or a resort before you take a
vacation.

Reconnaissance is a noun, and it technically means “the act of
reconnoitering.” Whoa. Never heard that word before? Reconnoitering is
just a fancy way of saying that you’re checking something out —
sometimes in a sneaky way. If you like a girl in your Spanish class,
you might ask a friend to do some reconnaissance to find out what
she’s like. The word comes from the French reconnaître, which means
“recognize.”

Think of it as
  reconnaissance.
* dare :eww:
[2019-04-16 Tue 08:25]

When you challenge or provoke someone to try something risky, it's a
dare. If you accept a dare, you're probably trying to prove how brave
you are.

When you challenge your friend to a dare, you dare him. You might, for
example, dare your brother to jump off the garage into a pile of
leaves. Another way to dare is to actually be brave: "I admire her so
much, because she dares to stand up to bullies." The Old English root
of dare is durran, "to brave danger, venture, or presume." If you say,
"How dare you?" you're expressing outrage or indignation.

1 Life tends to reward those who dare, and punish those who fear.
* lump :eww:
[2019-04-16 Tue 08:39]

If it's hard to determine its shape and otherwise looks like a big
blob of something, it's probably safe to call it a lump.

Jabba the Hut looks like a disgusting lump. So does the growing mound
on your noggin where you walked into the glass door. And if you've
been lumped together with a bad bunch, you might have been grouped
with people indiscriminately. But all lumps aren't bad. Little old
ladies put lumps of sugar into their tea. And that choked up feeling
you get during a sappy movie? That's just a lump in your throat.

5 Don’t start a business because others are doing it or because you’ve just
  come across a lump sum.
* deterred :eww:
[2019-04-16 Tue 08:51]

Deter means to discourage, or literally “to frighten away.” Halloween
decorations that are too scary might deter trick-or-treaters, and the
risk of being expelled deters kids from cheating in school.

Deter comes from the Latin de meaning "away" and terrere meaning
"frighten." Something that deters isn’t always scary, though:
citronella plants deter mosquitoes, and fines deter people from
littering. Teddy Roosevelt's foreign policy dictum "speak softly and
carry a big stick" was meant to deter other countries from attacking
the United States.

20 Never be deterred by other peoples opinions of your abilities.
* blessing :eww:
[2019-04-16 Tue 08:53]

A blessing is a prayer asking for God's protection, or a little gift
from the heavens. It's also any act of approving, like when your
roommate wants to move out and you give her your blessings.

Blessings have to do with approval. The first meaning is asking God
for protection or favor. Priests and ministers say blessings in
church, and some families say a blessing before dinner. Outside a
religious context, blessings are less formal. "I give you my blessing"
simply means "It's OK with me." People give their blessings to ideas
and actions when they agree with them. Giving a blessing is often the
same as giving permission.

26 Every failure is a blessing in disguise.
* strike :eww:
[2019-04-16 Tue 09:27]

At its most basic, strike means to hit. If you strike someone, you hit
them with your hand or a weapon. If lightning strikes, it makes
contact. If you strike out on a trip, you're "hitting" the road. If
you strike gold, you've "struck it rich"!

Strike can also mean not to hit, as in miss –– as in "three strikes
and you're out." That meaning might have evolved from strike meaning
to cross off, as in "If you don't come to practice, coach will strike
your name from the starting lineup." It might also have led to the
idea of a labor strike. If employees want to protest their work
conditions, they go on strike, or refuse to work until conditions
improve.

and strike oil.”
* slid :eww:
[2019-04-16 Tue 09:33]

To slide is to move down or across something in a smooth way. If
you’re into that kind of thing, head to a playground and go down a
slide. Just don’t push any toddlers out of the way.

You can slide your bed across your room so it's near the window, or
slide on the kitchen floor in your socks. You can also slide down a
slide, a play structure that's designed for climbing up and sliding
down. Another kind of slide is the small rectangular piece of glass
that scientists slide under a microscope to examine specimens, or the
photography slide you slide into a projector for viewing.

As detailed in this account of the Angola Train Horror the car slid
down into a gorge catching fire along the way and killing 49
passengers in the process.
* gorge :eww:
[2019-04-16 Tue 09:33]

A gorge is a very deep crevice between two mountains or hills. Gorges
are formed by rivers running through and eroding rock over a very long
period of time.

The Latin root of gorge means "throat," leading to both the "narrow
passage" meaning and the French gorgier, "to swallow," which
influenced the verb version of gorge, "to overeat." You may love to
gorge on ice cream, but the stomachache afterward won't be very
pleasant. To remember the "canyon" meaning, think of the famous
upstate New York bumper sticker, “Ithaca is gorges.” It's a play on
gorgeous, meaning beautiful, and the beautiful ravines in the area.

As detailed in this account of the Angola Train Horror the car slid
down into a gorge catching fire along the way and killing 49
passengers in the process.
* graft :eww:
[2019-04-16 Tue 09:35]

Graft can mean bribery or corruption. It's also a way of transplanting
skin or bones in medicine, as in a skin graft.

People who get terrible burns on their faces often have pieces of skin
taken from other parts of their bodies to help them heal and look
better. That transplanted skin is called a graft. There are also
grafts in agriculture, when farmers take a branch from one tree and
graft it onto another tree. The most common use of graft is in
political corruption cases when politicians are accused of taking
money in exchange for granting favors.

“EVERYBODY is talkin’ these days about Tammany men growin’ rich on
graft, but nobody thinks of drawin’ the distinction between honest
graft and dishonest graft….

* ruffling :eww:
[2019-04-27 Sat 09:25]

A ruffle a pleated piece of decorative fabric often used as trim on
clothes, like the ruffles on a pirate’s shirt. To ruffle is to make
someone lose their composure. Argh.

The word ruffle is mysterious, but it might be from the Low German
word ruffelen which means "to wrinkle." A ruffle on the bottom of a
dress is like a fancy wrinkle. To ruffle someone is to upset them, and
they’ll need to get straightened out. Often, this word is used in the
expression "ruffle their feathers." Hearing bad news will ruffle most
people's feathers. An unruffled person and an unruffled shirt will
both be smoother.

Then after
sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the
shadows rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling
and blinking from the old hollow tree.
* slumbers :eww:
[2019-04-27 Sat 09:27]

Slumber means "sleep" — as a verb or noun. If you're a sound sleeper,
you might slumber peacefully right through a thunderstorm, your
slumber undisturbed.

To slumber is to sleep, sometimes specifically to sleep lightly or
doze. You can slumber in your bed, in your airplane seat, or through
your alarm in the morning. Slumber can also describe a peacefulness,
like your quiet street that seems to slumber early in the morning. The
phrase slumber party was first used in the 1940s to mean a gathering
held at night, that usually involves very little slumbering.

Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to
please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily
slumbers.
* raspy :eww:
[2019-04-27 Sat 09:28]

A sound is raspy when it is rough or scratchy. If you get a bad cold
or scream encouragement to a losing team for a few hours, you will end
up with a raspy voice.

A rasp is a tool, usually used by wood- or metal-workers, to scrape.
Nail files and kitchen graters do the same work that a rasp does. A
raspy voice sounds like it had to pass through a rasp or a grater to
get out of your mouth. If you can barely speak, you might ask for
water in a raspy whisper. Other sounds can seem raspy too like a dry
cough, the caw of a crow or the bark of a dog that has been at it for
a long time.

One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in
the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy
song.
* den :eww:
[2019-04-27 Sat 09:32]

Where’s the one place that bears go to hibernate and you go to watch
the big game? It’s the den, a secluded room or shelter.

Den is an Old English word meaning “shelter for a wild animal.” While
we still use it in this sense, the word has taken on some additional
meanings. For example, den can refer to a room that's used primarily
for relaxing, watching television, and socializing with friends. (If
your friends tend to act wild at times, then perhaps this definition
isn’t so far off from the original one.) Den can also mean "a hideout
for criminals."

Up he jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as he was near enough so
the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him
up.
* pounced :eww:
[2019-04-27 Sat 09:33]

To pounce is to attack suddenly by leaping onto your prey. A tiger
will slowly sneak up on its prey and then suddenly pounce, using speed
as much as strength to make the kill.

Of all the animals, cats are the best at pouncing. Snakes strike.
Elephants charge. But when an animal leaps onto its prey, that's
pouncing. When we talk about how people pounce, however, we're usually
talking more figuratively. When we say that a person pounced on
another person, we mean that they attacked viciously without warning —
usually giving the victim no time to defend themselves. Lawyers pounce
on witnesses, for example. If you feel suddenly ganged-up on, you
might feel pounced upon.

Up he jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as he was near enough so
the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him
up.
* slender :eww:
[2019-04-27 Sat 09:38]

Something slender is slight, or skinny. A young colt is slender
compared to the full grown horse it will grow into.

Slender can be used in both positive and negative ways. If someone
tells you you have a slender figure, you'll probably be happy, unless
you're going for muscle-mass. A slender portion of potatoes will not
cheer a hungry growing boy. If you don't know much about something,
you can say your knowledge of it is slender. And if you become an
artist, get used to living on a slender budget. Now that's a nice way
to put it.

A Giant Oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender Reeds.
* tempest :eww:
[2019-04-27 Sat 09:39]

Shakespeare's The Tempest begins with one –– a tempest, or a violent
and windy storm.

The meaning of tempest has expanded over time to include the idea of
anger or fighting. A "tempest in a tea pot" means a passionate fight
over something that is in fact fairly trivial. For example, a
passionate discussion about whether to use cloth or paper napkins at
Thanksgiving could be considered a "tempest in a tea pot" to some.

"The slightest breeze that
ruffles the surface of the water makes you bow your heads, while I, the
mighty Oak, stand upright and firm before the howling tempest."
* folly :eww:
[2019-04-27 Sat 09:40]

Folly is a noun that means "foolish or crazy behavior." It would be
folly to spend all night playing video games when you have a difficult
exam the next day.

Folly comes from the Old French word folie meaning "madness,
stupidity." It can describe the silly or nonsensical things you do,
like the folly of trying to rush across town in the middle of a
snowstorm. Or it can describe the trait that makes people act that
way: the folly of an inexperienced driver who doesn't know you can't
speed on snow-covered roads. Can you see the word fool in folly? Not a
coincidence.

Better to yield when it is folly to resist, than to resist stubbornly
and be destroyed.
* brook :eww:
[2019-04-27 Sat 09:42]

A brook is a small stream. On a hot day, you might enjoy wading in a
babbling brook. As a verb, brook is a rather stuffy word for "put up
with." The lord of the manor might say, "I will brook no trespassing
on my land."

Brook is tailor-made for talking about what you won't stand for—it's
always "brook no..." If you brook no criticism of your friend, it
means you won't let people speak ill of her. If you brook no brooks,
it means you've developed a bizarre stream-hating fetish and will
spend the rest of your days trying to stop their flow.

A Giant Oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender Reeds.
* yield :eww:
[2019-04-27 Sat 10:02]

Yield has two meanings that seem quite different: "an amount" or "to
give way." The yield of the recipe was twelve brownies. To avoid being
tripped, Mary was forced to yield to the children on her way to the
brownie plate.

While these meanings seem quite different, they both essentially mean
"to give." The recipe gives twelve brownies to those who follow it,
and Mary is giving up her right to go first. Yield can also mean the
rate of return on an investment. A bond yields an interest rate of 2%,
or gives an investor $2.00 for every $100 invested.

Better to yield when it is folly to resist, than to resist stubbornly
and be destroyed.

* bogus :eww:
[2019-04-27 Sat 13:10]

Bogus means fake. A bogus dollar bill is counterfeit, a bogus Picasso
was not painted by him, and a bogus attempt at reconciliation would
come from someone who never intended to end a fight.

Perhaps appropriately, the word bogus originated in the US. Coined as
a name for a machine that printed counterfeit money, it later became a
trademark term among California surfers. In surfer speak, "totally
bogus, dude" would describe any unfortunate situation.

Presumably, people aren’t using a bogus
dog-age calculator to make medical decisions for their pets, and
veterinarians know better.
* involuntarily :Duke:
[2019-04-27 Sat 13:12]

When you do something involuntarily, you do it despite not wanting to.
You might involuntarily start to giggle during your cousin's Star
Wars-themed wedding ceremony.

Use the adverb involuntarily to describe things that are done against
your will or without your control. You'll involuntarily take a swim if
your brother pushes you in the deep end of a pool; when you have a
twitch in your eye, you blink involuntarily. In either case, the word
involuntarily combines the Latin prefix in, "not or opposite of" with
voluntarius, "of one's free will."

(3) Immigrants
didn’t have their names Americanized, involuntarily or otherwise, at
Ellis Island.)
* inveterate :Duke:
[2019-04-27 Sat 13:12]

If you're an inveterate doodler, all your notebooks are covered with
drawings. If you're an inveterate golf player, you probably get
twitchy if you haven't been out on a course in a week.

In Middle English inveterate was associated with chronic disease. Now
it simply refers to something that is a signature habit with a person.
Unless you're an inveterate gambler, drinker or smoker––in which case
you're addicted and we're back to talking about being sick.

And, as
Gilbert pointed out, “nature does not start from scratch; rather, she
is an inveterate jury rigger who rarely invents a new mechanism to do
splendidly what an old mechanism can be modified to do tolerably
well.”
* goofy :Duke:
[2019-04-27 Sat 13:13]

Anything goofy is ridiculous and cute, like a squirrel on a skateboard
or a big football player snuggling a teddy bear after every touch
down. Goofy things are often well-intentioned but weird.

Being awkward, telling dumb jokes and stories, or wearing crazy
clothes are all great ways to be goofy. A goofy smile is sweet, unless
you’re in England where it means you have big crooked teeth. Goofy,
the dopey Disney dog who is all of these things, was created in 1929
when the word was brand new. It comes from a variation on the English
dialect goff, "foolish clown."

That should be proof enough that the way
we form beliefs is pretty goofy.
* credulous :Duke:
[2019-04-27 Sat 13:14]

People who believe things easily without having to be convinced are
credulous. Sales people are always hoping that someone credulous picks
up the phone during a sales call.

Credulous comes from the 16th-century Latin credulus, or "easily
believes." A synonym for credulous is gullible, and both terms
describe a person who accepts something willingly without a lot of
supporting facts. Calling someone credulous can imply that the person
is naive and simple. An individual isn't necessarily insulted by being
called credulous, though, because some objects of belief, like
religions and unicorns, come with a willing leap of faith for
believing in what is unseen.

In a 1991 paper in which he summarized centuries of
philosophical and scientific study on the subject, he concluded,
“Findings from a multitude of research literatures converge on a
single point: People are credulous creatures who find it very easy to
believe and very difficult to doubt.
* haphazard :Duke:
[2019-04-27 Sat 13:15]

Anything haphazard is random, disorganized, slipshod, or hit-or-miss.
A tent erected haphazardly might look more like a big nylon bag of
dirty laundry than a place to sleep.

Ever heard the expression "I'll hazard a guess?" In it, the word
hazard means "chance," as in "take a chance." Think of the hap in
haphazard as short for "happen." Combine hap- and -hazard and you get
something that happens (or appears to have happened) by chance. If you
approach a math problem with haphazard reasoning, you're likely to get
it wrong.

We form beliefs in a haphazard way, believing all sorts of things
based just on what we hear out in the world but haven’t researched for
ourselves.
* impending :Duke:
[2019-04-27 Sat 13:16]

If something is impending, it is about to happen. If you hear thunder
in the distance, you might go inside to escape the impending storm.

The word impending often refers to something threatening or
frightening: impending doom, impending disaster. Something that is
impending hangs over you — you might say, "I was so distracted by
thoughts of my impending failure in my exams, I couldn't study." A
synonym is imminent.

[S]cientists say baldness
anywhere in your family may be a sign of your own impending fate.”
* negligence :Duke:
[2019-04-27 Sat 13:25]

When you are careless or reckless and you don’t take care of a person,
object or situation like you ought to, you are practicing negligence.
"Her negligence of the house resulted in its being condemned by the
city."

The noun negligence comes from a Latin word that means “carelessness.”
Negligence can come in many forms: negligence of one's children can
lead to foster care, negligence while driving can cause fatal
accidents, negligence of work can lead to the loss of a job, and
negligence of nutrition can cause health problems. There is
culpability in negligence. Negligence is when one neglects to do
things that should be done, and there are usually consequences.

When, five
messages later, subjects received a correction that the closet was
empty, they still answered questions about the fire by blaming burning
paint for toxic fumes and citing negligence for keeping flammable
objects nearby.
* spell :eww:
[2019-04-29 Mon 09:50]

A spell is a series of words that has magical powers. If you’re under
a spell, then what you do is out of your control — your thoughts and
actions are dictated by the spell.

Spell can refer to the magic words you say, or it can describe being
under the influence of those words. You probably don’t encounter many
magic spells in real life, but the word is often used figuratively to
describe those times when you feel like a magical power controls your
action. Of course, this word can also mean the verb "to spell" which
refers to reciting the letters in a word, like the competitive
spellers in a spelling bee.

In a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to
drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it.
* pitcher :eww:
[2019-04-29 Mon 09:50]

In baseball or softball, the pitcher is the player who throws the ball
to the catcher in an attempt to strike out the batter. Another kind of
pitcher is one that holds a liquid, like a pitcher of lemonade.

The pitcher is one of the most important players on a team, aiming the
pitch so that it stays inside a certain "strike zone," but in a way
that entices the batter to swing and miss or not to swing at all. The
batter, on the other hand, tries to hit the ball that the pitcher
throws, and maybe even to hit a home run. The 18th-century meaning of
pitcher was "one who pitches hay into a wagon."

In a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to
drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it.
* chasm :eww:
[2019-04-29 Mon 09:54]

A chasm is a deep divide, either literal or figurative, such as a
giant chasm in an ice cap or the growing chasm between two friends who
haven't spoken in a long time.

The first syllable in chasm sounds like cat without the t sound:
"CA-zum." It comes from the Greek word khasma, meaning "yawning
hollow, gulf" and was originally used to describe a split in a land
formation, such as a deep crack caused by an earthquake. The word
still retains that sense, but today can also mean "a profound division
between people or beliefs," such as a chasm between Republicans and
Democrats.

Two Goats, frisking gayly on the rocky steeps of a mountain valley,
chanced to meet, one on each side of a deep chasm through which poured a
mighty mountain torrent.
* tremble :eww:
[2019-04-29 Mon 09:55]

To tremble is to quiver or shake without meaning to. Your hands
probably tremble when you're nervous.

Trembling is a movement, but it's not one that anyone intends to make.
Someone who is extremely scared or cold might tremble all over. Older
people tend to tremble more often than younger people, sometimes
because of serious disorders like Parkinson's disease. The root word
of tremble is the Latin tremulus, "trembling or tremulous." Certain
honey bees perform a wiggly, shivering movement called a "tremble
dance," which scientists believe inspires speedier nectar collection.

The narrow path would have made the
bravest tremble.
* stump :eww:
[2019-04-29 Mon 10:00]

There are three ways to stump: you can ask someone a question they
can't answer, you can travel making political speeches, or you can
stomp.

Stump can mean many things as a verb. The most common use is when
someone — like a teacher — asks a question that no one can answer.
That's a case of the teacher stumping the class. Also, politicians
traveling through a district, making speeches are stumping, giving
what are called stump speeches. Once in a while, to stump means the
same thing as two similar words, stomp and stamp. If you're stumping,
stomping, and stamping around, you're making a lot of noise with your
feet.

A Wild Boar was sharpening his tusks busily against the stump of a tree,
when a Fox happened by.
* affection :eww:
[2019-04-29 Mon 10:17]

Affection is the positive feeling you may have or express for other
people or things. Your grandma may show her affection for you by
pinching your cheek, and you may show your affection for your dog by
rubbing her belly.

Not everybody is good at showing affection to their loved ones, like
old-school dads or tough guys in action movies. If people don't get
enough affection, they crave it, and will go to great lengths to get
it. You might say that affection is what Luke wanted from Darth Vader
all along, in Star Wars.

* tithe :eww:
[2019-04-29 Mon 10:26]

To tithe is to make a contribution equal to one-tenth of your income,
usually to a church or religious institution. Devout church-goers
usually tithe, even in years when their finances are very tight.

Tithe comes from the Old English word teogotha, which means “tenth.”
To tithe is to relinquish one-tenth of your personal income, either as
a mandatory contribution, a voluntary donation, or as a levy. In
ancient times farmers were required to tithe a portion of their crops.
You may suspect that some of the wealthiest members of your church
don’t really tithe as expected.

That’s why we pay tithe.

* verge :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 16:00]

Think of an edge, a border, a boundary, and you are thinking about the
verge, the point where something begins or ends.

We talk about a nervous person being on the verge of a breakdown, or
about a scientist being on the verge of a major breakthrough, but the
British have another good physical meaning: they call the strip of
grass that borders a walkway the verge, giving you a clear mental
picture that goes beyond the abstract.

* instilled :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 16:07]

Parents work hard to develop, or instill, positive beliefs and values
in their children. Interestingly, there's no corresponding word for
when parents pass down their bad habits.

Instill comes from the Latin verb stillare, meaning "to drip." For
some people, this word provides an apt metaphor for the way that
parents and teachers cultivate understanding in young learners,
patiently introducing wisdom "drop by drop." (Of course, for others,
instill conjures up the image of a persistently dripping faucet that
just won't be quiet.)

* flagrant :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 16:09]

Something flagrant is bad — so bad you can't ignore it. A flagrant
foul in sports might send you to the bench, and a flagrant violation
of the law might send you to the slammer.

The current meaning of the adjective flagrant — "obviously offensive
or disgraceful" — is thought to derive from the Latin legal term in
flagrante delicto, which literally meant "with fire still blazing" and
is used figuratively to describe a situation in which the criminal is
caught red handed. Aside from a flagrant abuse of the law, the word
can also be used to describe anything that is obviously bad — like
flagrant bad taste or flagrant abuse of the rules of grammar.

Princeton students saw Dartmouth commit twice as
many flagrant penalties and three times the mild penalties
as Princeton.
* infractions :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 16:10]

When you break school rules about gum chewing, you commit an
infraction. An infraction is a petty crime or a minor breaking of
rules.

When you think of the word infraction, think that your offence has
just crossed the line into wrong. Something like a parking ticket is
an infraction. When you commit an infraction, you're not knee deep in
wrong, you've just dipped your toe into wrong to see what it feels
like. A misdemeanor is a more serious crime such as theft, and murder
is considered a felony, the most serious of crimes.

Dartmouth students saw each team commit an
equal number of infractions.
* homage :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 16:12]

Homage means great respect and honor, or something done to honor a
person or thing. We pay homage to our ancestors and say prayers in
homage to their memory.

In Middle English, homage specifically referred to respect for and
loyalty to a feudal lord. The word was borrowed from Old French,
probably from omne, homme "man," from Latin homō. The noun suffix –age
is used to mean "an action, process, result, or state."

A study in the 2012 Stanford Law Review called “They Saw a
Protest” (the title is a homage to the original Hastorf
and Cantril experiment) by Yale professor of law and
psychology Dan Kahan, a leading researcher and analyst of
biased reasoning, and four colleagues reinforces this
notion that our beliefs drive the way we process
information.
* congruence :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 16:15]

Congruence means compatibility. If you've been studying French, you
might be glad to note, when learning Spanish, that there are many
areas of congruence in grammar and vocabulary between the two Romance
languages.

In geometry, shapes are congruent when they are exactly the same, such
as squares with three-inch sides. In a more general context, congruent
means "in agreement with," as in "the school's rules are congruent
with expectations for behavior at home."

But what they saw—earnest voicing of dissent
intended only to persuade, or physical intimidation
calculated to interfere with the freedom of
others—depended on the congruence of the protestors’
positions with the subjects’ own cultural values.”
* lodged :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 18:43]

A lodge is an inn where travelers stay overnight. If you’re in need of
a night’s sleep while traveling an out of the way country road, you’re
more likely to find yourself at a lodge than a fancy or chain hotel.

A lodge can also be a cabin in the woods; like an inn, it’s usually a
temporary accommodation. But if you join your local lodge, you’ll be
expected to be a regular visitor, at least at the monthly the
meetings. Lodge is also a verb, meaning to stay temporarily, or to
give someone a place to stay. If you lodge a toothpick between your
teeth, though, you’ll probably hope it won’t stay there too long.

Once a belief is lodged, it becomes difficult
to dislodge.
* embellished :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 18:47]

The word "bell" shows up in the middle of embellish, and bells are
something that decorate, or embellish something, making it more
attractive. If you embellish speech, though, it can get ugly if you
add a lot of details that aren't true.

Embellish often has the positive meaning of adding something to make
it more handsome or beautifully decorated. But, while adding bells to
something looks great at first, after a couple of hours of bells
ringing in the ears, what was meant to embellish and beautify can get
annoying. That's what can happen when you embellish by adding too many
false or exaggerated details to a story. Embellishing with true,
colorful details and vivid descriptions is what can really enhance the
beauty of a story.

Disinformation is different than fake news in that the
story has some true elements, embellished to spin a
particular narrative.
* swat :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 18:55]

To swat is to hit or bat at something. You might try to swat a fly
with a rolled-up magazine and then watch your cat swat at it with her
paws.

Someone who's attacked by a swarm of wasps will swat at them as they
run away, and a kid who's annoyed at her sister might swat her, too.
The smack itself is also called a swat. Experts suspect that swat is
an alteration of the Middle English swap, "to strike," which mimics
the sound of a sharp blow.

We’ll work hard to swat that threat away.
* attenuate :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 19:00]

Attenuate is a verb that means to make or become weaker. The effects
of aging may be attenuated by exercise (or by drinking from the
fountain of youth).

The versatile word attenuate denotes a weakening in amount, intensity,
or value. As a verb, attenuate is usually transitive, meaning it needs
an object to be complete, such as in the sentence: "This tanning
process tends to attenuate the deer hide, making it softer." The word
can be intransitive in past tense, as in "The rain attenuated, ending
the storm." And it can even be used as an adjective to describe
something weakened: "Even an attenuated solution will remove the
stain."

The
researchers tested subjects for seven cognitive biases and
found that cognitive ability did not attenuate the blind
spot.
* abate :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 19:05]

Something that abates becomes fewer or less intense. Your enthusiasm
for skiing might abate after falling off a ski lift and getting a
mouthful of snow.

Abate comes from the Old French verb abattre, "to beat down," and
means to reduce or become less intense or numerous. As an intransitive
verb, it is often used with something physically, emotionally, or
figuratively violent, as in "the flood of fan mail began to abate."
Using it transitively, if you take measures to abate pollution or
noise, you reduce them. Pronounce abate with the stress on the second
syllable (uh-BATE).

does not abate among
high-Numeracy subjects.
* refrain :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 21:34]

When someone burps in a quiet classroom it can be hard to refrain from
laughing. Use the verb refrain if you have a sudden impulse to do
something, and you have stopped yourself from doing it.

It's usually hard to refrain from doing something, because this word
is used to describe habits, like smoking, or uncontrollable urges,
like laughing. The Latin word refrēnāre is formed from the prefix re-
"back" plus frēnāre "to hold a horse back with a bridle." There is a
noun refrain, but that's a different and unrelated word.

This is one of those instances where being
smart and aware of our capacity for irrationality alone
doesn’t help us refrain from biased reasoning.

They are
just making a point—a valid point that perhaps we
overstated our conclusion or made our statement without
including relevant caveats.
* temper :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 21:43]

Temper can refer to a tendency to become unreasonably angry. If you’re
not sure whether you have a temper, ask your friends — but don’t get
mad if you dislike what they have to say.

Temper has a number of related yet distinct meanings. In addition to
describing a tendency to anger, temper can also refer to one’s mood in
general; if you use the word in this sense, you might describe
someone's temper as "angry" or "mild." Temper can also be used as a
verb meaning “to restrain.” If you have a nasty temper, you might try
tempering your temper by counting to ten whenever you’re tempted to
throw a "temper tantrum," or fit.

The more we recognize that we are betting on
our beliefs (with our happiness, attention, health, money,
time, or some other limited resource), the more we are
likely to temper our statements, getting closer to the
truth as we acknowledge the risk inherent in what we
believe.
* gauntlet :Duke:
[2019-05-09 Thu 21:44]

A gauntlet is a glove covered in steel that was worn in suits of
armor, but it also means punishment or, when "throwing down the
gauntlet," a challenge.

Gauntlet comes from the Old French word for "glove," which was thrown
down as a symbol of a challenge. “Running the gauntlet” is an old
military form of punishment in which the victim runs between two rows
of men wearing armored gloves, who beat him as he passes through the
lines. Today, if someone makes you run the gauntlet, they won’t really
strike you with armored gloves, but they'll probably make you do
something miserable.

Expecting everyone starting to throw the gauntlet down,
challenging each other to bet on any opinion, is
impractical if you aren’t hanging out in a poker room.
