If you're irascible, you get angry easily — perhaps blowing up in rage
when someone brushes into you.

Irascible comes from the Latin root ira, which means "anger" or
"rage," the same root that gives us the word ire, "anger." The -sc in
the middle of irascible, means "becoming," so irascible doesn't just
mean you're angry — it's got action built into it. If you're looking
for a fight most of the time, then you're irascible — ready for the
spark that's going to set you on fire.

He begins to get more irascible and one day while his wife is out
he decides that he's going to collect all his childhood mementos the
memories of his youth and burn them as if he's trying to eradicate his
past.
