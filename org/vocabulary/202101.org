Think of an edge, a border, a boundary, and you are thinking about the
verge, the point where something begins or ends.

We talk about a nervous person being on the verge of a breakdown, or
about a scientist being on the verge of a major breakthrough, but the
British have another good physical meaning: they call the strip of
grass that borders a walkway the verge, giving you a clear mental
picture that goes beyond the abstract.

Six short months before I read Chadâ€™s book, I was on the verge of
changing careers.
