* awareness :satellite:
[2018-10-02 Tue 09:33]

Awareness is the state of knowing something, such as the awareness
that the sun comes up every morning.

The adjective aware gets turned into a noun when the suffix -ness is
added, so awareness is the state of being aware, or having knowledge
of something. Its roots are Germanic, and come from the Old English
wær meaning "wary, cautious." Awareness can be something you notice,
want to tell others about, or already know. You could "raise
awareness" of a cause, like fighting breast cancer. Yet, your
awareness of the baby sleeping next door might prevent you from having
band practice in the garage. Smart move.

Personal development covers activities that improve awareness and
identity, develop talents and potential, build human capital and
facilitate employability, enhance the quality of life and contribute to
the realization of dreams and aspirations.
* aspirations :satellite:
[2018-10-02 Tue 09:34]

If your aspiration, or ambition, is to climb Mt. Everest someday, you
better start training, because it’s a long, hard climb that requires a
lot of preparation.

Aspiration means "inhalation" or "breathing." So how did it come to
mean "ambition" or "the will to succeed"? The Latin gives us a clue:
spirare ("to breathe") and spiritus ("spirit"). It was once believed
that our breath was our soul or spirit, which might explain why we
talk about "breathing life into" something, or coming up with energy
and ideas to invigorate it. How else to breathe life into something
than with ambition and drive, in other words, "spirit"?

Personal development covers activities that improve awareness and
identity, develop talents and potential, build human capital and
facilitate employability, enhance the quality of life and contribute to
the realization of dreams and aspirations.
* prevalence :satellite:
[2018-10-02 Tue 09:39]

Prevalence means there is a lot of something. If you get a bad grade
on a paper for having a prevalence of typos, you need to proofread
your work more carefully.

The word prevalence comes from the Latin praevalere, meaning
"condition of being widespread or general." The word is often used to
describe a phenomenon that is widespread in a community, like the
prevalence of a disease across a country. Prevalence is another word
for "commonness." If there's a prevalence of thefts in your
neighborhood, that means the likelihood of your house getting robbed
is pretty high.

However, there are two
newer ways increasing in prevalence: consumer-to-business and
consumer-to-consumer.
* astray :Covey:
[2018-10-11 Thu 16:32]

If you go astray, you lose the path. If you went to college intending
to become a doctor, but instead became interested in making violent
video games, your parents might feel you have gone astray.

A stray animal is one that has gotten loose, and the adverb astray
comes from this sense of wandering off from the proper place, even
though it's not just for animals. If you go astray, you lose the right
way, or are out of place. It can be a moral judgment: juvenile
delinquents are kids who have gone astray. But it can also refer to
small details. If you dress impeccably, you make sure that no thread
is astray.

Something or someone described as [errant] has gone astray or done
  wrong by going in an unexpected direction.
* piecemeal :Covey:
[2018-10-17 Wed 16:54]

When you do something piecemeal, you're doing it little by little, but
in a seemingly random way, with no order or system.

Say you're a computer geek and someone calls you desperate to find out
how to fix a computer that's just crashed. If you respond piecemeal to
the caller's questions, she'll have to call you back many times to get
all the information she needs to get the computer up again. You may
like to talk to her, but she's not going to be impressed with your
computer smarts.

The Seven Habits are not a set of separate or piecemeal psych-up formulas.
* smack :Covey:
[2018-10-17 Wed 17:00]

A smack is a slap or blow made with the palm of a hand or something
else that's flat. Instead of giving your dog a smack for chasing the
cat, you should speak calmly and firmly to him.

Smack also describes the sound of a smack, like when your Frisbee hits
your neighbor's house with a smack. It's a verb too: "I'm tempted to
smack you for saying that about my brother." Sometimes, smack takes
the form of a descriptive adverb: "I ran smack into the mailbox while
I was texting and walking." Informally, a smack can also be a kiss, or
an eager movement of the lips in anticipation of something delicious.

The little understood concept of interdependence appears to many to smack
of dependence, and therefore, we find people, often for selfish reasons,
leaving their marriages, abandoning their children, and forsaking all kinds
of social responsibility—all in the name of independence.
* impatience :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:04]

Impatience is the tendency to be irritable or easily frustrated. A bus
driver's impatience often results in her yelling, honking her horn,
and gesturing angrily at other drivers.

If you are easily annoyed or provoked, your impatience is showing.
Impatience is also why you hate being late, or having to wait for
something or someone. It comes from patience, the habit or trait of
being able to wait calmly or even tolerate discomfort without
complaining. The "opposite of" prefix im- tells you that impatience is
the complete opposite.

But with his increasing wealth comes greed and impatience.
* appraised :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:04]

When you buy a house someone will need to appraise its value before
you can get a mortgage. To appraise something is to figure out its
worth in the marketplace, on the field, or in the world of ideas.

To appraise the value of a friendship is difficult, but to appraise
the value of your grandfather’s pocket watch — just go to the pawn
shop. The verb appraise comes from the Late Latin word appretiare,
which means “value” or “estimate.” You can appraise your chances of
marrying royalty, which are probably slim. You can also appraise the
value of a quarterback on your fantasy football team by looking at the
statistics for his completed passes.

But as he starts to throw the egg aside, he has second
thoughts and takes it in to be appraised instead.
* wherewithal :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:06]

If you have the wherewithal to do something, it means you've got what
you need to make it happen.

Another word for wherewithal is resources, which can mean money,
energy, support, or some other necessary means. If you have the
wherewithal to build a new house, it can mean you have the knowledge
and patience to do it yourself, or that you've got the money to pay
someone to build it for you. The word combines where and withal — a
now-obscure word that means "in addition." Don't forget to spell it
with only one l.

On the
other hand, if you only take care of the goose with no aim toward the
golden eggs, you soon won’t have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the
goose.

A few years ago, I purchased a physical asset—a power lawnmower.
* tremendous :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:09]

Tremendous means extraordinarily large in size, extent, amount, power,
or degree. It can also mean really marvelous and fantastic — or really
awful and terrible.

We often use tremendous if something is super wonderful. If someone
comes into your office and tells you you just won a big contract and
are getting a huge bonus, you might exclaim, “Tremendous!” Tremendous
comes from the Latin for "trembling," and is connected with fear.
Something tremendous can be big in a terrifying way, like the
tremendous noise of an approaching hurricane, or a tremendous tidal
wave about to crash on the shore.

Keeping P and PC in balance makes a tremendous difference in
the effective use of physical assets.

And the dwindling capital becomes smaller and smaller until it no longer
supplies even basic needs.
* kindnesses :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:14]

If someone asks you to do them a kindness, they mean a nice, kind act,
the kind that makes you think of puppies and daisies.

The noun kindness can be used for a kind act or to describe someone's
temperament. You might say of someone that her kindness is quite
genuine, or on the other hand she fakes kindness to get what she
wants.

When two people in a marriage are more concerned about getting the golden
eggs, the benefits, than they are in preserving the relationship that makes
them possible, they often become insensitive and inconsiderate, neglecting
the little kindnesses and courtesies so important to a deep relationship.
* courtesies :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:14]

A courtesy is a polite remark or respectful act. Complain about a bad
meal, and you might get kicked out. But the common courtesy is usually
an apology from the manager and, if you're lucky, a free dinner.

Courtesy is all about using your good manners, which is why it shares
roots with the word courteous. Holding the door open for someone,
writing a thank-you note for a gift, and letting the pregnant lady
have the last seat on the bus are all courtesies that would make your
parents proud. And if something is kindly presented to you free of
charge, the gift-giver may say it's "courtesy of" someone special.

When two people in a marriage are more concerned about getting the golden
eggs, the benefits, than they are in preserving the relationship that makes
them possible, they often become insensitive and inconsiderate, neglecting
the little kindnesses and courtesies so important to a deep relationship.
* permissive :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:15]

Being permissive is the opposite of being strict. Permissive parents
let their kids stay up later and have more sweets.

A permissive person is a little more lenient or loosey-goosey with the
rules. A permissive teacher is easier on the students and lets them
get away with more. A permissive coach will cut players slack during
practices and games. Laws can be permissive too — about drugs, guns,
and other things that could be tightly controlled. A permissive
society is one with more freedom. When a situation is permissive,
there's permission to do more things.

Either way—authoritarian or permissive—you have the golden egg mentality.
* undermine :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:18]

To undermine literally means to dig a hole underneath something,
making it likely to collapse. But we more often use the word to
describe sabotage or the act of weakening someone else's efforts.

Originally spelled with a ‘y’ instead of an ‘i’, undermine has
Germanic roots and means to weaken, hinder, or impair. Accidentally
undermine the foundation of a house by digging a tunnel to China
beneath it and you might be forgiven. Undermine your teacher’s
authority by speaking out of turn and throwing spitballs and odds are
you’ll get in trouble.

You might even escalate your
efforts to threatening or yelling, and in your desire to get the golden
egg, you undermine the health and welfare of the goose.
* serendipitous :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:21]

Serendipitous is an adjective that describes accidentally being in the
right place at the right time, like bumping into a good friend in some
unusual location, or finding a hundred dollar bill on the ground.

The root of serendipitous comes from the fairy tale "The Three Princes
of Serendip," in which three princes make one lucky and surprising
discovery after another. A serendipitous moment happens by accident,
usually when you’re doing something completely unrelated, like digging
a hole in your yard to bury your hamster and finding a treasure chest
of jewels. That’s a sad but serendipitous funeral.

That experience was not a planned P experience; it was the serendipitous
fruit of a PC investment.
* immensely :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:22]

Immensely is an adverb that means vastly, or very, or hugely. An
immensely good time is a really, really good time.

If you know that immense means huge, then you probably already have a
sense of what immensely means. It's a word for describing the enormous
degree of something. A New York Times bestseller is an immensely
popular book. Any offensive lineman is an immensely large human being.
The earth is immensely old. A mouse can't be described as doing
anything immensely, but an elephant does things immensely all the
time.

One of the immensely valuable aspects of any correct principle is that it
is valid and applicable in a wide variety of circumstances.
* clam :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:25]

A clam is a marine animal with two shells that eats by straining food
from water, sand, or mud. You can sometimes find clams by digging in
the sand close to the seashore.

The largest clams are used for food by humans, including the scallop,
a particularly big form of clam. When you order soup in New England,
it's not unlikely that it will be clam chowder, a creamy, thick stew
with potatoes and pieces of clam. When clam is a verb, it means "to
dig clams on the beach," and if your friend offers to pay you 1000
clams for your old car, she means "dollars."

I know of a restaurant that served a fantastic clam chowder and was packed
with customers every day at lunchtime.
* chowder :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:25]

Chowder is a thick, chunky soup that often contains fish or shellfish.
New England is well known for its creamy, rich version of clam
chowder.

Chowder is somewhere between a soup and a stew — it's full of chunks
of potato and onions, thick with bacon, fish, or vegetables, and
sometimes eaten with crackers on the side or crumbled on top. Chowder
is one of many words that distinctly originated in America, and it was
included in the first edition of Noah Webster's dictionary of American
English. Chowder comes from the pot in which it's cooked, chaudière,
French for "a pot."

I know of a restaurant that served a fantastic clam chowder and was packed
with customers every day at lunchtime.
* dwindled :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 13:26]

What do love, money, and the earth all have in common? All can
dwindle, or shrink away, if we don't handle them properly.

The word dwindle has a wonderfully descriptive, almost childlike sound
to it, as though it belongs in a nursery rhyme. That might help you
remember the meaning, which is to shrink away gradually, like the
Cheshire Cat in "Alice in Wonderland," who dwindles away until nothing
is left but his grin.

Trust was gone, and
business dwindled to almost nothing.
* misdeeds :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 17:43]

A misdeed is a type of bad behavior, especially behavior that's
immoral. If you get caught stealing someone’s lunch, you’ll be
punished for your misdeed.

A deed is an action, and a misdeed is a specific type of action. It’s
one that's wicked, unethical, illegal, or just plain wrong. It’s the
opposite of a good deed. Cheating on a test is a misdeed. So is
cheating on your spouse. Stealing is a misdeed, as is any other crime.
Politicians get caught in scandals when their misdeeds are discovered,
such as lying or taking bribes. It’s from the Old English misdæd for
"sin, evil.”

The word scapegoat first
  occurred in the earliest English translation of the Bible, and it has
  come to mean any individual punished for the misdeeds of others.
* evade :Covey:
[2018-10-19 Fri 17:50]

When you evade something, you escape it. You could evade a police
chase by slipping into a secret alley, or you could evade your
mother's questions about the missing cookies by slipping into another
topic.

Other things people like to evade? Death. Taxes. Creepy ex-boyfriends.
The verb evade comes from Latin roots ex ("away) and vadere ("to
walk"), meaning literally "to walk away or to escape." Definitely what
you want to do with creepy ex-boyfriends.

Master criminals
  rely on their ingenuity in order to evade the law when they are
  chased.
* abstain :Covey:
[2018-10-20 Sat 09:06]

If you abstain from something, you restrain yourself from consuming
it. People usually abstain from things that are considered vices —
like eating French fries every day for lunch.

Roots of the word abstain are from the 14th-century French, "to
withhold oneself," and the word often refers to people who hold
themselves back from indulging in habits that are bad for them,
physically or morally. Abstain can also mean to withhold a vote, and
sometimes a difficult decision is stalled when government
representatives abstain from voting one way or another.

deliberately avoid using; abstain from.
* condemns :Covey:
[2018-10-20 Sat 09:08]

You can condemn, or openly criticize, someone who is behaving
inappropriately. If you are an animal rights activist, you would
probably condemn someone for wearing fur.

Condemn originally comes, through Old French, from the Latin word
condemnāre, "to sentence, condemn." You may see politicians condemn
each other in political ads during a campaign in hopes of improving
their chances of winning an election. You also might hear of a convict
being "condemned to death." In this sense of the word, to condemn
still carries on its Latin meaning of "to sentence."

"Her status as slave condemns her to a life of servitude , with little or no control over her future."
* reel :Covey:
[2018-10-20 Sat 09:15]

A reel is a cylinder that can be wound with flexible material like
film or fishing line. If you found dozens of reels of old home movies
in your grandparents' attic, you'd search for a projector.

You might find an old movie reel, a reel of copper wire, or a fishing
reel. Use the reel on your fishing pole to reel in your fish! Yes,
it’s a verb, too. And it’s a lively folk dance — or the music for it —
from Scotland (Highland reel), or America (Virginia reel). As a verb,
reel also means to sway from dizziness. If an ear infection messes
with your balance, you might reel down the hall like you were drunk.

If they meander or try to postpone for a later undefined call, reel
  them in and get them to come to the point.
* wobbly :Covey:
[2018-10-20 Sat 14:01]

But everyone agrees on the current
  meaning: someone who falters is unsteady, wobbly, or unsure.
* Batch :Covey:
[2018-10-20 Sat 14:02]

A batch is a completed group, collection, or quantity of something,
especially something that's just been made. You might, for example,
bake a batch of cookies to take to your new neighbor.

A company that makes soap might deliver a batch, loaded on a truck, to
a new store in Vermont, and if you manage a bakery you might declare,
"That's it! This is our last batch of gingerbread until next year!" In
computer lingo, a batch is, similarly, a group or collection of
records. The Old English root, bæcce, means "something baked," from
bacan, "bake."

Time Consumers: Batch and Do Not Falter
