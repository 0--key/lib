   noun
   1. a person who commits [burglar]y. "A pioneering scheme to gate off
      alleys to [burglar]s and thieves could be on its way to parts of
      central York."

   Use the word [burglar] when you're talking about someone who steals
   things from inside a house or a building.

   A [burglar] often breaks a window or forces a lock, intending to take
   valuable items. The act of doing this is [burglar]y, and to do it is
   to [burglar]ize in the United States, or to burgle in Britain. In the
   1540's, [burglar] was a short form of the word burglator, from the
   Latin burgare, "to break open."

   About that time I invented a [burglar] alarm, which was a very
   simple-minded thing: it was just a big battery and a bell connected
   with some wire.

   adjective
   1. very great in amount, scale, or intensity. "Penny put in a
      [tremendous] amount of time"

   [Tremendous] means extraordinarily large in size, extent, amount,
   power, or degree. It can also mean really marvelous and fantastic —
   or really awful and terrible.

   We often use [tremendous] if something is super wonderful. If someone
   comes into your office and tells you you just won a big contract and
   are getting a huge bonus, you might exclaim, “[Tremendous]!”
   [Tremendous] comes from the Latin for "trembling," and is connected
   with fear. Something [tremendous] can be big in a terrifying way, like
   the [tremendous] noise of an approaching hurricane, or a [tremendous]
   tidal wave about to crash on the shore.

   1. [coax]ial. "[coax] connectors"

   When you [coax] someone, you try to convince him gently, with pleasant
   words and maybe a little flattery. You’ll have to be patient, as you
   can’t rush someone you’re trying to [coax].

   When you [coax], you have to be nice about it – you can’t threaten or
   force. You put on a little charm and gently urge, so that the person
   or thing is happy about being [coax]ed. You might [coax] the runaway
   elephant back into the zoo by patting her gently and talking into
   her ear. If you wake up with a terrible bedhead, you might [coax] your
   hair back into place with the help of a little hair gel and a comb.

   A reel is a cylinder that can be wound with flexible material like
   film or fishing line. If you found dozens of reels of old home
   movies in your grandparents' attic, you'd search for a projector.

   You might find an old movie reel, a reel of copper wire, or a

   In humans, our jaw is the bony part of the head that contains our

   anatomical meaning, you can use jaw as a verb to mean "chat." You
   might love to get together with your friends and jaw about

   "cheek or jaw."

   [Algae] is actually the plural form of the word alga, which in Latin

   a small pouch, one that’s typically filled with liquid. Unlike the
   bladder, however, a [cyst] is closed, meaning the liquid can’t get
   out. A [cyst] is often an abnormal formation in the body, so doctors

   1. a very small stream. "sweat ran in [rivulet]s down his back"

   A [rivulet] is a small stream. A [rivulet] is to a river as a baby is to
   an adult.

   There are several ways to remember this word. One is the similarity
   of its sound to "river." Another is the suffix -let, which indicates
   small things. For example, a piglet is a small pig or baby pig. A
   300-pound pig probably wouldn't drown in a tiny [rivulet], but a
   piglet should stay clear. Another word for [rivulet] is "streamlet."

   reduce to [rivulet]s of crimson.

   If you have a [keen] interest in something, you are really, really
   into it. [Keen] is an adjective that describes something that is
   intense, sharp, or focused.

   The adjective [keen] comes from the Old English word cene that
   translates to "bold and brave" and while the spelling is now really
   different, the sounds are similar. Variations of [keen] as being
   "bold" and "strong" show up in other languages like Old Norse,
   German, Dutch, but apparently only English has the meaning of
   "sharp" — relating to "an edge or blade." [Keen] has a lot of close —
   and brutal — synonyms, such as caustic, cutting, piercing, and
   penetrating!

   Snow algae have since drawn the attention of climate scientists and
   of biologists [keen] to understand the conditions under which life
   might develop on other planets.

   verb
   1. (of a man) consort with prostitutes.

   [Wench] used to mean young girl, so if you find someone describing a
   lovely [wench] in Shakespeare, it means a lovely girl.

   [Wench] comes from Middle English, and was a common word for girl,
   child, or servant. Over time it came to mean mainly serving girls,
   as in a bar [wench], who serves drinks at a tavern. Eventually it came
   to mean prostitute. If you find [wench] in a love poem from the 16th
   century, think of it as an informal version of maiden. But if
   someone called you a [wench] last week, you should be insulted.

   Children was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and trying to

   and a rounded frame laced with strings, and it's used to hit a ball.

   A [racket] is used to play tennis, badminton, or squash, and it can

   unpleasantly loud noise; if your neighbors were playing horrible,
   loud music, you could yell out the window, "Stop that [racket]!"
   Informally, the word [racket] also means "illegal scheme," especially

   hitting a ball with the hand.

   2. quickly or suddenly remove someone from a dangerous or unpleasant
      situation. "the baby was [pluck]ed from a grim foster home"
   3. sound (a musical instrument or its strings) with one's finger or
      a plectrum. "I sat with the lute in my lap, trying to reach for
      forgotten notes as my fingers [pluck]ed the strings."

   To [pluck] is to pick or pull a single item out of many, like a flower
   or a hair. As a noun, [pluck] is energy or enthusiasm, even when
   things are looking grim.

   Don't [pluck] only the best cherries off the tree: that's
   cherry-picking! Before you cook a goose, you need to [pluck] its
   feathers. If it looks like your goose is cooked, however, then show
   some [pluck], and figure out a way to save yourself. Some characters
   who are famous for showing [pluck] include the Artful Dodger, Little
   Orphan Annie, and Benji the dog. They all kept their chins up and
   kept on trying, even when things looked really dark.

   The idea of you thinking you had [pluck] enough to lynch a man!

   [Pitiful] means pathetic. If you don't even study for your test,

   The word [pitiful] can be used in a range of contexts. Most commonly,
   you'll see it used as an expression of contempt and pity, the way
   the word pathetic might be used. You might also see it used in
   reference to something unfortunate or deserving of pity — like a
   homeless mother and her child, begging for money on the street.
   Something [pitiful] might also be something very small or inadequate.
   A [pitiful] attempt, is one that isn't good enough.

   they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with courage

   3. remain or be left in a specified condition. "you can [rest] assured

   To [rest] means to relax into something and let it support you. [Rest]
   yourself on the couch for a while, if you're tired.

   The word [rest] comes from the German rasta meaning "league of miles."
   If you walked that far, you'd need a good [rest] too. Whatever way you

   something you take, or something you put your arm up on — you're
   describing a moment of stillness and calm. [Rest] also means "the

      "The old ginger wine storage facility has been divided into

   2. giving an impression of being unconcerned or not serious,

   An [airy] place is full of fresh air. Other [airy] things are either
   light like air or without substance like air.

   Air surrounds us, and it has a lot of meanings. If a place is
   described as [airy], that means it's full of fresh air. An open
   stadium is [airy], while a stuffy apartment is not. If a house has
   lots of open windows, it's [airy]. Also, an argument that has no
   substance can be called [airy], because there's nothing to it. Light
   things are [airy] too: a flimsy, light dress or a low-fat dessert
   could both be called [airy].

   1. a style in which the hair is cut short and evenly all around so

   your head to indicate agreement or get a short haircut that's also
   called a [bob]. The motion [bob] comes from the Old English [bob]ben, "to
   strike," while the hair style stems from the earlier [bob]be, or
   "cluster," and first referred a trimmed horse's tail.

   1. a long, narrow strap attached at one end to a horse's bit,
      typically used in pairs to guide or check a horse while riding or
      driving. "Spotting them, she quickly grabbed the [rein]s and led

   verb
   1. check or guide (a horse) by pulling on its [rein]s. "he [rein]ed in
      his horse and waited for her"

   [Rein] is both a noun and a verb for guiding and restraining. You can
   use the long strap, or [rein], on a horse to control its speed and
   direction, and you can [rein] in your own tongue by closing your

   [Rein] rhymes with rain but the two words describe very different

   [rein] holds things in place or controls what comes out. As a noun,
   [rein] is often used as a plural word "[rein]s" when talking about
   actual leather restraints used in horse riding, but a [rein] also is
   something non-physical like when you put a [rein] on spending by
   shopping less.

   and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by and by all hands
   dropped the [rein]s, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and
   every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean
   over and hump themselves!

   noun
   1. an act of [scamper]ing. "The dim, yellow light each one was

   1. (especially of a small animal or child) run with quick light
      steps, especially through fear or excitement. "he [scamper]ed in

   The verb [scamper] describes something that's moving in disorderly
   haste, often out of fear or excitement. You might notice that

   [scamper] across town in an effort to be on time for your first day of
   work. [Scamper] was a very popular word in the late 1800s.

   preposition
   1. with the legs stretched widely on each side of. "policemen
      sitting [astraddle] motorcycles"

   adjective
   1. with the legs stretched widely on each side.

   When you sit or stand [astraddle] something, you have one leg on each
   side of it. Kids on a seesaw sit [astraddle] as they bounce up and
   down.

   The typical way to ride a horse is [astraddle], with one leg on each
   side of the horse's back, and people also ride bikes and motorcycles
   while sitting [astraddle]. You might even have had a teacher or two
   who preferred to address the class while sitting [astraddle] the
   chair. [Astraddle] comes from the verb straddle, which comes from the
   same Old English root as the word stride — stridan, "to straddle."

   But pretty soon he struggled up [astraddle] and grabbed the bridle,
   a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and
   dropped the bridle and stood!

   Something that's [clogged] is blocked or stopped up. When your sink is
   [clogged], the soapy water can't flow down the drain.

   If your gutters are [clogged] with leaves, rain water will simply flow
   and drip over the edges, and if your arteries become [clogged], you'll
   be at a higher risk for having a heart attack. In both cases, the
   [clogged] things need to be cleared or cleaned out in order to work
   properly. Another way something can be [clogged] is to be clotted or
   thickened: "I don't like this oatmeal because the pieces are all
   [clogged] together."

   He shed them so thick they kind of [clogged] up the air, and
   altogether he shed seventeen suits.

   adjective
   1. extravagantly bright or showy, typically so as to be tasteless.
      "silver bows and [gaudy] ribbons"

   noun
   1. a celebratory reunion dinner or entertainment held by a college.

   Something that's [gaudy] is showy, bright and definitely tacky. So
   think twice about that [gaudy] rainbow-colored suit and shiny gold
   shoes ensemble.

   [Gaudy] is an adjective that means "ostentatious" — in other words,
   flashy and in your face, and not in a good way. Someone in a
   [gaudy] outfit is probably trying too hard to be cool and stylish.
   [Gaudy] evolved from the Middle English gaud “deception, trick” in
   the 1520’s. That word, in turn, came from gaudi, used to describe a
   “large, ornamental bead in a rosary.”

   And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the
   [gaudi]est and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse
   with his whip and made him fairly hum—and finally skipped off, and
   made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody
   just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.

   verb
   1. trouble or annoy (someone) with frequent or persistent requests
      or interruptions. "she constantly [pester]ed him with telephone
      calls"

   To [pester] someone is to annoyingly nag them about something.
   [Pester]ing is repetitive and bothersome.

   When a child asks a parent something over and over again — like "Can
   I have candy? Please? Can I have candy now?" — that's an example of
   [pester]ing. Parents also [pester] kids when they say "Clean your room"
   or "Take out the garbage" over and over. [Pester]ing is like
   requesting, but doing it many times, usually to the point of
   annoyance. No one likes to be [pester]ed.

   1. the patterns of rhythm and sound used in poetry. "the translator

   [Prosody] is the rhythm and sounds used in poetry. Kids who can
   freestyle rap fit the [prosody] of their words to a rhythm that's
   already laid down.

   [Prosody] can also mean the study of the rhythms and sounds of
   language, and sometimes you can talk about the [prosody] of prose.
   It's about where the emphasis falls in the words and how those work
   together. When you read great writers like Alice Munro aloud, you
   will see that their [prosody], as much as anything, is what carries
   the story forward.

   "First, with respect to [prosody], he believes that the syllable count
   of poetic lines, strophes, [stanza]s , and poems was essential to
   the writing of biblical poetry."

    If you are in [arrears], you are behind in the payment of a debt. Think:
    rears=behind. [Arrears] also refers to the unpaid, overdue debt itself.
    Your rent [arrears] are the money you own on rent.

    [Arrears] is a term often used in a legal context––like, when you've had
    to hire a lawyer because you're being sued by your landlord, or being
    evicted because you're in [arrears] on your rent. Before it comes to
    eviction, though, you should try negotiating with your landlord first.
    They would probably be more interested in collecting [arrears], even
    late, than in evicting you and starting with a new tenant from
    scratch.

* seedy :satellite:
[2017-10-11 Wed 05:42]

When a place is seedy, it's sleazy, run-down — not the kind of place
you'd take your mom. The East Village of New York was once known for
being seedy, but now it's safe for children of all ages.

It's a mystery how the word seedy came to mean darkly rundown, slummy,
and seamy, but it probably came from the appearance of flowers after
they've shed their seeds. That's when they start to lose their color
and eventually die. You'll find seedy used to describe places like
dive bars, brothels, and those sections of town where dealers ply
their drugs. Certain writers, such as Dennis Cooper and even Charles
Dickens, are fascinated by the seedy underbelly of life in big cities,
in scenes populated by wretched people and other outcasts.

But today seedy glamour is being replaced by the dim light of
   computer screens and the unhealthy pallor of those who stare into
   them for most of their waking hours.
* mortar :satellite:
[2017-10-11 Wed 05:45]

A mortar is a bowl-shaped container that you can grind things in using
a pestle. You probably buy your spices pre-ground at the store, but if
you wanted to be old-school, you could grind them yourself with a
mortar and pestle.

Mortar is an old word — it comes from Old English, and using a mortar
to smash things up is old way of cooking. It's also the builder's
paste used between bricks. If you've heard the phrase "brick and
mortar," that's a style of building, as well as a general phrase for
something with a real building (as opposed to an internet business).
And it's also a gun that fires high bullets that land short-range.

Once the mortar is dry, you can attach a cutting board to the side
   of the barbecue with fluted masonry nails.
* ramification :satellite:
[2017-10-11 Wed 05:47]

A ramification is an accidental consequence that complicates things.
Remember that time you borrowed your father's car without asking? The
ramification was that Dad missed an important meeting, his company
went under, and he had to sell the car. Oops!

The ramifications are the broader effects that fan out into the world
from one situation, or decision, that kicks it all off. Ramification
also refers to something branching out, like limbs on a tree — which
is what bad decisions tend to do. Ramification is like consequence,
but usually unintended and bad. The word is often used in political
discussions about laws or government decisions because they might be
made locally but could affect people worldwide.

[2017-10-11 Wed 09:56]

A skirmish is a small fight — more a dust-up than a full-out battle —
and it can refer to a physical fight or just a battle of words. It is
definitely confrontational, though.

Think of a skirmish as kind of a mini-battle, although a military
skirmish can end with casualties. Still, although such an encounter
can be serious, even the very word skirmish sounds slight, like a
stirring of dust in the breeze. Shakespeare referred to the combative
nature of his characters Beatrice and Benedick, in "Much Ado About
Nothing," as "a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them."

* harass :satellite:
[2017-10-14 Sat 07:32]

When you harass someone, you bother them to the point of exhaustion.
It’s not that each attack is so severe, it’s the constant small
attacks that wear someone out. If you harass your boss for a raise,
you might end up getting fired instead!

Harass probably comes from the Old French word harer meaning "to set a
dog on." Think of someone being hounded when you use this word. You
can harass your parents with questions or requests, but in turn, they
can also harass you to clean your room! While this is annoying, it's
much worse if you are harassed in the sense of being verbally abused.
The bully at school who harasses some poor kid will be subject to
disciplinary action if a complaint is filed.

* diminutive :satellite:
[2017-10-14 Sat 07:41]

Diminutive means small. A diminutive person is short and small. A
diminutive word is a "cute" version of a word or name: for example,
"duckling" is a diminutive of "duck" and Billy is a diminutive form of
the name William.

A diminutive name or word is formed from another by the addition of a
suffix expressing smallness in size: a booklet is a small book, a
dinette is a small version of a dining set. The adjective diminutive
descends from Middle English, from Old French, from Late Latin
dīminūtīvus, from Latin dēminuere "to lessen."

"He was diminutive, and how he managed to lift the
      heavy [harness] on the draught horses for ploughing was more
      than I could understand."
* concave :satellite:
[2017-10-14 Sat 07:50]

Concave describes an inward curve; its opposite, convex, describes a
curve that bulges outward. They are used to describe gentle, subtle
curves, like the kinds found in mirrors or lenses.

A valley is a concave curve, a mountain is a convex curve—you can
remember this by thinking that things that vex you tend to stick out,
and that caves tend to be holes that go in, like valleys or innie
belly buttons. If you want to describe a bowl, you might say there is
a large blue spot on the center of the concave side.

"It has a large posterior [auricle] that has a concave posterior
    margin meeting the hinge at an [acute] angle."
* posterior :satellite:
[2017-10-14 Sat 07:50]

Use the adjective posterior to describe something that's in the back.
It’s often used in anatomy — a posterior cerebral artery supplies
blood to the back of the brain, and the tail is on the posterior of a
fish.

The prefix post means “after,” and things that are posterior come
after the things in the front. The opposite of posterior is anterior,
which refers to the front, usually of body parts. You can also use the
word posterior to jokingly refer to the part of your body that you sit
on — your backside. Posterior is also a formal way to say later in
time.

"It has a large posterior [auricle] that has a concave posterior
    margin meeting the hinge at an [acute] angle."
* vibrant :satellite:
[2017-11-20 Mon 11:24]

Vibrant colors are bright. Vibrant sounds are loud and resonant.
Vibrant people are ones you remember––they're bright and full of
personality.

Vibrant was originally intended to describe sounds. Sound waves
vibrate, and when they vibrate more rapidly, they sound brighter.
Singers and string instrument players increase this effect by shaking
the notes they play through a technique called vibrato that increases
the vibrancy of their sound.

* bogged :Quora:
[2017-11-25 Sat 12:09]

You'd be pretty soggy by morning if you accidentally set your tent up
in a bog. A bog is a swampy kind of ground made up mostly of
decomposing plants and mosses.

Nothing can be built on a bog because the ground is so spongy and
damp, and no crops can be grown there. The dried soil from a bog can,
however, be dried and burned for fuel. A figurative bog is anything
that you tend to get stuck in, like a bog of health problems. Things
can also "bog you down", or slow you down literally or figuratively,
like when your homework bogs you down so you can't enjoy the weekend.

The beginner programming community seems like a huge ego trip for a lot of
people, don’t get bogged down in it, just learn.
* bewilder :Satellite:
[2017-11-26 Sun 09:09]

To bewilder is to amaze, baffle, dumbfound, flummox, perplex, or
stupefy. When you bewilder people, you confuse them.

Bewilder is a fun-sounding word for confusion-causing. A complicated
math problem will bewilder many students. A magician's tricks should
bewilder the audience. Mystery stories should be a little bewildering,
at least until the end. Sometimes, being bewildered has a more
emotional element. If someone you know died in a freak accident, that
would bewilder you in a very sad way.

* enamel :Satellite:
[2017-11-26 Sun 09:13]

Enamel is the glossy, decorative coating that's applied to metal or
pottery to make it prettier and sometimes sturdier. You might cook a
casserole in your favorite pot, made of blue enamel.

Enamel is used in all kinds of everyday objects, including the surface
of washing machines, baking dishes, and some bath tubs. The enamel
itself is made from melted powdered glass, which can easily be fused
to metal and other surfaces. The outer part of your teeth is also
known as enamel, and though sugar and other foods can decay it, your
tooth enamel is actually the strongest, hardest substance in your
body.

* spur :Satellite:
[2017-11-26 Sun 09:45]

To spur something on is to get it going, to encourage it, to hasten it
or stimulate. Cowboys wear spiky metal tools called spurs on their
boots to kick their horses and spur them to greater speed.

Economists talk of lowering interest rates to spur spending. A new
source of funding for research will hopefully spur new proposals for
research from scientists. An earthquake in China might spur cities in
California to a higher standard of earthquake preparedness. You might
spur your team on to victory by cheering from the sidelines.

* shrewd :Satellite:
[2017-11-26 Sun 09:48]

If you are shrewd in your spending, you can make a small salary go a
long way. Use the adjective shrewd to describe a person or thing that
is smart or clever in a practical sort of way.

The word shrewd is from a Middle English adjective formed from the
noun schrewe "an evil person, a villain." This Middle English noun is
an earlier form of our modern English word shrew. So shrewd and shrew
are related to each other. Shrewd doesn't usually have a disapproving
or negative tone, but shrew certainly does.

* varsity :Satellite:
[2017-11-26 Sun 09:55]

The word varsity identifies the starting team in a sport at a college
or university. You have to be good to make varsity.

At many schools, sports are a big deal. Thousands of people flock to
college football and basketball games, plus other sports. The members
of the starting team are varsity players. Varsity players are the best
players: that’s why they start, and they usually finish the game too.
It can take a while for a player to make varsity status.

If you get good grades, volunteer at the hospital, play varsity
   sports, and write for your school paper, you might be [eligible] for a

* feud :Satellite:
[2017-11-26 Sun 09:58]

A feud is a long-standing fight, often between two families. In Romeo
and Juliet, Shakespeare describes the lovers' long-feuding families,
the Capulets and the Montagues.

Feuds do not have to be violent—what characterizes them is
long-standing hostility. Ethnic groups can sometimes be said to be
feuding. Kids in school who refuse to sit at the same lunch table over
a period of years could describe their relationship as a feud.

But as a noun, a [flap] is a fuss, an argument, or a gossipy feud.
* fuss :Satellite:
[2017-11-26 Sun 09:58]

If you are making a fuss, settle down! A fuss is a state of
excitement, and it's usually about something not worth worrying or
"fussing" about.

Most fusses are types of commotion. If someone makes a fuss, they're
overexcited and in a tizzy over something, like someone who can't stop
asking questions. Another fuss is angrier: you might say "What's the
fuss?" if you hear two people yelling at each other. A fuss is also
any kind of hubbub or whirlwind of activity, like a huge crowd
swarming toward a sale. Parents tend to fuss over their children.
Someone who fusses is worrying too much.

But as a noun, a [flap] is a fuss, an argument, or a gossipy feud.
* tinge :Satellite:
[2017-11-27 Mon 10:55]

A tinge is a slight amount of something, especially a faint color. If
you wear SPF30 to the beach, you'll only come home with a tinge of
tan.

If a painting has just a tiny hint of orange, then it was a tinge of
orange. And you could say the painter tinged the picture with orange
hues. Outside of paint colors, a tinge can mean a small amount of just
about anything. Sometimes you hear about someone speaking with a tinge
of sadness. That means there's just a little bit sadness showing in
their words. A tinge will never bowl you over — it's always small and
subtle.

Given that, in modern usage, [giddy||volatile]
   describes someone silly and frivolous, it's interesting to know
   that the Old English source for this word has a slightly darker
   tinge: gidig means "insane" or "god-possessed."
* despicable :Satellite:
[2017-11-27 Mon 14:16]

Stealing the last piece of food from a starving child goes way beyond
mean. It's despicable — a vile and harmful act.

Mean, nasty, and scummy are synonyms of despicable, but they don't
fully convey the awfulness of despicable. A man who lies to get a
promotion meant for his co-worker would be considered mean. But the
despicable man — the one who is so awful and worthless that he
deserves to be despised — is the one who burns down the office
building and frames his co-worker for it.

* adamant :Satellite:
[2017-11-27 Mon 16:46]

If you stubbornly refuse to change your mind about something, you are
adamant about it.

This word's story begins in ancient Greece, where philosophers spoke
about a legendary unbreakable stone or metal they called adamas
(literally, "invincible"). In English, people began to use the word to
refer to something that cannot be altered, and then in the twentieth
century — after adamant had been in English for about a thousand years
— it came to be used as an adjective to mean "unyielding as stone." If
you're adamant about something, no amount of persuasion is going to
convince you otherwise.

* conscience :Satellite:
[2017-11-27 Mon 16:50]

A conscience is a built-in sense of what's right and what's wrong.
That sick feeling in your stomach after you meanly told your younger
brother the truth about Santa Claus? That might be your conscience
bothering you.

The word conscience contains the word science, which comes from the
Latin word scientia, meaning "to know" or "knowledge." You can think
of your conscience as your knowledge of yourself, especially when it
comes to your own morals, or your feelings about right and wrong.
Pangs of conscience, which feel like an uncomfortable inner voice, are
helpful when you're trying to decide the right thing to do in a
particular situation.

* affable :Satellite:
[2017-11-27 Mon 16:50]

Affable means friendly, pleasant, and easy to talk to. An affable host
offers you something to drink and makes you feel at home.

The adjective affable entered English by way of the Latin word
affābilis, which means "kind, friendly." If you’re stuck on an
airplane next to someone affable, the trip won’t be so bad because
that person will be easy to chat with but won’t talk your ear off.
Synonyms of affable also refer to a pleasant and mild friendliness,
such as genial, hospitable, and gracious. Affable people generally
seem like they’re in a good mood and are happy to see you.

* impish :Satellite:
[2017-11-27 Mon 16:56]

If you know someone who's playful and mischievous, you can describe
them as impish. Your impish little brother probably gets away with all
kinds of pranks because he's so cute.

If you're impish, you might play practical jokes on people, tease
them, tickle them, or be otherwise cheerfully annoying. The
troublemaker in a kindergarten class is likely to be fairly impish,
naughty and a little silly. The adjective impish comes from imp, a
mythological creature that's similar to a fairy but known in folklore
for its jokes and pranks.

This reminded Theodore of one of
his fantastic but true Corfu anecdotes, which he related to us with impish glee.
* glee :Satellite:
[2017-11-27 Mon 16:57]

If you learned that you'd won a trip for four to Disney World, it
would be hard to hide your glee. Glee means extreme happiness or
delight.

Anything that makes you full of joy, so happy you could laugh out
loud, fills you with glee. If your favorite football team wins the
Super Bowl, your glee will make you cheer, and a kid let loose with a
ten dollar bill in a candy shop might dance around with glee. In the
1700s and 1800s, a glee was a song written for men's a cappella
singing groups, which were sometimes called glee clubs.

* plump :Satellite:

Something that's plump has a nice round shape. You could describe
watching your plump little cousin eating one plump grape after
another.

Objects and people can both be described as plump, as long as they're
full or round or chubby. Though some people might be offended by being
called plump, it's meant to describe an appealing roundness. And when
you plump something, you pat or shake it so that it becomes fuller:
"Let me plump those pillows on the bed while you tuck the sheets in."

* portly :Satellite:
[2017-11-27 Mon 17:06]

Don't call someone fat. Be nice, and call them portly. Portly is just
one of several words that are kinder than "fat," including "stout,"
"heavy," and "pleasingly plump."

The tenor was portly, but all that girth makes it easier for him to
produce all that sound. One way to remember the meaning of the word
portly is to think of a bottle of port, the sweet wine that tastes
like sherry and is notoriously calorific. Want to be less portly? Then
try drinking less port and other alcoholic beverages.

Their prey

[2017-11-28 Tue 08:21]

You know how you feel when you can’t open a jar of pickles? And then
grandma walks in and does it in one shot without even grunting? That’s
called feeling feeble, or lacking strength.

In fact, feeble, comes from the Latin word flebilis, which means
"lamentable" or "unsatisfactory." But don’t let it get to you. Your
puny, inferior muscles are nothing compared to the guy who makes
feeble attempts at humor. Lame-o jokes are way more lamentable than
inadequate biceps.

If you are trying to say the same thing about a person,
   but more nicely, you might use the word, feeble, which means weak,

* nefarious :Satellite:
[2017-11-28 Tue 11:31]

Describe a person's actions as nefarious if they are evil or wicked.
Batman and Superman are always fighting evildoers and stopping their
nefarious plots.

Nefarious comes from the Latin nefas "crime, impiety." If something is
nefarious, it is criminal, evil, malicious and wicked. Thinking of
superheroes can help you remember the meaning of the word, but it is
often used in much less exciting circumstances. News reporters
investigate corrupt politicians in order to uncover the nefarious
activities. And, if you don't pay for your downloaded music, you have
gotten it by nefarious means.

If you're looking for a formal adjective to describe something sly or

The adjective, furtive, is related to fūrtum, the Latin word for theft
or robbery. This is apparent as the expressions "to give someone a
furtive glance" and "to steal a glance at someone" mean the same
thing. If a person's manner is furtive, he or she is acting

they lack this image of a thief's actions.

Have you ever seen people who can bend so easily, they can touch their
heels to the back of their heads? Those people are, in a word, lithe.

Lithe comes to us from Old English and originally meant "mild, meek."
As a meek person bends to the will of others, the meaning of lithe has
broadened to flexible and even graceful. Think of a dancer or the ease
of a sleek cat when you think of lithe. You can use it to describe a
person or the way someone moves.

Thus the hunting wasps

* impeccable :Satellite:
[2017-12-03 Sun 13:10]

The adjective impeccable describes something or someone without any
flaws. A stand-up comedian needs impeccable timing for his jokes to
work.

The adjective impeccable refers to something or someone without
marking or error — but it can also mean to be spotless or clean. The
word comes from the Latin impeccabilis and means "to be sinless,"
which is also one of the senses, now outdated, in English. You can see
how "clean" comes from "sinless." Because of the messy nature of
picnic food, it is highly unlikely that you would leave with your
clothing still as impeccable as when you arrived, especially if you
like mustard and ketchup!

To extinguish something means to put an end to it, and get rid of it
completely. Water can extinguish a fire; nasty smells can extinguish
your appetite.

Extinguish comes from the Latin word for quench, but while we might
think that quenching something, say our thirst, is good, the word
extinguish often has sinister overtones. In a genocide, one group
tries to extinguish another — too quench their hatred, by killing
everyone in the other group.

But my view of these performances was all too short, for almost as soon as I switched on
the torch the partners would stop, pause for a moment, and then, seeing that I was not going to
extinguish the light, they would turn round and walk firmly away, claw in claw, side by side.

If you don't notice or aren't aware, it means that the adjective
oblivious applies to you!

When we think of the adjective oblivious, it is usually in situations
that involve being totally unaware of what's staring us right in the
face. It can also mean being forgetful and absent-minded. The cartoon
character Mr. Magoo is a perfect example of someone who is oblivious;
his eyesight is so bad that he always gets himself into various
scrapes and mishaps. For example, Mr. Magoo mistakes an airplane for a
theater and instead of watching a movie, he takes a seat on a
departing airplane!

If something is impending, it is about to happen. If you hear thunder

The word impending often refers to something threatening or
frightening: impending doom, impending disaster. Something that is
impending hangs over you — you might say, "I was so distracted by

railroad tracks, he dooms you to certain death!

Doctor Doom is a comic book villain you do not want to mess with. He’s
the doctor of death! If you feel that the world is terrible, you’re

on a bike zooming uncontrollably down a steep hill.

Speed can be a noun or verb. As a noun, it's an indicator of pace, as
in the speed of a car. As a noun, it's also a drug that keeps you
awake, very awake. As a verb, it means to “move along quickly,” like
how you speed around on your bike. A fun fact: while speed refers to
the distance traveled by an object during a specific amount of time,
velocity describes that distance, but in a specified direction.

Thoroughly enraged at this treatment, the creature sped towards Leslie, her sting quivering with
emotion.
* pandemonium :Satellite:
[2017-12-03 Sun 13:19]

Pandemonium is chaos, total and utter craziness — like the stampede
after your team won the championship, when everyone spilled onto the
field at once, bouncing off each other.

If you look carefully at the word pandemonium, you’ll see the word
demon inside it. This makes sense, since the word pandemonium was
coined in Milton’s Paradise Lost, where it was the name of the palace
built in the middle of Hell. Milton wrote back in the 17th century.
Nowadays, pandemonium crops up whenever journalists are describing a
chaotic scene. High school students have been heard to use it to
describe their lunchroom.

Mother, completely bewildered by this sudden and rapid
change from peace to chaos, put-on her glasses and peered down the table to see what was causing the
pandemonium, and at that moment Margo, in a vain attempt to stop the scorpion's advance, hurled a glass
of water at it.
* rickety :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:00]

Something rickety — like an old shack — is shaky and likely to fall
down because it's fragile.

Some buildings are sturdy, solid, and strong. Others are rickety:
rickety things might blow over from a slight breeze. Rickety things
are poorly designed or have just become rickety because of aging.
Rickety things tend to shake, which is a sign they might fall apart
any second. If you put a heavy load in a rickety cart, you might lost
your load!

Right in the very centre, in
the top flat of a tall, rickety building that leant tiredly over a tiny square, lived the Belgian consul.
* verge :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:02]

Think of an edge, a border, a boundary, and you are thinking about the
verge, the point where something begins or ends.

We talk about a nervous person being on the verge of a breakdown, or
about a scientist being on the verge of a major breakthrough, but the
British have another good physical meaning: they call the strip of
grass that borders a walkway the verge, giving you a clear mental
picture that goes beyond the abstract.

He
took his job rather seriously, and was always dressed as though he
were on the verge of rushing off to some important official
function, in a black cut-away coat, striped trousers, fawn spats
over brightly polished shoes, an immense cravat like a silk
waterfall, held in place by a plain gold pin, and a tall and
gleaming top hat that completed the ensemble.
* amicably :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:06]

When you do something amicably, you're doing it politely and nicely.
It's best to deal with traffic cops and waiters amicably.

This word for doing things in a pleasant manner is often used in not
so amicable situations. Let's say a couple gets divorced — if they
parted amicably, then there wasn't a lot of yelling and screaming, and
they both agreed to it. You could say two countries that dislike each
other had a meeting of their leaders that was conducted amicably: they
were polite and said nice things, even though that's not necessarily
how they felt.

'You will please to read zis,' he said, his gold teeth glittering
amicably in his beard.
* haste :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:08]

When something is done in haste, it's done fast, and often with
carelessness. In his haste to finish the paper, he didn't notice he
had replaced "taste" with "waste" during spell-checking, so his title
became "Foods of Our Home State: What a Waste!"

The old saying goes "haste makes waste," and when you try to do things
too quickly, sometimes you do them wrong or have to do them all over
again. You can use the noun haste for things done with extraordinary
speed and often in a situation where there's pressure to perform or
complete a task. "In her haste to catch the train she ran six blocks,
but when she boarded, she noticed she was wearing one blue tennis shoe
and one red one."

He loaded the weapon, dropping pellets all
over the carpet in his frantic haste.
* handkerchief :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:09]

A handkerchief is a square of fabric that you can use to blow your
nose. You can also tuck a handkerchief in the breast pocket of a suit,
or wear it tied jauntily around your neck.

You can call a handkerchief a "hanky," or just a kerchief, although
this more often means "a square piece of cloth worn as a head
covering." This last part of handkerchief comes from the Old French
couvrechief, literally meaning "cover head," from couvrir, "cover,"
and chief, "head." So a handkerchief is a similar cloth held in the
hand — to mop your brow or wipe your eyes.

He
drew a yard or so of silk handkerchief out of his breast pocket and
blew his nose violently.
* incessant :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:11]

Something incessant continues without interruption. When you're on a
cross-country flight, it's tough to tolerate the incessant crying of a
baby.

In Latin, cessare means 'to stop,' so when you add the negative prefix
in- you get a word meaning never stopping. A near synonym is
continual, but something incessant is more relentless; ceaseless is a
closer synonym. It's rare to find incessant used in a positive way.
Even incessant sunshine would grow boring.

It was a
week before I found out the reason for the consul's incessant
fusillade, and the reason was cats.
* fusillade :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:12]

When you watch an action movie, the hero's deadly fusillade often
results in at least one of his enemies being shot. The noun fusillade
describes a quick round of gunfire.

To correctly pronounce fusillade, say "FEW sill ahd." The word
probably reminds you of fuselage, the part of an aircraft where crew
members and passengers sit. But the words only sound alike. Fuselage
gets its name from its cylinder shape, while fusillade comes from the
French word fusil, meaning "musket." Fusillade also can be used in a
figurative sense to describe a rapid series of anything, such as a
fusillade of punches or a fusillade of questions.

It was a
week before I found out the reason for the consul's incessant
fusillade, and the reason was cats.
* plunge :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:14]

Plunge is a noun and a verb related to diving, falling, and sinking. A
"polar bear plunge" is when people plunge into freezing cold water for
charity or, inexplicably, for fun.

As a noun, plunge means “a brief swim” or “a fall.” As a verb, plunge
has a variety of definitions. Plunge can mean “to devote yourself
fully," as you might plunge into a job by working day and night.
Similarly, if you plunge into a good book, you don't let anything
distract you from your reading. Plunge can also mean “fall abruptly.”
Someone’s reputation might plunge after a scandal, or the stock market
might plunge when investors react to bad news.

After
the report of the gun there would be a moment's silence, in respect
for the dead, and then the consul would blow his nose violently,
sigh tragically, and we would plunge once more into the tangled
labyrinth of French verbs.
* inexplicable :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:15]

Something inexplicable can't be explained. It doesn't make sense. You
don't want to come to the beach on the most beautiful day of the year?
That's inexplicable!

Inexplicable is made up of the prefix in, which means "not," and
explicable, which comes from the Latin explicabilis, meaning
"unfolded, unraveled." Do you see the double negative? If something is
not unfolded, it's folded up and tangled — like something that doesn't
make sense. Your school's decision to call a snow day is inexplicable,
if there's barely a layer of snow on the ground.

For some inexplicable reason the consul was under the impression
that Mother could speak French, and he would never lose an
opportunity of engaging her in conversation.
* swamped :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:17]

A swamp is an area that floods every year because the land is low.
Watch out for alligators if you visit Atchafalaya National Wildlife
Refuge in Louisiana, the largest swamp in the United States.

Anyone who has spent time in a busy restaurant kitchen has heard
harried chefs cry, "I'm in the weeds!" Such people are in a different
kind of swamp — the challenging environment in which too many things
need to be done in too short a time. Another way of saying this is,
"I'm swamped." Here swamp is a verb that describes being stuck in a
seemingly endless situation — you feel like you're stuck in the
squishy mud of a real swamp.

Then they
would stand in the middle of the street, occasionally being forced
apart by a passing donkey, while the consul swamped Mother under a
flood of French, gesturing elegantly with his hat and stick,
apparently unaware of the blank expression on Mother's face.
* cue :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:18]

A cue is the long stick used for playing pool. A cue is also a
reminder or stimulus to do something.

In pool, you use the cue to hit the white ball into the red ball,
aiming for a pocket. Other cues make things happen too. In acting, a
lighting change or another actor's line could be a cue for you to
enter the stage. During rehearsal, the actors need to learn their cues
to make sure their timing is right. A cue can also be a clue or
reminder of something. Anytime someone has good timing, they're on
cue.

and this was Mother's cue.
* ordeal :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:19]

An ordeal is something difficult or painful to go through. Something
kind of hard like taking a test can be an ordeal, but often an ordeal
is a serious and long-lasting event, like an illness or tragedy.

When you go through an ordeal you have to deal with something tough.
Waiting for someone you love to recover from an injury and come home
from the hospital is an ordeal––for both of you––and being a victim of
a crime is a different kind of ordeal. You can use this noun in an
exaggerated way, too, as when you endure the long ordeal of cleaning
the garage on a sunny weekend.

But these
conversations were a nerve-racking ordeal for her, and we had only
to hiss 'Look out, Mother, the consul's coming,' to set her tearing
off down the street at a lady-like walk that was dangerously near to
a gallop.
* sorties :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:20]

When a group of soldiers is sent on a specific mission, it's called a
sortie. A fighter pilot's sortie might involve a mission to drop a
bomb on a target and return to base.

When a fighting unit is deployed, heading out on a military mission,
you can describe it as a sortie. A sortie might involve troops moving
across a field toward their enemy, or a tank advancing on a city held
by rebels. Sometimes a sortie involves a sudden surge or attack. In
French, the word sortie literally means "a going out," from a Latin
root, surgere, or "rise up."

In some ways these French lessons were good for me; I did not learn
any French, it's true, but by the end of the morning I was so bored
that my afternoon sorties into the surrounding country were made
with double the normal enthusiasm.
* bristle :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:23]

A bristle is a stiff hair — the kind men shave off their face or the
kind badgers have all over. Bristle also means to get angry. Tell an
animal rights activist you use a badger's bristle shaving brush and
you'll get the idea.

The emotional meaning of to bristle comes from the fact that most
animal bristles used by man are so-called erectile hairs — the ones
that stand up on the neck or along the back of animal when it's angry
or surprised. A common word associated with bristle is hackle, another
name for such erectile animal hairs. Thus the saying "to get one's
hackles up," which is pretty much identical to bristling.

Theodore, in the middle of an
anecdote or an explanation, would suddenly stop talking, his eyes
would take on a fanatical gleam, his beard would bristle, and he
would cock his head on one side.
* alacrity :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:25]

Someone with alacrity shows cheerful willingness and eager behavior,
like a kid whose mother has told him he can buy anything in a candy
store.

While the noun alacrity normally refers to someone's peppy behavior,
it can also describe a certain mood or tempo of a musical composition,
indicating how the music should be played. Alacrity comes from the
Latin alacritas, and the Italian musical term allegro is a near
relation.

' Theodore would mumble,
vacating his seat with alacrity.
* rasp :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:28]

When you rasp, you either file wood with a metal tool, or you speak in
a harsh, irritating voice. Your rasp-y voice might get you a gig as a
lounge singer, but probably not as a preschool teacher.

The tool called a rasp is a special kind of wood file that's much
coarser than sandpaper, and when you use it, you rasp. If you've ever
cared for a horse's hooves, you may have also used a rasp to file
them. The "speak gratingly" meaning of rasp comes from the "scraping"
sense of the word. If your voice sounds like a rasp against a rough
surface, you're rasping.

As it came
slowly to rest, Theodore would rasp the side of his beard with his
thumb, and ease himself back into the attic.
* confining :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:29]

When something is confining it limits you and holds you in. If you
find living in a small town confining, you probably feel
claustrophobic, like there's not enough room there for you and your
aspirations.

The -fin- in confining is the same root that's found in words such as
the French word fin, meaning "end" or "limit." The con- is the
familiar Latin suffix that means "together." So when something is
confining, it's like a border drawn around you. In some cases,
confining can be a good thing, like when your efforts at confining the
fire to the kitchen saved the rest of the house.

It was on Thursdays that Theodore and I went out together, sometimes
confining ourselves to the garden, sometimes venturing further
afield.
* apparently :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:30]

Apparently is an adverb meaning "evidently" or "obviously." After his
sixth hot dog, you might say to your friend, "Well! Apparently
somebody was hungry!"

While apparently can mean "plainly" — like, duh — it can also mean
"seemingly," which is almost "evidently" or "obviously," but not
quite. There's a certain amount of guessing involved, based on
appearances. The park ranger who shows up in the morning to examine
the path of destruction through your campsite might say that it was
"apparently the work of a hungry bear," not because he's totally sure,
but because it definitely looks like something the bears around here
would do.

Theodore had an apparently
inexhaustible fund of knowledge about everything, but he imparted
this knowledge with a sort of meticulous diffidence that made you
feel he was not so much teaching you something new, as reminding you
of something which you were already aware of, but which had, for
some reason or other, slipped your mind.
* imparted :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:30]

Let me impart a little bit of knowledge to you about the word impart.
It means to pass on, transmit, or bestow. If you share this with your
study partner, you are imparting your new wisdom.

Studying imparts confidence as well as information, long life imparts
wisdom, and anise seed imparts the flavor of licorice. Your mother can
impart the importance of dressing neatly each and every day. Though it
shares a root with the word part, impart doesn't mean to split into
pieces, but rather to divide or share with another. Let me impart this
message to you — always do your part!

Theodore had an apparently
inexhaustible fund of knowledge about everything, but he imparted
this knowledge with a sort of meticulous diffidence that made you

some reason or other, slipped your mind.
* relish :satellite:
[2017-12-25 Mon 10:31]

Relish isn't just a hotdog topping. The verb relish means to enjoy
something immensely. You may relish eating the relish on your hotdog,
or you may relish taking an afternoon nap.

The word relish has been around since the 16th century and comes to us
from the French, who are pretty good at indulging and savoring. When
at a dinner party, win points with your host by sighing happily after
each bite to show just how much you relish the meal. Relish is also a
kind of spicy or savory condiment, the stuff you slather on hotdogs or
hamburgers. So if you're fickle when it comes to pickles, you might
ask them to hold the relish.

His conversation was
sprinkled with hilarious anecdotes, incredibly bad puns, and even
worse jokes, which he would tell with great relish, his eyes
twinkling, his nose wrinkled as he laughed silently in his beard, as
much at himself as at his own humour.
* girders :satellite:
[2018-01-04 Thu 16:51]

A girder is any of the many beams used in buildings and bridges that
provide support and actually hold them up.

If you've ever seen a building going up, you know the first they do is
put up a steel or wood skeleton that will eventually take the weight
of the roof, the siding, the floors and all the rooms inside. That
skeleton is made of girders. Bridges also are made with girders, but
they usually remain visible long after the steel beams in buildings
have been covered by glass, brick and wood.

Sven was one of our best construction men, and excelled at the tricky and
specialized work of collecting assorted girders as they floated around in
free fall, making them do the slow-motion, three-dimensional ballet that
would get them into their right positions, and fusing the pieces together
when they were precisely dovetailed into the intended pattern.
* dovetailed :satellite:
[2018-01-04 Thu 16:54]

A dovetail is a joint in woodworking where two sides are fitted
together with interlocking pieces. You can also use the word dovetail
to show how other things fit well together — like how your picnic
plans nicely dovetail with the sunny forecast.

A well-made dovetail is a beautiful thing, with wooden projections
that slide into notches perfectly, the two sides forming a corner.
When things fit this way, you can say they dovetail — they fit easily
and work well together. Your plan to dress up as a Jedi knight
dovetails well with your brother's Darth Vader costume, for example.
Dovetails got their name from the tail feather-like shape of the
joint's pieces.

Sven was one of our best construction men, and excelled at the tricky and
specialized work of collecting assorted girders as they floated around in

when they were precisely dovetailed into the intended pattern.
* garbs :satellite:
[2018-01-04 Thu 16:55]

Your garb is what you are wearing — your clothing. You may choose the
garb of an auto mechanic, even though you don’t know the difference
between a carburetor and a catalytic converter, just because you like
the look.

Within your closet, you probably have the garb of a student — casual
clothes that are just right for school — along with the more formal
garb you are expected to wear for holidays at your grandmother's house
or when giving a speech. When you usually see your buddy, the Marine,
in his military garb, it might catch you by surprise when you see him
flopped on his couch in the garb of a lazy lounger.

I never
tired of watching him and his gang as the station grew under their hands
like a giant jigsaw puzzle; it was a skilled and difficult job, for a
space suit is not the most convenient of garbs in which to work.
* infinitesimal :satellite:
[2018-01-04 Thu 16:57]

When it's incalculably small, when teensy seems large compared to it,
then it is infinitesimal. "The equipment was so sensitive that even
the infinitesimal dust molecules that swept in with the open door
altered the readings."

Infinitesimal is such an extreme description of a microscopic
something that the word is used as an exaggeration more often than to
describe something actually quite small. "The chances of Roxy going
out on a date with Norbert were infinitesimal. She barely even knew he
existed." Infinitesimal has as its root infinite which usually
conjures up thoughts of immeasurably large quantities or sizes. In
this case infinite refers to something immeasurably small.

Claribel weighed practically nothing, her food requirements
were infinitesimal—and she was not worried, as most animals would have
been, by the absence of gravity.
* retort :satellite:
[2018-01-04 Thu 17:09]

A retort is a short, clever response to someone's comment or question.
If you want to keep the peace during dinner, you should probably bite
your tongue instead of making sarcastic retorts to everything your
little sister says.

Today retort is used as both a noun and a verb, and both come from
16th- and 17th-century sources meaning "to twist or turn back." To
retort is to make a comeback, or a quick, witty answer or remark. It
can be a form of payback when someone tries to insult or tease another
person, and often, the perfect retort doesn't occur to you till later,
when you think "Oh! I wish I had said that earlier!"

Before I could retort that she usually woke me up, too, Sven came in
through the doorway, and we could see at once that something was wrong.
* lamented :satellite:
[2018-01-04 Thu 17:12]

Use the adjective lamented to talk fondly about someone who's died.
You might describe your favorite elementary school teacher as "my dear
lamented Mrs. McGinty."

Lamented is often used in the phrase "late lamented," which implies
that the person you're talking about is dead and that you really miss
him or her. Inanimate objects can also be lamented, like the
neighborhood book shop that closed, or a magazine you used to read
that is no longer in print. The root Latin word is lamentationem,
which describes wailing, moaning, and weeping.

“I don’t get it,” lamented Sven.
* sprained :satellite:
[2018-01-05 Fri 17:57]

To sprain one of your joints is to twist it suddenly. The result is a
sprain, in which the ligaments have been injured. Don’t go hiking in
high heels because you might sprain your ankle.

A sprain — which occurs at joints such as the wrist, elbow, or knee —
happens when the ligaments are turned quickly and painfully. After the
initial pain, a sprain will swell up. Spraining something is
difficult, but things could be worse — a sprained knee will heal
quicker than a broken bone.

I shot up to the ceiling before I was able to grab
a stanchion and bring myself to a halt, at the cost of a sprained wrist.
* predicament :satellite:
[2018-01-05 Fri 18:00]

If you're engaged to get married but suddenly fall in love with
someone else, you have gotten yourself into quite a predicament. A
predicament is a difficult, confusing, and unpleasant situation.

The Greek word that predicament originally descends from means "a
state of being." Which makes sense considering the words that sound
like predicate are all about states of being––predict, or say what's
going to happen in the future, and predicate the second part of a
sentence that's led by the verb. Think of predicament as an unpleasant
state of being.

For all we knew, the whole structure might have come to pieces, and all
our colleagues might be dead or in the same predicament as we—drifting
through space in leaking cans of air.
* conniving :satellite:
[2018-01-05 Fri 18:17]

Someone conniving is calculating, scheming, and shrewd — in other
words, sneaky and up to no good.

Do you know anyone who is always trying to get away with things? Do
they constantly look for ways to get out of trouble or work? Those
kind of people are conniving. This is a word for secretive, shifty
behavior. However, being conniving isn't the worst thing in the world
— it's negative, but you probably wouldn't say a murderer is
conniving. It's usually reserved for con men, shady business moguls,
and manipulative social climbers.

Heaven knows how much conniving, blackmail, and downright character
assassination went on behind the scenes.
* blackmail :satellite:
[2018-01-05 Fri 18:17]

To blackmail someone is to use secret information to get something
from them, usually money. Blackmailing is a crime.

Blackmail is a type of threat. For example, if a politician's
assistant knew the politician was having an affair, the assistant
could blackmail the politician by threatening to tell the press.
Blackmailers usually want money in return for keeping something a
secret, but an employee with dirt on a boss could blackmail the boss
to get a promotion. Anyone making threats and demands in return for
keeping a secret is engaged in blackmail.

Heaven knows how much conniving, blackmail, and downright character
assassination went on behind the scenes.
* relished :satellite:
[2018-01-05 Fri 18:20]

Relish isn't just a hotdog topping. The verb relish means to enjoy

He also relished the low gravity; at the station’s rim, a man
had half his normal, Earth weight—and at the axis he had no weight at
all.
* pang :satellite:
[2018-01-19 Fri 16:53]

A pang is a sharp jab or an intense hurt that comes on suddenly. If
you've felt an all-of-a-sudden, deep sadness that seems to hit you
even in the back of the eyes, you've probably had a pang of emotion
over a loss or a tragic story.

You can feel a physical pain or pang right when you get hurt, or you
might suffer a pang of guilt that keeps popping up if you don't own up
to something bad. Pang sounds close to pain, and it is pain, but it
has a sharper edge — it's intense and comes on fast. A childbirth pain
often is called a pang, because it's such a unique type of hurting.
Having a pang of regret can be almost as sharp.

At first we were both so busy that the pang of separation was somewhat
lessened.
* unaided :satellite:
[2018-01-19 Fri 17:01]

Anything that's unaided is done without any help. When a child tries
to make dessert by himself, he may make an unaided attempt at baking
cookies.

Use the adjective unaided to describe something that doesn't require
help or assistance. The word often refers to a physical process that
you can do on your own, like unaided walking: you don't need crutches,
a cane, or people to help you. It can also be used to refer to other
forms of assistance. For example, someone may say that a politician
was unaided by her speechwriters when composing her acceptance speech.

At mid-flight I’d have to spin the scooter around and start braking,
and ten minutes later the observatory would be close enough for its
details to be visible to the unaided eye.
* inconceivably :satellite:
[2018-01-19 Fri 17:04]


The thought of a collision never even crossed my mind; space is so
inconceivably vast that I was thousands of times safer than a man
crossing a busy street on Earth.

* dwindled :satellite:
[2018-01-19 Fri 17:05]

What do love, money, and the earth all have in common? All can
dwindle, or shrink away, if we don't handle them properly.

The word dwindle has a wonderfully descriptive, almost childlike sound
to it, as though it belongs in a nursery rhyme. That might help you
remember the meaning, which is to shrink away gradually, like the
Cheshire Cat in "Alice in Wonderland," who dwindles away until nothing
is left but his grin.

Now it was moving as fast as I could turn my head; it grew to a tiny,
misshaped moon, then dwindled and shrank with that same silent,
inexorable speed.
* haunted :satellite:
[2018-01-19 Fri 17:06]

Something that's haunted seems to have ghosts. Visiting a scary
haunted house is a great, if terrifying, way to spend Halloween night.

Ghosts, or spooky apparitions, are what makes a place haunted. You
might truly believe your grandparents' house is haunted, or it might
just seem that way because of the scary creaks and groans in the
night, the cobwebs in dark corners, and the dim lighting. You can also
describe a person as haunted when she's obsessed with or tormented by
something: "I was haunted by the memory of my cat killing that poor
mouse."

I suppose I had a clear view of it for perhaps half a second, and that
half-second has haunted me all my life.
* recapture :satellite:
[2018-01-19 Fri 17:08]

To recapture something is to get it back or catch it again. If you
were the zookeeper at a very disorganized zoo, one of your jobs might
be to recapture runaway baby pandas.

The police might recapture an escaped prisoner, and when they do it
they can call the act itself a recapture. You can also recapture
things in a more figurative way — your dad might like to recapture his
high school days by listening to 80s music, for example. The "again"
prefix re- is added to capture, from Latin captura, "a taking."

But I had no measurements of speed or direction; whatever it was that I
had glimpsed was now lost beyond recapture in the wastes of the solar

[2018-01-29 Mon 17:11]

To cheat is to use sneaky, unfair methods to get something you want.
No one's going to want to play with you if you always cheat at mini
golf.

Some people cheat at cards, and others cheat during math tests by
copying from the student beside them. In either case, they're trying
to succeed using underhanded tricks. You can refer to someone who does
this as a cheat as well. Cheat comes from the Old French escheat, a
legal term for the state taking someone's property when he or she dies
without heirs. This practice was resented, and it came to mean
"confiscate unfairly."

* crook :satellite:
[2018-01-29 Mon 17:15]

A crook is long staff that’s bent at one end, like something you might
see a shepherd carrying. A crook can also be a criminal — a person
who’s dishonest, or bent, just like the staff.

The noun crook entered English in the 13th century as a way to
describe the long tool with a hook at one end. It later took on the
meaning of “petty criminal.” You can use crook as an informal way to
describe someone who is dishonest. A crook is typically involved in
minor or nonviolent crimes; you wouldn’t use the word to describe a
murderer, for example. A con man or someone committing fraud could be
called a crook.

Later, the same friend who wanted me to get "info" and "figure out how
he does it" said to me: "we knew all along he was a crook."
* ample :satellite:
[2018-01-30 Tue 08:40]

Ample describes an abundance of something. An ample supply of apple
muffins at the bake sale is a good thing, as is ample legroom in your
new van, but you probably don't want your ample waistline spilling
over the top of your jeans.

Like amplify (crank up the volume), ample is from the Latin word
amplus, meaning "large or spacious" and has the word plus in it, like
plus-sized models. Ample can be enough or even too much of something.
It's great when there's ample parking or water for the hike, but there
are things that some people don't want more of, like extra pounds.
It's a cheeky insult to tell someone he or she has ample thighs, but
we'd all be happy if we had ample time and money.

There is now ample scope for employment of formal methods
researchers in applied industrial research.
* dispose :satellite:
[2018-01-30 Tue 08:42]

If you dispose of something, you get rid of it. Don't want that
sweatshirt with the clown's face on it? Give it away, throw it out,
even sell it — these are all ways to dispose of that awful shirt.

The verb dispose comes from the Latin word disponere, meaning “put in
order,” “arrange,” or “distribute" — like when you dispose volunteers
to collect trash at a park. The word of usually follows dispose when
it means "getting rid of something." Another meaning is "make willing
or open to something," like your childhood love of reading that
disposes you to becoming a life-long reader.

In 1969, I was afraid industrial research would dispose such
vastly superior resources that the academic researcher would be
well advised to withdraw from competition and move to a new area
of research
* pluck :satellite:
[2018-01-30 Tue 08:43]

To pluck is to pick or pull a single item out of many, like a flower
or a hair. As a noun, pluck is energy or enthusiasm, even when things
are looking grim.

Don't pluck only the best cherries off the tree: that's
cherry-picking! Before you cook a goose, you need to pluck its
feathers. If it looks like your goose is cooked, however, then show
some pluck, and figure out a way to save yourself. Some characters who
are famous for showing pluck include the Artful Dodger, Little Orphan
Annie, and Benji the dog. They all kept their chins up and kept on
trying, even when things looked really dark.

The goal of industrial research is (and should always be) to
pluck the 'low-hanging fruit'; that is, to solve the easiest
parts of the most prevalent problems, in the particular
circumstances of here and now.
* convincing :satellite:
[2018-01-30 Tue 08:48]

When something is convincing, it makes people agree with what it
claims to be true. Describe an argument as convincing if it wins you
over and makes you believe in its rightness.

To figure out what convincing means, remember that vincere is the
Latin word for "to conquer." Add on the prefix con-, meaning "with,"
and you get something that has the ability to conquer — whether it's
doubts, disbelief, or hostility. The suffix -ing tells you that the
word describes the action or result of something. The result of a
convincing argument is more people who have joined your side or cause.

The remaining opportunity and obligation for the scientist is to
conduct convincing experiments, to check whether the tools, and
the theories on which they are based, are adequate to cover the
vast range of programs, design patterns, languages, and
applications of today's computers
* rivalry :satellite:
[2018-01-30 Tue 08:51]

Rivalry is the act of competing for the same thing against another
person. Your rivalry with your older sister is amusing to the family
but very annoying to her.

Rivalry comes from the noun rival, the person you compete against.
Often a rivalry starts when people want the same reward — and their
talents are just about equal. Your rivalry for the lead in the play at
the local theater isn't between you and George Clooney — it's between
you and the other guy who also had a great audition.

Scientific rivalry between experimenters and between tool
builders can thereby lead to an exponential growth in the
capabilities of the tools.
* ripe :satellite:
[2018-01-30 Tue 16:57]

When a fruit is ripe, it is time to pick it and eat it. If you say the
time is ripe, then now is the time for action. Ripe means ready.

Ripe can also describe something that is not only ready to happen but
well-suited for whatever is happening. A company can expect profits if
the market is ripe for its product. When a ballpark has a short field,
batters will say that the field is ripe for home runs. When things are
ripe, it's a good thing — the time for action is now.

This paper argues that the time is ripe to embark on an
international Grand Challenge project to construct a program
verifier that would use logical proof to give an automatic check
of the correctness of programs submitted to it.
* embark :satellite:
[2018-01-30 Tue 16:58]

When you embark on something, you are starting it — and it's exciting.
You might embark on a new career or embark on a trip to the Galapagos
Islands. You wouldn't embark on a trip to the grocery store.

The verb embark can be used specifically to refer to boarding a ship
for a journey. When used for general travel, the verb embark often
implies a longer journey: "She embarked on a trip around the world."
Besides, physical journeys, embark can be used to mean to start other
kinds of journeys as well. You might embark on a spiritual journey or
embark on the path to enlightenment. Pack well.

* afflict :satellite:
[2018-01-30 Tue 16:59]

To afflict is to cause suffering, pain, or misery. It’s often
associated with medical conditions. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is most
likely to afflict someone who spends many hours every day typing on
our computers.

We get afflict from the Latin word affligere, meaning “to strike
down,” which is an old fashioned way of saying to get sick, or to have
a condition of some kind. You could argue that chronic indecision was
the main problem to afflict Hamlet, or that saying "um," "like," and
"you know" are speech tics that afflict teens.

The project will provide the scientific basis of a solution for
many of the problems of programming error that afflict all
builders and users of software today.
* incurred :satellite:
[2018-01-30 Tue 17:03]

To incur is to get or receive — and usually it's something you brought
upon yourself. If you don't pay your credit card bills on time, you'll
likely incur lots of fees and some serious debt.

Generally, when you incur something, that something is undesirable.
You can incur penalties, expenses, a parking ticket, or a friend’s
wrath, for example. But it's pretty unlikely that you'd incur free
tickets to the World Series. Frederick Douglass once famously said, “I
prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the
ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and to incur my own
abhorrence."

Over half the cost is incurred by the users.
* Steady :satellite:
[2018-01-30 Tue 17:11]

The adjective steady describes something that is firmly fixed in
position. If you have to climb up on your roof, you definitely want to
have a steady ladder. Otherwise, you risk ending up in the bushes
instead of on the roof.

The adjective steady can also describe something that isn't going to
fluctuate wildly. If you have a steady income from a salary, you bring
in approximately the same amount of money each month. If you are paid
on commission, on the other hand, you may make Midas look poor in some
months and beggars look rich in others. As a verb, to steady means "to
make something steady" (big surprise): You can steady a wobbly table
by sticking a matchbook under its shortest leg, or you could steady a
nervous dog with a reassuring pat.

Steady progress towards the answers is emerging from the normal
scientific processes of competitive research and open
publication.
* scarcest :satellite:
[2018-01-30 Tue 17:14]

If something is scarce, there isn't much of it around. Crops are
scarce after a long drought, or you might find babysitters scarce if
your kids are a nightmare to watch.

Scarce, meaning “restricted in quantity,” can oddly be traced back to
the same Latin word that spawned the word "excerpt." Use the word
scarce when you want to say that something is hard to find or
practically missing. When you know you’re about to be asked to do
something unpleasant, like wash the dishes or take out the trash, go
ahead and “make yourself scarce,” which means to be elusive or get out
of there fast.

their enthusiasm and talent will always be our scarcest
scientific resource.
* envisage :satellite:
[2018-01-31 Wed 09:34]

Martin Luther King Jr. envisaged a time when black and white Americans
would no longer be segregated by race. To envisage is to imagine
something that does not yet exist.

The words envisage and envision share the same Latin root meaning to
see. Both words are very similar in meaning but do have slight shades
of difference. If you envision something happening, you can see it
happening in your mind. I'm sure you can envision yourself graduating
from high school! If you envisage something, you can imagine it, but
not necessarily see it. You can envisage world peace, but it may be
harder to envision it.

We envisage that the Grand Challenge project will deliver its
testable and measurable scientific results within twenty years.
* infeasible :satellite:
[2018-01-31 Wed 10:02]

Infeasible things are impossible, or too complicated to actually be
done. Your idea of staging a city-wide game of Capture the Flag is
probably infeasible.

After several frustrating attempts at walking your cat around the
neighborhood on a leash, you might finally decide the idea is
infeasible — it's just not going to work the way you imagined. When
something is feasible, it's entirely possible. Feasible comes from the
Old French faisable, "that may be done," from the Latin root facere,
"to make or do." When you add the "not" prefix in-, you get
infeasible.

According to the principles of quantum physics, quantum computers
should be able to perform computations that are infeasible on
today’s computers.
* ascertaining :satellite:
[2018-01-31 Wed 10:35]

Ascertain is a verb that means to find out something. You might have
to go to the bank to ascertain if there is any money in your account.

This is a formal word that often applies to discovering the facts or
truth about something through examination or experimentation.
Information that is ascertained is certain beyond a doubt. If you want
a less formal synonym, use discover.

Proof is a method for ascertaining the truth.
* establishing :satellite:
[2018-01-31 Wed 10:38]

To establish something means to begin it or bring it about. If you
want everyone in your family to bring you chocolate every evening, you
can establish a “Chocolates for Me” policy requiring it.

Establish is related to stable through its Latin roots and has many
meanings, but all have the feel of building on a stable foundation.
Besides the meaning of setting a policy, establish can also mean to
prove one's value. You should establish yourself in a community before
you try to bring change to it. Similarly, if you like to debate
controversial issues, you'd best begin with facts that have been
established and are not open to question. If you have a lot of money
and want to build up your community, you can establish, or found, a
school or library there.

Proof is a method for ascertaining (establishing, verifying) the truth.
* established :satellite:
[2018-02-01 Thu 09:35]

Something or someone well established is well known, totally trusted
and usually has a proven track record of success.

Becoming established doesn't happen overnight. You've got to put in
the time and effort to prove yourself, make connections and build a
good reputation. So it makes sense that this adjective is related to
the verb establish, which means to "create, set up, or prove."
Established is a handy word to know, especially when you're looking
for a dentist — you probably won't want to try Dr. Lovedrill until his
practice is more established.

Truth is established by jury or judges.
* proof :satellite:
[2018-02-01 Thu 09:35]

Proof is the evidence that shows something is true or valid. When you
show the logical steps that take you from your hypothesis that the
world is round to the conclusion that it is, you're formulating a
proof.

Photographic prints that haven't been touched up are also called
proofs, and that’s also what you call the first copy of a printed
text, before it's checked for errors and corrected. When you check a
text for errors, you're proofing. If your poker strategy is foolproof,
even somebody who knows nothing about poker — a poker fool, that is —
can’t get it wrong. Proof is a word you’ll see on bottles of alcohol,
too: 90-proof rum means it's 45% alcohol.

A mathematical proof is a verification of a proposition by chain
of logical deductions from a set of axioms.
* Predicate :satellite:
[2018-02-01 Thu 09:35]

The predicate is the part of a sentence that includes the verb and
verb phrase. The predicate of "The boys went to the zoo" is "went to
the zoo."

We change the pronunciation of this noun ("PRED-uh-kit") when we turn
it into a verb ("PRED-uh-kate"). The verb predicate means to require
something as a condition of something else, and we use this term
mostly in connection with logic, mathematics, or rhetoric. To
predicate your argument on certain facts is to use those facts as
evidence.

Predicate is a proposition whos truth demends on value of
variable.
* proposition :satellite:
[2018-02-01 Thu 10:32]

A proposition is a proposed plan of action, a detailed suggestion. You
might consider your friend's suggestion to set up a neighborhood
snow-shoveling business after the blizzard a winning proposition.

The noun proposition means something presented for consideration. In
some contexts, that something being offered is sexual. Therefore,
don't use the term proposition loosely. If you say that you made a
proposition to your teacher, people could misinterpret you. It's safer
to stick with suggestion.

* detrimental :satellite:
[2018-02-01 Thu 12:43]

Detrimental is a formal way of saying "harmful." Anything detrimental
hurts, hinders, or puts a damper on something. Detrimental things do
damage.

Have you ever heard "Smoking may be detrimental to your health" and
wondered what it meant? It means that smoking is bad for your health:
it's going to harm you in a bunch of ways. Detrimental is a more
official, formal way of talking about things that do harm. A dog who
likes digging holes can be detrimental to a garden. If you're writing
a paper and want to pick an alternative to harmful that sounds more
formal, detrimental is a great choice.

* tinge :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 10:53]

A tinge is a slight amount of something, especially a faint color. If
you wear SPF30 to the beach, you'll only come home with a tinge of
tan.

If a painting has just a tiny hint of orange, then it was a tinge of
orange. And you could say the painter tinged the picture with orange
hues. Outside of paint colors, a tinge can mean a small amount of just
about anything. Sometimes you hear about someone speaking with a tinge
of sadness. That means there's just a little bit sadness showing in
their words. A tinge will never bowl you over — it's always small and
subtle.

Given that, in modern usage, [giddy||volatile]
   describes someone silly and frivolous, it's interesting to know
   that the Old English source for this word has a slightly darker
   tinge: gidig means "insane" or "god-possessed."
* clogged :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 14:16]

Something that's clogged is blocked or stopped up. When your sink is
clogged, the soapy water can't flow down the drain.

If your gutters are clogged with leaves, rain water will simply flow
and drip over the edges, and if your arteries become clogged, you'll
be at a higher risk for having a heart attack. In both cases, the
clogged things need to be cleared or cleaned out in order to work
properly. Another way something can be clogged is to be clotted or
thickened: "I don't like this oatmeal because the pieces are all
clogged together."

He woke up with his eyes watering, and his nose so clogged that

* ablation :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 14:17]

An ablation is removing a body part, organ, or tissue surgically. If a
doctor takes out one of your kidneys, that's an ablation.

This Latinate noun from the little-used verb ablate refers to the
surgical removal of tissue from someone's body. This is a general term
that applies to the surgical removal of any part of the patient's
body. If an oncologist is removing a cancerous growth, that's an
ablation. If a limb is being amputated, that's an ablation. If a
dentist pulls out a tooth, that's an ablation. The other kind of
ablation is also a reduction: the melting of glaciers.

It may well turn out that the factor limiting high-velocity
interstellar flight will not be energy but ablation of the shield
mass by dust grains, and evaporation by protons.
* appreciable :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 14:18]

Movie theater popcorn tastes much better than microwave popcorn. The
difference between them is appreciable — that is, you notice it.

A good way to remember appreciable is to think of the related word
appreciate. You appreciate the quality of the popcorn at the movie
theater because it is significantly better than what you make at home.
Of course, appreciable differences aren't always appreciated. There
has been an appreciable improvement in the quality of televisions in
the last 20 years, but if you've got an old TV, that isn't much
comfort.

Tenuous though that is, an object moving through it at sixty
thousand kilometres a second or more hits a surprising amount of
material - and at that velocity even a single hydrogen atom can
do appreciable damage.
* Tenuous :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:23]

If something is tenuous it's thin, either literally or metaphorically.
If you try to learn a complicated mathematical concept by cramming for
45 minutes, you will have a tenuous grasp of that concept, at best.

Tenuous comes from the Latin word tenuis, for thin, and is related to
our word tender. Something can be physically tenuous, like a spiderweb
or ice on a pond. We more often use it in a metaphorical sense, to
talk about weak ideas. Tenuous arguments won't win any debate
tournaments. Synonyms for tenuous, also used physically or
metaphorically, are flimsy and shaky.

[2018-02-02 Fri 15:25]

If you're accustomed to something, you're used to it. Being accustomed
has to do with habits and lifestyle.

Anything you're accustomed to is a regular thing for you. A rich
person is probably accustomed to fancy clothes, expensive food, and
beautiful houses. A football player is accustomed to getting tackled
and tackling other people. Office workers get accustomed to filling
out forms and fixing the copy machine. We can also say an accustomed
thing is a usual, customary thing. When you think of the word
accustomed, think "nothing new here."

* subdued :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:28]

The adjective subdued refers to something, like a sound, that has a
lowered intensity. Your loud conversation with a friend in the back of
the classroom is likely to become subdued when the teacher passes out
the exams.

The word subdued is related to the Latin word, subdere, which means
"to subtract from." Something that is subdued has lost some of its
strength or intensity. Subdued lighting might create a romantic mood
at a restaurant. And a subdued child is one who is no longer having a
fit. A subdued economy is probably pretty sluggish.

* fussed :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:29]

If you are making a fuss, settle down! A fuss is a state of
excitement, and it's usually about something not worth worrying or
"fussing" about.

Most fusses are types of commotion. If someone makes a fuss, they're
overexcited and in a tizzy over something, like someone who can't stop
asking questions. Another fuss is angrier: you might say "What's the
fuss?" if you hear two people yelling at each other. A fuss is also
any kind of hubbub or whirlwind of activity, like a huge crowd
swarming toward a sale. Parents tend to fuss over their children.
Someone who fusses is worrying too much.

* apprehension :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:31]

Apprehension is fear or anxiety about something – you might feel
apprehension about an upcoming test. Apprehension is also the capture
of a criminal, when they get apprehended, or caught. It can mean
“understand an idea” too. Get it?

Given the crook's record of evading arrest, the chief had real
apprehensions about being able to catch him. Eventually though, she
activated the whole police force in an effort to ensure the crook's
apprehension. And it paid off! They caught him red-handed. But it
wasn't until he saw the video of the crime in progress that the guy
apprehended just how much trouble he was in. It was that apprehension
that led him to make a deal with the district attorney.

I fully understand your - ah - concern, but there's no need to
feel the slightest apprehension.
* concern :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:32]

Concern is both a noun and a verb. As a noun it's something that you
find particularly important. If you love pizza, getting the crust just
so is a major concern during your pizza party.

Concern can also be something or someone that makes you upset or
anxious, like your concern over the quality of the pizza crust. It can
be a feeling of sympathy, like when your mom expresses concern over
your obsession with pizza crust. As a verb, concern means to be
relevant to something. Your main goal today may concern studying for
your math test. Concern can also describe worry. When you stay out
past curfew, your mom will be concerned.

I fully understand your - ah - concern, but there's no need to

[2018-02-02 Fri 15:35]

An orifice is an opening or a hole, most often in the body, such as
your mouth or your nostril.

We most often use orifice to describe a natural opening in our bodies,
but it can an opening into any cavity, such as a hollowed out tree
trunk, or the vent of a heating system. Other definitions of orifice
include a type of nozzle used in plumbing applications and a plate
used to measure the flow of liquid.

Those jet orifices are ridiculously small - if that's what they
are.
* revealed :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:37]

When you make something visible or make it public information, you
reveal it. For example, if you want to plan a picnic, wait until
forecasters reveal the weather that is predicted.

The verb reveal comes from the Latin word revelare meaning "unveil,"
like when you take off your hat to reveal your new haircut, or when
you reveal information about your past that will shock or amuse your
friends. You might also be familiar with the noun form of reveal,
makeover show-speak for the moment viewers see the newly renovated
room or someone's dramatic new look, as in saving the reveal for the
end of the show so people keep watching.

That there was much more to space than naive intuition suggested
was first revealed by the classic work of Lamb and Rutherford in
1947.
* stipulate :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:38]

To stipulate something means to demand that it be part of an
agreement. So when you make a contract or deal, you can stipulate that
a certain condition must be met.

Anytime you draw up a legal agreement, you can stipulate a requirement
that has to be met for that agreement to be complete. This stipulation
might put some sort of limit on the agreement. For example, if you run
a fencing company and offer a sale, you can stipulate that to get the
sale price, the fence must be ordered by a certain date. Your
customer, in turn, might stipulate that the work must be finished
before the ground freezes.

* solace :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:39]

If something eases your disappointment or grief, consider it a solace.
If you're sad, you might find solace in music or in talking to your
friends.

It is no surprise that consolation and solace are similar in meaning
as they share a root in the Latin verb sōlārī "to comfort." In fact,
solace and consolation are synonyms meaning relief from grief or
disappointment. When you go to sleepaway camp, your parents will miss
you, but they'll find solace in knowing that you are having fun.

Though I am still not sure why my
instincts revolt against it, I always refused to accept the false
solace of a dialogue with the dead.
* succumbed :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:40]

Use the verb succumb to say that someone yields to something they've
tried to fight off, such as despair, temptation, disease or injury.

If you succumb to cancer, it means you die of it. From this sentence
you can see that this verb is usually followed by the preposition to.
The Latin root is succumbere, from the prefix sub- "under" plus
-cumbere "to lie down."

Seductive is an adjective that describes the fascinating magnetic pull
that someone or something has, an attractive quality that tempts you
in some way.

A seductive person catches your eye and won’t let it go. The word
comes from the Latin seducere, meaning “draw aside.” When someone
draws your attention aside from whatever you’re doing, that is a
seductive person. Radio people often have seductive voices that lull
you to sleep, and stores put their most seductive items in the front
window in hopes that you’ll be tempted to come inside and buy them.

* torrent :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:41]

A torrent is a heavy rain, or the flooding or wildly-running streams
it causes, like the torrent that soaks everyone unlucky enough to be
out on the street at that moment.

Because the noun torrent literally means "rushing stream," it is often
describes fast-flowing water, like a rainstorm or creeks and rivers
that overflow their banks. But the word can also describe any sudden
inundation, like a deluge of words or thoughts, like when, in anger,
you unleash a torrent of emotional words on your friend. Like a
violent storm, you pour those words, not letting up in order to let
him or her explain the other side of the story.

Eight minutes after they had left the Sun, a tiny fraction of the

* hectic :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:42]

Things that are hectic tend to be happen quickly and all at once —
that's why a hectic day makes people nervous.

Think about a calm, beautiful island with the sun shining and nothing
to do but read a book. That kind of peacefulness is the opposite of
hectic. When things get hectic, people sometimes say things are
getting crazy or bananas: events are happening too fast for us to keep
up, so we tend to get agitated or even angry. Because there's so much
work to do, being a student is often a hectic job.

Such a velocity had been attained by robot probes - flashing

Incongruity means out of place — something that doesn't fit in its
location or situation. The art show patrons couldn't help but chuckle
at the incongruity of a toilet sitting in the middle of an exhibition
of Renaissance paintings.

An incongruity is very different from everything around it, to the
point of being inappropriate to the situation. A cat at a dog's
birthday party would be an incongruity, as would a pacifist at a
meeting of the War Lovers' Society. Incongruity is the idea that
something is incongruous, or inappropriate. A purple towel is an
incongruity in an all black-and-white bathroom.

* contrived :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:44]

If you see something that seems fake since it was too perfectly
planned out, call it contrived. If you can easily predict the final
minutes of a made-for-TV movie, then call it contrived.

The adjective contrived describes something that is artificially
planned, especially in an obvious way, so it comes across as faked or
forced. It's not just drama that can come off as contrived. Someone's
speech habits, wardrobe, or even personality can seem contrived.
Whenever someone appears as if he or she is "trying too hard," they
might seem contrived, or the opposite of "natural."

The first time the mayor arrived, Loren contrived to be in an
almost moribund state, but this tactic proved disastrous, as it
made it impossible for him to fend off some moist caresses.
* moribund :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:44]

Something that is moribund is almost dead, like a moribund economy
that has been stuck in a recession for years.

In Latin, mori means "to die." You probably recognize this root in
words like mortal, mortician, and mortuary. Moribund means "near
death," but it can also mean something that is coming to an end,
nearly obsolete, or stagnant. For example, as streaming videos over
the Internet becomes a more and more popular way to watch movies and
television shows, the DVD has become a moribund medium.

almost moribund state, but this tactic proved disastrous, as it

* perceptible :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:45]

Something perceptible is noticeable, even if just slightly. A
perceptible noise can be heard.

You perceive through your senses, and things that are perceptible can
be perceived; you can sense them. A flavor is perceptible if you can
taste it. A sound is perceptible if you can hear it. The opposite of
perceptible is imperceptible, for things that can't be noticed or
detected. If you notice a sound, sight, or change, then it must be
perceptible.

Perhaps it was just as well that their tides were barely
perceptible, the thought of five- and seven-day cycles clashing
discordantly together was so comically horrible that she could
not help smiling and immediately felt much better.
* preposterous :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:46]

To a vegetarian, the idea of eating a 52-ounce T-bone steak would seem
preposterous — absolutely absurd.

When the word preposterous was first used, it meant reversing the
normal order of things — putting what was last first, and vice versa.
Imagine putting on your underwear over your pants and you'll see that
there's a kind of absurdity in something that's backwards, which is
why preposterous came to mean "ridiculous." The word is often used as
part of an exclamation: a chef who is asked to cook with nothing but
jelly beans might exclaim, "That's preposterous!"

But in order to cancel that velocity at the end of the voyage,
the ship must start not with a million - but a preposterous
million, million tons of propellant.
* peered :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:48]

A peer is someone at your own level. If you are a 10th grader, other
high school students are your peers.

Peer comes from the Latin par which means equal. When you are on par
with someone, you are their peer. If kids your age are pressuring you
to do something you don't want to do, that's peer pressure. In the
sport of basketball, Michael Jordan was without peer, no one could
equal his talent. When he switched to baseball, he found himself to be
among peers again.

Brant shielded his eyes and peered around the edge, squinting
against the glare.
* peek :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:49]

When you peek, you take a quick glance at something. It's incredibly
tempting when you're little to peek at your birthday presents, but you
soon learn how disappointing it is to spoil the surprise.

A sneaky look at something is a peek. You might peek at someone if
you're shy or you don't want them to catch you looking. You can also
describe a glance at a part of something as "a peek" — like when you
take a peek at a napping child. Peek comes from piken, a 14th century
word meaning "look quickly and slyly." Until the 15th century, the
word peek was used interchangeably with keek and peep.

'Then we'll get out and peek around it.
* apparently :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:50]

Apparently is an adverb meaning "evidently" or "obviously." After his
sixth hot dog, you might say to your friend, "Well! Apparently
somebody was hungry!"

While apparently can mean "plainly" — like, duh — it can also mean
"seemingly," which is almost "evidently" or "obviously," but not
quite. There's a certain amount of guessing involved, based on
appearances. The park ranger who shows up in the morning to examine
the path of destruction through your campsite might say that it was
"apparently the work of a hungry bear," not because he's totally sure,
but because it definitely looks like something the bears around here
would do.

Spilling round the edges of the still-untarnished cylinder was a
flood of light, apparently from a single brilliant source.
* reverently :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:51]

Doing something reverently means doing it in a solemn, respectful way.
A restless crowd waiting to see the Pope might sit reverently when he
finally arrives.

The whole congregation prays reverently together when a minister leads
it in prayer. In fact, a church, mosque, or temple is the perfect
place to act reverently, but you probably do it in many other places
as well. Some fans stand reverently during the national anthem before
a baseball game. And if your favorite musician is playing a concert,
you might listen reverently, shushing anyone nearby who's talking. The
Latin root is revereri, "stand in awe of."

Then he said, almost reverently.
* ample :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:52]

Ample describes an abundance of something. An ample supply of apple
muffins at the bake sale is a good thing, as is ample legroom in your
new van, but you probably don't want your ample waistline spilling
over the top of your jeans.

Like amplify (crank up the volume), ample is from the Latin word
amplus, meaning "large or spacious" and has the word plus in it, like
plus-sized models. Ample can be enough or even too much of something.
It's great when there's ample parking or water for the hike, but there
are things that some people don't want more of, like extra pounds.
It's a cheeky insult to tell someone he or she has ample thighs, but
we'd all be happy if we had ample time and money.

But if Pasadena could be successfully colonized, there would be
ample time to send back the good news.
* decant :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:53]

The verb decant means "to pour." Kids moving water back and forth
between two cups, your dad pouring a bucket of soapy water in the
sink, or a wine expert emptying a bottle of wine into a fancy glass
container — all of them are decanting liquids.

When you decant, pronounced "dee-CANT," something by slowly pouring it
from one bottle to another, you may feel a little bit like a mad
scientist or an alchemist. That image would be appropriate, since
early on decant was used by alchemists to describe the process of
separating a liquid from a sediment by careful pouring. Today, wine
lovers do just that — decanting wine to avoid any solid bits — but
pouring any liquid can be described as decanting.

It would be useless - indeed, cruel - to decant naked, ignorant
children on to worlds as unfriendly as the Sahara or the
Antarctic.
* hovering :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:55]

A hover craft flies low over the ground or water — it hovers. Hover
can also mean waver. Think of someone that can’t decide exactly where
to land.

To help remember the meaning of hover, think of it as containing the
preposition over: things that hover hang over. A temperature can hover
around forty degrees, a grade in a class can hover around a B.

According to the central computer, the network was now hovering
around its normal ninety-five per cent serviceability, and Mayor
Waldron would gladly have settled for less.
* condescended :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:56]

A snooty waiter might condescend to serve you dinner at a fancy
restaurant, meaning that he'd consider himself far too important to
carry out the mundane task of delivering your hamburger and fries.

You might have noticed that condescend contains the word descend,
meaning to move down from a higher place. You can think of condescend
as lowering yourself to do a task that you feel is far beneath you.
Kings and queens would never condescend to do their own laundry at the
palace, for example. If they even knew how to do the laundry, you can
be sure they'd do it in a condescending, or superior, way to let
everyone know that housework is no task for a monarch.

She did not enjoy being condescended to by someone who was not
really very intelligent, though undoubtedly shrewd - or perhaps
cunning was the better word.
* shrewd :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:57]

If you are shrewd in your spending, you can make a small salary go a
long way. Use the adjective shrewd to describe a person or thing that
is smart or clever in a practical sort of way.

The word shrewd is from a Middle English adjective formed from the
noun schrewe "an evil person, a villain." This Middle English noun is
an earlier form of our modern English word shrew. So shrewd and shrew
are related to each other. Shrewd doesn't usually have a disapproving
or negative tone, but shrew certainly does.

She did not enjoy being condescended to by someone who was not
really very intelligent, though undoubtedly shrewd - or perhaps
cunning was the better word.
* obsolescence :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:59]

Fashion trends come and go, and often return after a time. But
gimmicky fads quickly fall into obsolescence, losing appeal and
falling out of sight — do you know anyone who still has a pet rock?

The word obsolescence is the noun form of the more common obsolete,
meaning "something no longer used." Both words stem from the Latin
obsolēscere, which means, logically enough, "to fall into disuse."
Your phone or your car may be designed for obsolescence, meaning they
are meant to stop working or go out of style so you'll buy a newer
model. More amusingly, TV personality Art Linkletter once commented,
"The four stages of man are infancy, childhood, adolescence, and
obsolescence.”

The Lassans had experimented cheerfully with most vices, but
planned obsolescence and conspicuous consumption were not among
them.
* vices :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 15:59]

A vice is a moral failing or a bad habit. Traditional examples of vice
include drinking alcohol, smoking tobacco, and gambling in card games.

In the United States, municipal police departments often have a bureau
dedicated to vice, manned by vice cops, whose job it is to fight crime
related to alcohol, drugs, and gambling. But anything can be a vice,
as long as there's someone out there who views it as bad behavior or a
moral weakness. You might say, casually, "I don't drink, smoke, or
gamble. Chocolate ice cream is my vice." Or driving over the speed
limit. Or intentionally failing to sort your recycling.

The Lassans had experimented cheerfully with most vices, but
planned obsolescence and conspicuous consumption were not among
them.
* conspicuous :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 16:00]

Keep your eye on the adjective conspicuous for something that stands
out so much you notice it right away — like that zit in the center of
your friend's forehead.

Conspicuous comes from the adjectival form of the Latin verb,
conspicere, meaning "to look at." Conspicuous can mean either very
obvious to the eye (like something that is conspicuous from a
distance) or attracting attention (like conspicuous consumption). If
you are doing something wrong, it's wise not to be conspicuous about
it!

The Lassans had experimented cheerfully with most vices, but
planned obsolescence and conspicuous consumption were not among
them.
* tolling :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 16:01]

A toll is a payment made for something. To drive on some highways,
drivers have to pay a toll when they exit.

Toll comes from the Greek word for "tax," telos. When a fee is charged
for the privilege of driving on a road or crossing a bridge, it's
called a toll. Another kind of toll is the charge to make a long
distance telephone call. Occasionally, toll refers to a different kind
of cost — a loss of human life: the human toll of an earthquake or
war. Finally, there's the toll, or deep ringing sound, of a bell.

Tocsin No one heard the first tolling of Earth's funeral bell -
not even the scientists who made the fatal discovery, far
underground, in an abandoned Colorado gold mine.
* evaded :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 16:02]

When you evade something, you escape it. You could evade a police
chase by slipping into a secret alley, or you could evade your
mother's questions about the missing cookies by slipping into another
topic.

Other things people like to evade? Death. Taxes. Creepy ex-boyfriends.
The verb evade comes from Latin roots ex ("away) and vadere ("to
walk"), meaning literally "to walk away or to escape." Definitely what
you want to do with creepy ex-boyfriends.

However many stars and planets they encountered, most of them

* reprimand :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 16:03]

If you're reprimanded, someone in authority speaks to you in an angry
way because you've done something wrong. Or you might reprimand your
dog if he steals your hot dog.

The House of Representatives has a couple of ways to punish naughty
members. One way is to reprimand them by voting to express
disapproval. In 2009, Representative Joe Wilson was reprimanded after
his outburst of "You lie!" during President Obama's speech. In the
halls of Congress, this is considered "unparliamentary language," but
if you yell at your congressman, that's okay.

Though he was driving with his usual effortless skill, Brant was
still smouldering slightly from the mayor's reprimand.
* conceivably :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 16:04]

Use the adverb conceivably when you're talking about something that is
believable or possible. You could say, for example, that you'll
conceivably still be on time to work after oversleeping, especially if
you skip breakfast.

You might tell your sister that you could conceivably go on every
single ride at the state fair in an hour, if you move quickly and
don't stop to eat fried dough. You could also say that your favorite
baseball team might conceivably win the World Series next year.
Conceivably comes from its adjective form, conceivable, and both words
are rooted in the Latin concipere, which means "take in, hold, or
grasp" and also "become pregnant."

He recalled that, a few years ago, there had been a move to

* reverie :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 16:05]

If you're relaxing on the beach, dreaming of how you will never have
to get up and go back to work, you're engaged in a reverie, or
pleasant daydream.

There's nothing wrong with reverie, but if you follow its path into
English, you'll see how closely it is connected to madness. The noun
is from French rêverie, from a Middle French word meaning "wild
speech, delirium," from rever "to roam, speak wildly." Middle French
rever is also the source of English rave, as in raving mad.

Brant had never even noticed the call, he had been too lost in a
reverie of his own.
* confident :satellite:
[2018-02-02 Fri 16:06]

If you're confident you are sure about something, someone, or
yourself. He was confident he could keep his balance and cross the
river on the skinny log, but he wasn't so confident that the log was
strong enough to hold him.

Confident is often a word of assurance. Someone may ask, "Are you sure
that's the right way to do it?" and then, just to be assured, they
might say, "So, you're confident that's the right wire to cut so the
bomb doesn't blow?" Being really sure of something or being sure of
yourself is being confident. "He held his head high, but not in an
arrogant or show-off way; he was just confident about who he was. He
liked himself."

[2018-02-06 Tue 10:21]

Stark means "complete or extreme," like the stark contrast between
your music taste — punk and weird metal — and your mom's, with all her
1950's doo-wop favorites.

In describing a place, stark means "providing no shelter or
sustenance." A barren desert or a room with no furniture or curtains
is stark. It can also mean "severe, stern, or austere," like the stark
beauty of the rocky cliffs in the west of Ireland. Stark can also be
used to mean "totally." If you are called stark, raving mad, there's
no question about it: you are acting completely crazy.

It must be made clear that one can still write code in Python

* commitments :satellite:
[2018-02-22 Thu 13:07]

Making a commitment involves dedicating yourself to something, like a
person or a cause. Before you make a commitment, think carefully. A
commitment obligates you to do something.

Some commitments are large, like marriage. When you take a job, you're
making a commitment to show up and do the job well, and your employer
makes a commitment to pay you. There are smaller commitments too. If
you said you'd meet a friend at six, that's a commitment — show up or
your friend will be mad. You also can speak of commitment as a
quality. Staying after school for a study group shows your commitment
to good grades.

It is a juggling act of various demands of study, social life,
employment, family, and personal interests and commitments with
the finiteness of time.
* compliance :satellite:
[2018-02-22 Thu 14:01]

Compliance is what you do when you try to fit standards set down by
someone else. A restaurant chef's compliance with a new sugar-free
menu might inspire even the pastry chefs to follow the recipes.

Plywood helps illustrate the "pli" in compliance, because if you've
ever stepped on a piece of plywood stretched across something, you've
felt how it gives underneath your feet. It has flexibility. Compliance
means being flexible or yielding and giving in to a situation or
order. "Pliant" is part of the word compliance, and it means yielding.
Agreeing or bending to something like a plan, rule, or direction is
compliance.

* The related process of reduction of time spent on
 non-priorities 
* Incentives to modify behavior to ensure compliance with
 time-related deadlines.
* triage :satellite:
[2018-02-22 Thu 14:02]

Grouping patients based on the severity of their injuries and the
likelihood of their survival is called triage. In a triage situation,
urgent cases are seen by doctors first, and non-life-threatening
emergencies go last.

You can also apply the sorting and prioritizing of triage to more
general situations. If you're overwhelmed with homework, you can
perform triage by organizing it into subjects and prioritizing
assignments based on their due dates. The word triage comes from the
French word trier meaning to sort. Although the medical sense is now
the most common, it wasn't used that way until World War One.

* "get organized" - the triage of paperwork and of tasks 
* "protecting one's time" by insulation, isolation and delegation

 psychological problems, e.g.
* emphasis :satellite:
[2018-02-22 Thu 14:03]

While the emphasis, or main focus, for walking a dog might be on
"answering the call of nature," the emphasis for the dog might be on
chasing squirrels.

If you say emphasis a little louder or with extra oomph in your
pronunciation, you are putting emphasis on the word. This emphasis
makes it clear that special attention, or emphasis, should be given to
the word. Now, having repeated emphasis so many times, the "s" sound
really stands out, sort of like in the word "stress." When you stress
a point, you put emphasis on something — it is the main thing, the
emphasis.

[2018-02-22 Thu 14:03]

Use the adjective tidy for something that is neat and clean. If your
desk were more tidy, you would be able to find your computer.

Tidy (or tidy up) also means “to clean up” and is also a noun for a
container for small objects, like scraps or sewing materials. These
senses of tidy have a formal or even old-fashioned note. (We’re more
likely to say clean, organize, or bin now in everyday conversation.) A
less informal use is as an adjective, meaning “large.” If you can put
the word tidy before your profit or the sum in your bank account, it’s
a good thing.

Credentials offer proof of a fact, or of qualifications. A driver’s
license, a doctor’s badge, or a diploma all count as credentials — as
long as they’re real!

One document can be a credential, but the word usually still gets
pluralized. Credentials prove that the bearer has gotten credit for
what he or she has done, as with a transcript, diploma, or certificate
proving a person’s activities. Your credentials allow you to get the
job, but your skills are what make you good at your job. Credentials
can also prove that you are allowed to do something or go somewhere,
like a badge that gets you past security.

Slumber means "sleep" — as a verb or noun. If you're a sound sleeper,
you might slumber peacefully right through a thunderstorm, your
slumber undisturbed.

To slumber is to sleep, sometimes specifically to sleep lightly or
doze. You can slumber in your bed, in your airplane seat, or through
your alarm in the morning. Slumber can also describe a peacefulness,
like your quiet street that seems to slumber early in the morning. The
phrase slumber party was first used in the 1940s to mean a gathering
held at night, that usually involves very little slumbering.

Something that's full of little lumps and bits is chunky. Some people

smooth and creamy.

Some kinds of soup are chunky, with hunks of potato and pieces of
broccoli, and you can also make a chunky spaghetti sauce that's full
of tomato bits. When a person is described as chunky, it means they're
dense and thick-bodied, and sometimes quite muscular. Chunky is an

To soothe is to relieve or to bring comfort. If the pounding in your

two to soothe your headache.

Soothing is meant to make you feel better, both physically and
emotionally. Spend too many hours on the beach without sunblock?
You'll need some aloe to soothe that sunburn. Had a bad breakup with a

[2018-03-11 Sun 11:18]

When your essay about French cooking starts describing a childhood
trip to Disneyland, it's taken a digression — it's strayed from the
main topic.

"But I digress" is a phrase often used by people when they realize
they're no longer "on-topic." A digression is like a tangent, only
digression often describes speech patterns, whereas tangent comes to
us from mathematics. Another trick to remembering the meaning of
digression is its relationship to the word progression. A progression
is a series of ideas which proceeds in the same direction; a
digression, logically enough, is an idea that goes off in another
direction.

I apologize for this digression but let's take a moment to talk

A pageant is an elaborate show or parade that usually depicts a
historical or religious event, although these days more people know
them as Miss America-type beauty contests.

Pageants aren't just for beauty queens — any richly decorated
spectacle or ceremony could be considered a pageant. Around Christmas
time, many Christian churches put on pageants that reenact the birth
of Jesus. The Carnival parades in Brazil represent another type of
pageant. And if your school organized a show where students had to act
out famous moments in history? That would be a pageant, too.

* spurt :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:40]

Things that spurt gush, stream, or flow rapidly. If you laugh too hard
while drinking a Coke, soda might spurt out of your nose. Ouch!

Spurt is also a noun: "A spurt of water erupted from the hole in the
water balloon before she had a chance to throw it." Though a jet of
liquid is usually what spurts, the word is also used for quick bursts
of speed, like a race car that spurts forward suddenly, winning at the
last second. The origin of spurt isn't certain, but it may be related
to the German spürzen, "to spit" and sprützen, "to squirt."

A salvo is when troops fire their guns all at the same time. A salvo
of shots might signal the beginning of a military battle.

Another word for the gunfire kind of salvo is a "volley." Military
planners have used salvos as a way to overwhelm an opposing army,
including during engagements between battleships and tanks. You can
also use salvo in a more figurative way, describing a verbal barrage
or attack: "Her direct, almost rude questions were seen as the opening
salvo in the battle between the two political candidates."

Lank can describe grass that is long, hair that is limp, and people
who are tall and thin.

From the Old English hlanc (which is fun to say out loud), meaning
loose and empty, lank is an adjective used to describe plant life
which is long and slender, hair that hangs long and limp, and people
who are long and slim. So you might hire a lank basketball player with
lank hair to cut the grass when it’s lank. Or you might cut it
yourself.

Mauve is a paler tone of the color purple, and for some strange reason
a beloved color for mothers of the bride.

Mauve is often considered a somewhat wishy-washy color, inoffensive
and bland. After all, the American novelist Alice Walker didn't
entitle her great 1982 novel about black women's' lives in the
American South The Color Mauve; she called it The Color Purple — far
more suggestive of the powerful, violence-soaked drama it is.

Gauze is a loosely woven, almost translucent fabric that's used to
bandage wounds. If you get a bad burn, a doctor might clean it and
cover it with gauze.

In medicine, gauze has several uses. Sterile gauze is usually kept in
a sealed package, to ensure that it's perfectly clean. It can be used
to clean cuts, scrapes, and burns, and also acts as a large bandage.
There is also a non-medical fabric called gauze that's used in light,
warm-weather clothing. The word's origin is mysterious — one guess
traces it to the Arabic gazz, or "raw silk."

among the long grass clumps in the olive-groves, where the crane-flies' unsteady flight
seemed to cover the ground with a drifting curtain of gauze.
* trifle :satellite:

A trifle is something that's totally unimportant. If your friend is
freaking out over which poster to buy and you call her dilemma a
trifle, you're saying she shouldn't get so worked up over nothing.

Trifle comes from the Middle English trufle, meaning "fraud, joke,
trick." You'll usually hear it used to mean "insignificant, trivial."
If you write a little ditty to sing at a birthday party, you could say
it's just a trifle. As a verb, trifle means "toy with, waste." If you
play with someone's feelings without seriously meaning anything, you
are trifling with his affection. Trifle is also a sweet, sticky cake.
Don't trifle the day away dreaming about trifle. Make some!

They sat there blinking,
and then would suddenly snap at a passing crane-fly; sitting back, looking a trifle
embarrassed, they stuffed the trailing ends of wing and leg into their great mouths with
the aid of their thumbs.
* soot :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:48]

The powdery black stuff that's sometimes created when fuel burns is
called soot. A chimney sweep's job is to clean all the soot and ash
from inside a chimney.

Soot is mostly made of carbon, and it forms when matter burns
incompletely. Engines, burning coal, and house fires are all sources
of soot, and soot is a major contributor to air pollution around the
world. It's dangerous for people to breathe too much soot into their
lungs. Soot comes from a Germanic root that literally means "what
settles."

The owls appeared now, drifting from tree to tree as silently as flakes of soot,
hooting in astonishment as the moon rose higher and higher, turning to pink, then gold,
and finally riding in a nest of stars, like a silver bubble.
* interminable :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:50]

Use interminable to describe something that has or seems to have no
end. Your math class. Your sister's violin recital. A babysitting job
where five kids are going through your purse and the parents didn't
leave a number.

Something that is interminable is often boring, annoying, or hard to
bear, such as an interminable noise. A near synonym is incessant,
which also refers to something unpleasant that continues without
stopping. It descends from the Latin prefix in- "not," terminare "to
end," and the suffix -abilis "able to." Latin terminare is also the
source of the English verb terminate "to end" and the corresponding
noun termination "an act of ending something."

At first the lessons were painful to an extreme: interminable
wrestling with fractions and percentages, geological strata and warm currents, nouns,
verbs, and adverbs.
* extricating :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:55]

If you need to be untangled, set free or otherwise released from
something or someone, you need to be extricated.

Extricate is a mixture of the prefix ex, which means "out" or "out
of," and the Latin word tricae, which means "hindrances." So to
extricate is to get out of what's hindering you. But it's not always
so simple. You just try and extricate yourself from the loving death
grip of a grandma who hasn't seen you in awhile!

Sometimes these
climaxes were so complicated and fraught with danger that I had great difficulty in
extricating the family intact on the following day.
* protruding :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:55]

Something protruding is sticking out. When you're playing hide and
seek, be sure your whole body is under the bed — a protruding arm or
leg will give away your hiding spot.

The part sticking out of an otherwise flat surface can be described as
protruding. If a display is protruding from a storefront, you have to
walk around it. If you have a big, red zit protruding from your
forehead, you should probably see a dermatologist. And if you look up
the mountainside and see rocks protruding, look out! Protruding rocks
tend to fall down, which could put a damper on the hike.

While I was at work on my
masterpiece, breathing heavily, tongue protruding, breaking off for discussions with
Roger on the finer points of the plot, Peter and Margo would take a stroll in the sunken
garden to look at the flowers.
* conscience :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:56]

A conscience is a built-in sense of what's right and what's wrong.
That sick feeling in your stomach after you meanly told your younger
brother the truth about Santa Claus? That might be your conscience
bothering you.

The word conscience contains the word science, which comes from the
Latin word scientia, meaning "to know" or "knowledge." You can think
of your conscience as your knowledge of yourself, especially when it
comes to your own morals, or your feelings about right and wrong.
Pangs of conscience, which feel like an uncomfortable inner voice, are
helpful when you're trying to decide the right thing to do in a
particular situation.

Occasionally, in the early days, Peter suffered from sudden spasms of conscience, my
epic would be relegated to a drawer, and we would pore over mathematical problems.
* relegated :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:57]

Relegate means assign to a lower position. If the quarterback of the
football team stops making decent throws he might be relegated to the
position of benchwarmer, while another kid is given the chance to
play.

Relegate rhymes with delegate––both words derive from the Latin legare
"send." Relegate means to send someone down in rank. Delegate means to
send someone in your place to complete a task. In the workplace,
managers who can't figure out how to delegate may get relegated to a
lesser rank.

* pore :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 14:57]

That trickle of sweat didn't just miraculously appear — it was
secreted out of a pore, a really tiny opening on the surface of your
skin.

When used as a noun, pore means any tiny hole or opening that allows
the passage of liquid. In humans, pores are the little holes that
bring us such pleasures as armpit sweat and, when clogged, pimples.
But when used as a verb, to pore means to concentrate your attention
on or devote hours of focus to something: like poring over the
overwhelming choices in the antiperspirant aisle.

epic would be relegated to a drawer, and we would pore over mathematical problems.
* slab :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 15:00]

A slab is a great big thick piece of something. Your backyard patio,
for example, might be made of a huge slab of concrete.

A sidewalk is often composed of one cement slab after another — these
are sometimes called paving slabs. You could refer to large pieces of
stone or wood as slabs too. Even your lunch might be a slab, if it's a
thick hunk of cheesy pizza or a huge slab of bread slathered with
peanut butter. The origins of the word slab are unknown, though we do
know it's been around since the thirteenth century.

The walls were sparsely, but tastefully, decorated with a slab slate
containing the fossilized remains of a fish, a photograph of myself shaking hands with a
chimpanzee, and a stuffed bat.
* slate :satellite:
[2018-03-12 Mon 15:01]

Slate is a type of gray metamorphic rock that is made up of quartz and
other minerals. The rock can be split into thin layers and the slate
used for things like roofing tiles.

In the past when paper was expensive, schoolchildren used slates to do
their school work. These were usually made of actual slate rock.
Students could practice their writing on the slate with a slate
pencil. When they were done, the slate could be erased, which gave
rise to the term "clean slate." If you've done things in the past you
aren't proud of, you may hope to start over with a clean slate.
