- Note taken on [2024-05-14 Tue 10:54] \\
  The difference between Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevOps
  lies in their primary focus and responsibilities within an
  organization:
  
  1. Focus:
     - DevOps: DevOps primarily focuses on software development and
       deployment processes, aiming to bridge the gap between
       development and operations teams to enhance collaboration and
       streamline the software delivery lifecycle[1][5].
     - SRE: SRE's main focus is on the reliability, scalability, and
       availability of systems. SRE teams work to ensure continuous
       functionality, automate maintenance tasks, and keep applications
       running smoothly[1][5].
  
  2. Responsibilities:
     - DevOps: DevOps teams are responsible for software
       development, deployment, and ensuring the quality and reliability
       of the end product. They work on continuous integration,
       continuous delivery, automation, and collaboration between
       different teams involved in the software delivery process[1][5].
     - SRE: SRE teams deal with operational problems such as
       production failures, infrastructure issues, security, and
       monitoring. They focus on maintaining uptime, optimizing
       performance, and ensuring system reliability. SREs also conduct
       incident response, post-incident reviews, and work on bug
       reporting related to infrastructure issues[1][5].
  
  3. Tools:
     - DevOps: DevOps commonly uses tools like Jenkins, JIRA,
       Splunk, GitHub, and integrated development environments (IDEs)
       for development, continuous integration, change management, and
       log monitoring[1].
     - SRE: SRE teams utilize tools like Prometheus, Grafana,
       incident alert tools (OP5, PageDuty, xMatters), Ansible, Puppet,
       Chef, Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP,
       Azure for monitoring, visualization, incident management,
       automation, and container orchestration[1].
  
  4. Measurement Metrics:
     - DevOps: DevOps teams typically measure metrics like
       deployment frequency and deployment failure rate to assess
       performance and efficiency in software delivery[1].
     - SRE: SRE teams focus on metrics such as Error Budgets,
       Service Level Objectives (SLOs), Service Level Indicators (SLIs),
       and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to monitor reliability,
       uptime, and robustness of systems[1].
  
  In summary, while both SRE and DevOps share common goals of enhancing
  reliability, efficiency, and collaboration within IT operations, they
  differ in their primary focus, responsibilities, tools used, and
  measurement metrics, catering to distinct aspects of software
  development, deployment, and system maintenance within an
  organization[1][5].
