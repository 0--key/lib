- Note taken on [2024-05-14 Tue 10:54] \\
  The difference between Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevOps
  lies in their primary focus and responsibilities within an
  organization:
  
  1. Focus:
     - DevOps: DevOps primarily focuses on software development and
       deployment processes, aiming to bridge the gap between
       development and operations teams to enhance collaboration and
       streamline the software delivery lifecycle[1][5].
     - SRE: SRE's main focus is on the reliability, scalability, and
       availability of systems. SRE teams work to ensure continuous
       functionality, automate maintenance tasks, and keep applications
       running smoothly[1][5].
  
  2. Responsibilities:
     - DevOps: DevOps teams are responsible for software
       development, deployment, and ensuring the quality and reliability
       of the end product. They work on continuous integration,
       continuous delivery, automation, and collaboration between
       different teams involved in the software delivery process[1][5].
     - SRE: SRE teams deal with operational problems such as
       production failures, infrastructure issues, security, and
       monitoring. They focus on maintaining uptime, optimizing
       performance, and ensuring system reliability. SREs also conduct
       incident response, post-incident reviews, and work on bug
       reporting related to infrastructure issues[1][5].
  
  3. Tools:
     - DevOps: DevOps commonly uses tools like Jenkins, JIRA,
       Splunk, GitHub, and integrated development environments (IDEs)
       for development, continuous integration, change management, and
       log monitoring[1].
     - SRE: SRE teams utilize tools like Prometheus, Grafana,
       incident alert tools (OP5, PageDuty, xMatters), Ansible, Puppet,
       Chef, Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP,
       Azure for monitoring, visualization, incident management,
       automation, and container orchestration[1].
  
  4. Measurement Metrics:
     - DevOps: DevOps teams typically measure metrics like
       deployment frequency and deployment failure rate to assess
       performance and efficiency in software delivery[1].
     - SRE: SRE teams focus on metrics such as Error Budgets,
       Service Level Objectives (SLOs), Service Level Indicators (SLIs),
       and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to monitor reliability,
       uptime, and robustness of systems[1].
  
  In summary, while both SRE and DevOps share common goals of enhancing
  reliability, efficiency, and collaboration within IT operations, they
  differ in their primary focus, responsibilities, tools used, and
  measurement metrics, catering to distinct aspects of software
  development, deployment, and system maintenance within an
  organization[1][5].

** RETARD 3 months in the future /smart/ shift
SCHEDULED: <2024-07-16 Tue>
- Note taken on [2023-09-21 Thu 19:32] \\
  It is possible to bulk-scatter task across several weeks in the near
  future. So it might be reasonable to switch all postponed tasks in
  to DELAY set and:

  - Split all them into 3 or 4 groups of tasks:
    - Next week;
    - Next month;
    - Next 3 months.

** RAW [#C] Large Language Model
SCHEDULED: <2024-05-28 Tue>
- Note taken on [2024-05-13 Mon 12:14] \\
  A large language model (LLM) is a deep learning algorithm that can
  perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These
  models use transformer models and are trained using massive datasets,
  which enables them to recognize, translate, predict, or generate text
  or other content[1]. They are also referred to as neural networks
  (NNs), which are computing systems inspired by the human brain[1].
  
  *Transformer Model*
  -------------------
  
  A transformer model is the most common architecture of a large
  language model. It consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder
  processes the input by tokenizing it, and then simultaneously
  conducting mathematical equations to discover relationships between
  tokens. This enables the computer to see the patterns a human would
  see were it given the same query[1].
  
  *How LLMs Work*
  ----------------
  
  LLMs work by analyzing massive data sets of language. They are built
  on machine learning, specifically a type of neural network called a
  transformer model[4]. They use a type of machine learning called deep
  learning to understand how characters, words, and sentences function
  together[4]. Deep learning involves the probabilistic analysis of
  unstructured data, which eventually enables the deep learning model to
  recognize distinctions between pieces of content without human
  intervention[4].
  
  *Applications of LLMs*
  -------------------------
  
  LLMs have many practical applications, including:
  
  - Copywriting: LLMs can write original copy[2].
  - Knowledge base answering: LLMs can answer specific questions from
    information help in digital archives[2].
  - Text classification: LLMs can classify text with similar meanings or
    sentiments[2].
  - Code generation: LLMs are proficient in code generation from natural
    language prompts[2].
  - Text generation: LLMs can complete incomplete sentences, write
    product documentation, or write a short children's story[2].
  
  *Limitations and Challenges*
  -----------------------------
  
  LLMs face a variety of challenges, including:
  
  - Hallucinations: LLMs can produce an output that is false or does not match the user's intent[1].
  - Security: LLMs present important security risks when not managed or
    surveilled properly[1].
  - Bias: The data used to train language models will affect the outputs
    a given model produces[1].
  - Consent: LLMs are trained on trillions of datasets, some of which
    might not have been obtained consensually[1].
  - Scaling: It can be difficult and time- and resource-consuming to
    scale and maintain large language models[1].
  
  *Importance of LLMs*
  ---------------------
  
  LLMs are incredibly flexible and have the potential to disrupt content
  creation and the way people use search engines and virtual
  assistants[2]. They can perform completely different tasks such as
  answering questions, summarizing documents, translating languages, and
  completing sentences[2].

*** Install elpa-*.deb packages

They are tested with this particular ~Emacs~ version and seems to me
much appealing as a much resilient and safe to use altogether. Replace all elpa-stable packages by elpa-*.deb for more stable work
with =Debian=. So:



- first of all - configure packages in my session at the ~Dell~:
  - package has its ~.deb~ prototype:
    - install ~.deb~;
    - test it up:
  - package is unique at ~ELPA~ only:
    - move its folder to the ~site-lisp~ and recompile it there;
