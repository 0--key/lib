*** Foreword
    Distributed computational units design with data-driven bias.
    Based on Emacs text editor and free-distributed. 
*** Brief description
    In recent years there are a plenty of tools and technologies drastically
    simplified user's data generation. Nowadays it it a cool feature to have is
    to know your visitor's metadata. It's such natural to serves your master in
    a much useful way. And, in another side of this user data generation and perhaps
    alongside with it, there is a data size issue become to rule in charge.
*** Data Size
    It's a hard question to answer precisely. Because it's all about precision.
**** All data
     Strictly speaking it's a false impression. Data always less than you're expected.
     In most cases it is something around how to separate the wheat from
     the chaff. And separation is a primitive process, what about how to
     prepare the dough and cook a few cakes?
**** In a trusted state
     - It's checking before writing in DB.
     - It's integrity testing twice a day (week).
     - Garbage strategy is the last thing to do.
     - Well-composed data-sets are usually stable.
*** Preliminary statistical computation
    - Avg, Max, Min, Sqrt, Med, Sigma, 6Sigmas
    - For sorted various ways lists
    - In 3D
*** Additional model re-factoring
    It's a bit recursive task and in several cases it should be helpful
    to refocus your attention on a bit different kind of data (concept)
    honing (approving)
*** Data processing algorithm optimization
    Sometimes (and very often) the speed is significant. And, as it is
    necessary to do in real world - you'll train speed up. It's impossible
    to achieve any results in speed in ignore /practice/.
*** Data-Set deployment
    Locate your data separately, please.
