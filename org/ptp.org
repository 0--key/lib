    Binary Theory, also known as [boolean algebra], or [logic], was
    designed as an [aid] to reasoning, and we will use it to [reason]
    about computation.

    The expressions of Binary Theory are called [binary expressions].
    We call some binary expressions [theorems], and others
    [antitheorems].
