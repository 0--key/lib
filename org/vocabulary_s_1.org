   would evolve from meaning farmer into evildoer is a little

   noun
   1. the process of taking possession of a mortgaged property as a result of the mortgagor's failure to keep up mortgage payments.

   When a homeowner can't afford to pay her mortgage, she might face
   foreclosure, which is when a bank repossesses a borrower's house.

   A bank most often starts foreclosure proceedings against someone
   who's taken out a loan to buy a house when that person stops making
   monthly payments. The agreement a borrower makes when she gets a
   bank mortgage is that she'll pay a certain amount of money every
   month, and failing to do it means risking foreclosure. The word
   foreclosure comes from the Latin words fors, "out," and clore "to
   shut."

   If politicians in your state want to address the growing number of
   home [foreclosures], they might [amend] the state constitution to
   include restrictions intended to reduce [foreclosures].

   a fast-food joint.

   [Contempt] has nothing to do with the verb condemn, despite the
   similarity in sound and meaning; it is from Latin temnere "to
   despise," and if you despise someone, you have [contempt] for them.
   It's a harsh term and should be used with care; it's stronger than
   either disdain or scorn. It suggests you find someone or something
   utterly worthless. That food snob might say the words "Big Mac" or
   "Whopper" with a voice dripping in [contempt].

   When you do something [disdainfully], you do it with disapproval or

      "Without warning, another shot rings out, followed by a deep

   2. a low creaking or moaning sound made by an object or device under pressure.

   2. (of a thing) make a low creaking or moaning sound when pressure or weight is applied.
      "James slumped back into his chair, making it [groan] and bulge"

   A [groan] is a sound of pain or disapproval that doesn't consist of
   words, usually heard after homework is assigned or bad jokes are
   told.

   People [groan] for lots of reasons: headaches, stomachaches, traffic
   jams, and bad news are just a few [groan]-worthy things that can
   provoke that moaning, "uuugghhhhh" sound. If someone is complaining
   about something, you could say she's "moaning and [groan]ing." People
   like to moan and [groan] about the weather, politics, and just about
   everything else.

   That's probably why any good comedian will tell you that "a [pun] is
   a short quip followed by a long [groan]."

   A [quip] — a short, witty comment — can be pleasant, wise, or

   A [quip], often taken as a sign of cleverness, is a witty remark that
   sounds spur-of-the-moment. A successful [quip] must sound offhand, as
   though it were an afterthought, even if the speaker has been honing
   the statement for days. Dorothy Parker was a famous writer known for

   verb
   1. keep (someone) in official custody, typically for questioning about a crime or in politically sensitive situations.
      "she was [detain]ed without trial for two years"



   When you [detain] someone, you hold them back, slow them down, or stop
   them from moving on. If you are [detain]ed by the police, you may be
   late for the big football game, even if you were speeding to get
   there by the kickoff.

   There are lots of words that contain the root tain, like contain and
   retain. These come from Latin tenere, which means "to hold." [Detain]
   is specifically used when you're talking about holding someone so
   they can't go anywhere. It's often used in discussions involving the
   police who [detain] people who they think might be guilty. But you can
   use [detain], say, when you're explaining why you were late: "I was
   [detain]ed at the office by a conference call that wouldn't end.
   Sorry."

   "he was [detain]ed on charges of [blasphemy]"

   A [prop] is something you use as a support, like a broom that

   When you use a [prop], you can say you [prop] something, or [prop] it
   up: "Here, [prop] your blanket fort up with this chair." This handy
   word also means "a moveable object used on the set of a movie or

   The noun [disciple] comes from the Latin word discipulus, which
   means "student, learner, or follower." One of the earliest places
   [disciple] showed up was in the Bible, where it means "a follower
   of Jesus," sometimes specifically one of the twelve Apostles. It's
   still used that way in religious speech and writing, but it can
   also describe a serious, dedicated follower or student of a teacher
   or leader.

      "the author wanted to [portray] a new type of hero"

   When you paint a picture of someone, either in words or in paint,
   you [portray] them. Actors [portray] characters too.

   Whether you're talking about acting or another art form, the idea is
   the same: representing a person and bringing to light their most
   important qualities. To [portray] a person is to show who that person
   is, giving a sense of their personality or character. Often, famous
   people don't like how they're [portray]ed. For example, Presidents
   usually hate how they're [portray]ed in editorial cartoons. When you
   [portray] someone, you can be positive or negative, accurate or

   Certain films, books, magazines, and other forms of [entertainment]

   1. crude and offensive in a sexual way.
      "she began to gyrate to the music and sing a [lewd] song"

   [Lewd] remarks are sexually inappropriate. Personal and sexually
   explicit comments might be acceptable when said in private, but they
   are not all right when said to strangers in public.

   [Lewd] has to do with sexual behavior or remarks that are highly
   inappropriate or obscene, often because of what's done or said is in
   public or to someone who does not want that kind of attention. The
   couple who might make sexually suggestive jokes in private with each
   other would be completely out of place doing the same thing in the
   supermarket. What's more, committing a [lewd] act or making
   inappropriate comments is socially — and legally — unacceptable, and
   it can even land the perpetrator in jail.

   In the early 17th Century, the word [repulsive] simply meant something
   that repelled or "pushed away." For example, the like poles of two

   [repulsive] usually means disturbing and sickening. As manners guru

   1. an act or instance of erupting.
      "the [eruption] of Vesuvius"

   An [eruption] is an explosion of steam and lava from a volcano. This
   word is also used for other explosions, such as "an [eruption] of
   emotions."

   If there's an [eruption] of a volcano, you don't want to be anywhere
   near it. When a volcano erupts, it spews a huge amount of lava, ash,
   and steam into the air. If you were angry at a friend but held your
   tongue for a long time, then suddenly started yelling in anger,
   that's an [eruption] too. The sudden spreading of a disease could be
   called an [eruption]. [Eruption]s are quick, huge, explosive, and
   dangerous: they're never good news.

   What, I wondered, could be the cause of this sudden [eruption]?

   1. a general view, examination, or description of someone or something.
      "the author provides a [survey] of the relevant literature"
   2. an act of [survey]ing an area of land.

   1. (of a person or their eyes) look carefully and thoroughly at (someone or something), especially so as to appraise them.

   2. examine and record the area and features of (an area of land) so as to construct a map, plan, or description.
      "he [survey]ed the coasts of New Zealand"

   The verb [survey] means to look something over. When you buy your
   first home, it's a pleasure to stand on the porch and [survey] your
   property.

   [Survey] has several meanings, all of which come from Medieval Latin
   and Anglo words for looking over. As a noun, [survey] can mean a
   detailed study of something, but it also means a short summary with
   a broad view. A [survey] course gives an overview of a particular
   subject area, but doesn't make you an expert. [Survey] is also a verb.
   If you [survey] an area hit by an earthquake, you look closely at it
   to measure the damage.

   [Bleary] almost always describes a person's eyes, although you can

   verb
   1. hit (someone or something) heavily, especially with the fist or
      a blunt implement. "Holman [thump]ed the desk with his hand"

   A [thump] is a hard, thudding sound, or an equally hard hit or blow,
   like the [thump] your older brother gives you when you embarrass him
   in front of his friends.

   If you drop your backpack full of books it'll make a [thump] as it
   hits the floor. And, if your friend starts to choke on his lemonade
   at lunch, you might want to give him a [thump] on the back. You can
   also [thump] enthusiastically on a drum. [Thump] is an imitative word,
   one that mimics the sound of hitting something heavily. It dates
   from the sixteenth century.

   Here his legs seemed to give way and he collapsed on to the bottom
   of his shell with a [thump].

   adjective
   1. (of food) tender, juicy, and tasty.
      "The pork was deliciously [succulent] and tender with a great
      flavour being imparted from the meat's fat."

   noun
   1. a [succulent] plant.
      "As a rule of thumb, it's hard to go wrong with classics like the
      parlour palm, dracaenas, rubber plants, aspidistra (I've always
      fancied a variegated one), cacti, [succulent]s and the umbrella
      plant."

   [Succulent] means "juicy" and is often used to describe food. Think a
   [succulent] piece of meat, or berries so [succulent] you’re left sucking
   juice off your fingertips when you eat them.

   You can think of the word suck as hiding inside [succulent]––an orange

   1. eat (something) with a continuous and often audible action of the jaws.
      "he munched a chicken wing"

   To munch is to eat something in a loud and enthusiastic way. If you
   can't stand listening to your brother munch his toast in the
   morning, you might decide to take your breakfast to go.

   When you eat something steadily, especially if it's something
   crunchy, you munch. You might munch on carrot sticks for a snack and
   then munch a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch. You can also take a
   munch, or a bite, out of something. Munch is an imitative word, its
   sound echoing the actual sound of [munching], but it may also have a
   connection to the Old French mangier, "to bite or chew."

   adjective
   1. communal.
      "nursing homes and adult [congregate] living facilities"

   [Congregate] is a verb that means to come together, to assemble, or to
   gather. At school dances, you may [congregate] with your friends,
   because you get nervous in front of kids you don't know very well.

   [Congregate] comes from Latin root words com, meaning "together" and
   gregare, meaning "to gather in a flock." Congregation, or a
   gathering or assembly, comes from the same roots, as does
   gregarious, an adjective describing someone who likes to gather with
   others to socialize. If you remember the key word is flock — what
   ministers often call their congregations — you should have no
   trouble remembering [congregate] means to flock together.

   I have never seen so many [congregate]d in so small an area: big ones
   the size of a soup plate and little ones the size of a cup,
   chocolate-coloured great-grandfathers and pale, horn-coloured
   youngsters, all lumbering heavily along the sandy paths, in and out
   of the heather and myrtles, occasionally descending to the
   olive-groves where the vegetation was more succulent.

   Someone who's [lumbering] moves in a heavy, ungainly way. The big,

   You might normally skip lightly down the street, but when you're

   verb
   1. (of several people or things) come together from different directions so as eventually to meet.
      "convoys from America and the UK traversed thousands of miles to
      [converge] in the Atlantic"

   Use the verb [converge] to describe something that comes together at a
   common point: “Thousands of Elvis fans plan to [converge] on the small
   Arkansas town where unconfirmed sightings of the deceased superstar
   eating at a local barbeque restaurant had been widely reported.”

   Two roads, a roomful of politicians, or a group of rabid fans — when
   things come together from different points they [converge]. [Converge]
   traces back to the Latin word vergere, meaning “to bend or to turn."
   The prefix con- means "with," a good way to remember that things
   that [converge] come together. Don't confuse it with diverge, which
   means the opposite: "move away," because the prefix “dis-” means
   “apart.”

   Two or three males, travelling at what - for a tortoise - was a
   gallop, would generally [converge] on the same female.

   1. a person or thing competing with another for the same objective or for superiority in the same field of activity.
      "he has no serious [rival] for the job"

   verb
   1. compete for superiority with; be or seem to be equal or comparable to.
      "the efficiency of the Bavarians [rival]s that of the Viennese"

   A [rival] is a competitor or contender that you want to defeat,
   whether in an actual competition or for another goal. It may be a
   tennis [rival] or a [rival] for your true love’s affections.

   There are all types of [rival]s, but they tend to show up a lot in
   sports. For example, in college football, the Army and Navy have
   been [rival]s since their first meeting in 1890. Something that is
   able to [rival] something else is seen as comparable to it in quality,
   and something that is said to be “without [rival]” is unmatched, or
   better than everything else.

   The general idea was for one to charge his [rival] as rapidly as
   possible, and just before impact to duck his head into his shell.

   verb
   1. crowd (something) untidily; fill with [clutter].
      "his apartment was [clutter]ed with paintings and antiques"

   The word [clutter] can mean a messy jumble of objects. The
   disorganized [clutter] of shoes, hats, shirts, belts, jackets, and
   pants makes it impossible to find a thing in your closet!

   [Clutter] can describe all those disorderly random things in your
   purse, but it can also refer to the random echoes that show up on a
   radar screen. The echos mix with other desired signals and can make
   it hard to track everything. As a verb, [clutter] is what you do when
   you fill up a space with a crazy mix of objects. You may [clutter] up
   the attic when you finally clean out that closet!

   Call a person [sentimental] if he or she is led more by emotions than
   by reason. If you have a [sentimental] attachment to a favorite
   stuffed animal, you'll probably even bring it to college with you.

   [Sentimental] describes a person who relies on emotions more than
   reason, or a novel or film that is overly emotional. Derived from
   the Latin verb, sentire "to feel," [sentimental] always implies that
   the emotions are involved a little too much. If you do something for
   [sentimental] reasons, you are only doing it because of an emotional
   attachment.

   2. a form of address ascribed to sailors.
      "I wanted to add, ‘there, me hearties ,’ but ‘ahoj’ is actually

   [Hearty] describes abundant, full, and satisfying things, and lively,
   strong, and enthusiastic people. A bowl of thick chili with cheese
   and a glass of milk is [hearty]. A spoon of water with a grape? Not so
   [hearty].

   You can't miss the "heart" in [hearty]. Words like "wholehearted" and
   "half-hearted" also have "heart" and are a help in remembering the
   adjective [hearty]. If you put your whole heart into anything from
   walking a dog to saying good morning to your friends, you're [hearty]
   and full of life. Something half-hearted is weak and not [hearty]. A
   loud laugh that fills a room is very [hearty]; you can almost feel its
   fullness. If it comes from the heart and adds well-being and
   happiness, it's probably [hearty].

   adverb
   1. as far as one knows or can see.
      "the child nodded, [apparently] content with the promise"

   [Apparently] is an adverb meaning "evidently" or "obviously." After
   his sixth hot dog, you might say to your friend, "Well! [Apparently]
   somebody was hungry!"

   While [apparently] can mean "plainly" — like, duh — it can also mean
   "seemingly," which is almost "evidently" or "obviously," but not
   quite. There's a certain amount of guessing involved, based on
   appearances. The park ranger who shows up in the morning to examine
   the path of destruction through your campsite might say that it was
   "[apparently] the work of a hungry bear," not because he's totally
   sure, but because it definitely looks like something the bears
   around here would do.

   After some time, when she had excavated quite a pile of earth, she
   carefully scrutinized the hole from all angles and was [apparently]
   satisfied.

   To [doze] is to just have a little sleep: either a short nap or a very
   light snooze. Since [doze] and snooze almost rhyme — and snoring
   sounds a little like ZZZZZZZZZZZ — the letter Z might be a good way

   1. an advantage or profit gained from something.
      "tenants bought their houses with the [benefit] of a discount"
   2. a payment or gift made by an employer, the state, or an insurance company.

      gig for multiple-sclerosis charities."

   verb
   1. receive an advantage; profit; gain.
      "areas that would [benefit] from regeneration"

   A [benefit] is something that helps you, whether in the form of health
   insurance provided by an employer, welfare given by the government
   to those in need, or the [benefit] of the doubt extended to you by a
   friend.

   The Latin bene- "good" is at the heart of the word [benefit], which
   derives from the Latin benefactum "good deed." When attendance at a
   party or an event raises money for a charity, the event is referred
   to as a [benefit] in that charity's honor.

   no, no, of course not,' said Mother guiltily, as though she had been
   planning vast banquets among the myrtle bushes for Jonquil's
   [benefit].

   [Clad] means "dressed or covered." Most kids go to school [clad] in
   jeans and t-shirts, but students in the Shakespeare club might show
   up [clad] in velvet gowns or leather breeches.

   As it applies to what a person is wearing, [clad] is the past
   participle of clothe. If you wanted to talk about the day your
   friend commanded you to clothe yourself in green and you obeyed,
   you'd say, "I [clad] myself in green." Of course, it sounds archaic.
   Like talking about your shoes by saying shod.

   An [almond] is an oval-shaped nut that grows inside a hard shell.
   [Almond]s grow on [almond] trees.

   [Almond]s are native to Mediterranean climates, particularly South
   Asia and the Middle East, and have spread to parts of North Africa,
   Southern Europe, and California. [Almond] trees flower in the spring,
   before the nuts are ready to harvest. While wild [almond]s are
   poisonous, the nut of the domesticated, sweet [almond] is delicious.
   We know the word [almond] comes from the Greek amygdalos, or "[almond]
   tree," but its origin beyond that is uncertain.

   1. an act of asking for information.
      "the deluge of phone inquiries after a crash"

   When you ask the guy behind the counter if they've got any aspirin,
   you're making an [inquiry]. Almost any search for information or
   knowledge is an [inquiry], though an [inquiry] is often an official
   search.

   Though any question is, technically, an [inquiry], that word is
   usually used to refer to an official or public search for the truth.
   For instance, after a plane crash, the government launches an
   [inquiry] into the cause. Politicians and government officials are
   often the ones who demand an [inquiry] when an important question
   needs to be answered, but a child can do the same thing. If your kid
   wants to know what's for dinner, she can make an [inquiry] about it.
   She can also just — you know — ask.

   On [inquiry], it turned out that this unfortunate experience had taken
   place two years previously, and Durant had still not recovered from
   it.

   1. (of a group of people) come or go together or in large numbers.

   A [troop] is a squad or team of soldiers. Your great grandfather might
   claim that his was the first army [troop] to march into France during
   World War II.

   Though it's correct to use the noun [troop] in the singular form, it's
   more common to see its plural, [troop]s. You can also refer to a group
   of Girl or Boy Scouts this way: "My [troop] won a prize for selling
   the most Girl Scout cookies this year." To [troop] is also to march,
   so a military [troop] might [troop] down the street in the Veteran's Day
   parade. The root word is the Old French trope, "band of people."

   In the middle of the night we were awakened by a noise that sounded
   like a [troop] of bloodhounds being slowly strangled.

   A person who lives simply and economically can be called [frugal].
   Buying clothes at a consignment shop would be considered [frugal]. Not
   getting your mom a gift for her birthday — that's just cheap.

   Thrifty, spartan, and prudent are synonyms for [frugal], a word that
   often has positive connotations when used to describe a person who
   lives a simple life. "The question for retailers is whether shoppers
   will remain [frugal] or slowly resume their old spending habits
   whenever they get more money in their pockets," wrote The Wall
   Street Journal. You might also speak of "a [frugal] meal" — a very
   plain, cheap one. The word is from Latin frux, meaning "fruit" (in
   the sense of "profit").

   live in a [frugal] way.

   adjective
   1. attractively unusual or old-fashioned.
      "[quaint] country cottages"

   [Quaint] means strange and unusual in an old-fashioned and charming
   way. It's a word you'd use to describe a little store that sells tea
   cozies and antique tea services, or your grandmother's habit of
   calling the radio the "wireless."

   There is a commonly used sarcastic sense of [quaint]––when something
   is run down or shabby and you're trying to say something positive,
   you might substitute "How...[quaint]" for "How...interesting." In
   Middle English, this adjective meant clever or cunning. Its origin
   is Old French queinte, cointe, from Latin cognitus "known," from
   cognōscere "to learn."

   attractive; [quaint].

   1. a defensive wall of a castle or walled city, having a broad top with a walkway and typically a stone parapet.
      "Take the track to the left of the castle [rampart]s , rounding
      small sewage works on its left."

   verb
   1. fortify or surround with or as if with a [rampart].

   If you are building a sand castle and want it to be extra realistic,
   don’t forget the [rampart]. This protective wall may not keep the

   This noun is derived from the French verb remparer, meaning “to

   a large defensive wall surrounding a castle, but can be a barrier
   built along a road or an embankment constructed alongside a river.
   This word is famously used in the lyrics of "The Star-Spangled

   Use [faltering] as a noun to mean the act of wavering or pausing
   uncertainly, or as an adjective: "My [faltering] answer did not
   impress the history professor." [Faltering] progress on your
   neighbor's house addition might make you wonder if it'll ever be

   Something that is [gory] often involves both violence and bloodshed,
   but it can also describe something that is merely blood, like the

   snob has nothing but [contempt] for mass-produced burgers and fries at
   a fast-food joint.

   [Contempt] has nothing to do with the verb condemn, despite the

   It's a harsh term and should be used with care; it's stronger than
   either disdain or scorn. It suggests you find someone or something
   utterly worthless. That food snob might say the words "Big Mac" or

   2. a knot used for fastening a rope to another rope or something else.
      "Lash ropes and diamond [hitch]es are untied, the horses unpacked
      and then hobbled or tethered in the meadow below camp."
   3. an act of [hitch]hiking.
   4. a period of service.
      "his 12-year [hitch] in the navy"

   verb
   1. move (something) into a different position with a jerk.
      "she [hitch]ed the blanket around him"
   2. travel by [hitch]hiking.
      "Rural Ireland was recommended as a friendly place for [hitch]ing ,
      as was Quebec - ‘if you don't mind being berated for not speaking
      French’."
   3. fasten or tether with a rope.
      "he returned to where he had [hitch]ed his horse"

   A [hitch] is an obstacle or hindrance. You might be late because of a
   last minute [hitch], like waiting for a family of ducks to cross the
   road. If things go well, they go off without a [hitch].

   The word [hitch] has a gazillion meanings — it’s a hook, a limp, short
   for [hitch]hiking, slang for getting married — but the most common
   meaning is that a [hitch] is a little problem. If you’ve packed a
   picnic and then it rains, the weather is a [hitch] in your plans.
   [Hitch]es include hang-ups, snafus, impediments, and other things that
   interfere. Often this term is used in the phrase "without a [hitch]"
   for things that go smoothly.

   It’s also a [hitch] in a plan.

   1. excessively proud of oneself; vain.
      "Not to be vain or [conceited] , but it was the truth and anyone
      sensible would agree."

   A [conceited] person has an inflated self-image and perceives himself
   as incredibly entertaining and wonderful. Talk incessantly about
   your accomplishments on the clarinet or amazing ability to wiggle
   your ears, and people are going to think you’re [conceited].

   An offshoot of conceit, [conceited] was first recorded in 1600 as
   meaning “having an overwhelming opinion of oneself.” It’s a
   shortened form of “self-[conceited]” and the total opposite of
   "modest." In a remark about such vain people, the English Victorian
   novelist George Eliot once said, “I've never any pity for [conceited]
   people, because I think they carry their comfort about with them.”

   a stiff, erect, and apparently arrogant or [conceited] gait.

   1. great courage in the face of danger, especially in battle.
      "the medals are awarded for acts of [valor]"

   [Valor] is honor plus dignity. It’s gallant bravery and strength,
   especially on the battlefield or in the face of danger. Saint George
   displayed [valor] when he finally slayed the dragon. It’s a trait fit
   for a hero.

   [Valor] comes from the Latin [valor]em for “strength, moral worth,” with
   the sense of “courage” added later. [Valor] is often displayed in the
   face of something designed to crush it, like a battle in a war, and
   it is often rewarded with the conferring of a medal. [Valor] is a word
   associated with war heroes and knights of yore, but anyone who faces
   death and doesn’t look away displays [valor].

   At first [virtue] meant manliness or [valor], but over time it settled

   Use the adjective [posterior] to describe something that's in the
   back. It’s often used in anatomy — a [posterior] cerebral artery
   supplies blood to the back of the brain, and the tail is on the
   [posterior] of a fish.

   The prefix post means “after,” and things that are [posterior] come
   after the things in the front. The opposite of [posterior] is
   anterior, which refers to the front, usually of body parts. You can
   also use the word [posterior] to jokingly refer to the part of your
   body that you sit on — your backside. [Posterior] is also a formal way
   to say later in time.

      "Galileo's telescope had a convex object lens but a [concave]

   [Concave] describes an inward curve; its opposite, convex, describes a
   curve that bulges outward. They are used to describe gentle, subtle
   curves, like the kinds found in mirrors or lenses.

   A valley is a [concave] curve, a mountain is a convex curve—you can
   remember this by thinking that things that vex you tend to stick
   out, and that caves tend to be holes that go in, like valleys or
   innie belly buttons. If you want to describe a bowl, you might say
   there is a large blue spot on the center of the [concave] side.

   Stand up when the powers that be order you to sit down, and you've
   given a fine example of [defiance]. It happens when someone or a group
   of someones openly flouts or challenges authority.

   We owe this lovely descriptive term to the French — specifically to
   the Old French word defier, which means to defy. (Don't mix it up
   with deify; that means to make someone or something into a god.) If
   you've ever studied Latin, you'll spot the fi from fidare "to trust"
   that inspired the Marines' "semper fi" motto and the popular moniker
   for pooches––"Fido." Combining fi with de- negates it. So an act of
   [defiance] is essentially an act of not trusting.

   showing [defiance].

   The Latin root of [gorge] means "throat," leading to both the "narrow
   passage" meaning and the French gorgier, "to swallow," which
   influenced the verb version of [gorge], "to overeat." You may love to
   [gorge] on ice cream, but the stomachache afterward won't be very
   pleasant. To remember the "canyon" meaning, think of the famous
   upstate New York bumper sticker, “Ithaca is [gorge]s.” It's a play on
   [gorge]ous, meaning beautiful, and the beautiful ravines in the area.

      "a [vain] attempt to tidy up the room"

   If you spend all day admiring yourself in reflective surfaces —
   mirrors, pools of water, the backs of spoons — people may think you
   are conceited or [vain].

   If, to your horror, you have searched everywhere for a reflective
   surface but can't find one, you have made a fruitless or [vain] search
   for a mirror. [Vain] is from Latin vanus "empty," and in English it
   originally meant "lacking value or effect, futile"; we still say "a
   [vain] attempt" using that sense, and the phrase "in [vain]" means
   "without success." Normally, though, [vain] means "conceited, too
   proud of oneself." Carly Simon's line "You're so [vain], you probably
   think this song is about you" is an excellent illustration of this

   [Deceit] comes from the Latin for "cheat." When you deceive someone,

   with something bad. If a person speaks in a way that gives a false

   continued to be used through the 1400s, when Europeans began making

   noun
   1. one side of something many-sided, especially of a cut gem.
      "The many voices of the metropolis only come together like [facet]s
      of a many-sided prism in the fourth projection, which stands
      separate from the other three."

   A [facet] is one side or aspect of something. If you’re thinking about
   quitting your day job to become a circus performer, you should first
   consider every [facet] of what your new life would be like.

   [Facet], which is related to the word face, can also refer to one of
   the flat “faces” of a diamond or other gem. This was the word’s
   original definition, and it was evidently seen as an apt metaphor
   for one side of a complex idea. When a problem has many parts to
   consider (or when it’s just a huge mess), you can describe it as
   multi[facet]ed.

   "Clearly a master of her modest medium, she folds paper into [facet]s,
   [quill]s it into curlicues and cuts it into intricate, lacelike
   filigree."

   1. ornamental work of fine (typically gold or silver) wire formed into delicate tracery.
      "delicate silver [filigree] earrings"

   Ancient handmade jewelry is often known for its [filigree], which is a
   noun describing delicate ornamental work made of some type of metal.

   [Filigree] comes from the Latin word for thread. Usually the strands
   of silver, gold, or wire used for this type of ornamentation is so
   fine, it appears almost like thin threads wound together. It
   wouldn’t be a bad find to stumble on a chest full of gold
   [filigree]-framed items in your grandmother’s attic, especially if she
   wanted you to keep them! The word can also be used as a verb to
   describe the act of making [filigree].

   [Intimidation] can refer to the act of making someone feel timid or
   afraid — like what you sometimes do to your brother — or it can also
   refer to that fearful feeling itself. [Intimidation] might make

   also refer to feeling threatened, discouraged, or afraid because
   you're facing something stronger or superior. You might feel a sense
   of [intimidation] right before your soccer team plays the undefeated

      "she left her animals to [starve]"
   2. be freezing cold.
      "pull down that window for we are perfectly starving here"

   The verb [starve] means suffering or death caused by a lack of food,
   though people also use it as a dramatic way to say they are hungry,
   as in, "If we don't start cooking dinner now, I think I'll [starve]."

   The word [starve] has origins in the Old English word steorfan,
   meaning “to die.” It is true that if you don't eat for a period of
   time, you could [starve], meaning die from hunger. Today, [starve] is
   also used to describe less severe limitations on food, such as when
   you tell your friend, "I have to go to lunch now. I'm starving."
   This is a way of describing discomfort caused by hunger.

   The other male now became terribly [harass]ed and apparently a prey

   A [flaw] can be a sign of weakness or defect. If you try to make wings

   In the early 14th century, when the noun [flaw] was first recorded, it
   referred to a snowflake or spark of fire. That sense is now
   obsolete, and now we use [flaw] to describe shortcomings in either
   character or object. We all have [flaw]s. It can also describe an
   intentional mark of imperfection. “You see,” said the dancer Martha
   Graham, “when weaving a blanket, an Indian woman leaves a [flaw] in
   the weaving of that blanket to let the soul out.”

   A [liability] is a debt or obligation or a personal [flaw] that stands

   1. the quality of being full of energy, excitement, and cheerfulness; ebullience.
      "a sense of youthful [exuberance]"

   Use [exuberance] to describe joyful enthusiasm and liveliness. You
   appreciate the natural [exuberance] of small children, but you prefer
   to enjoy it from a distance.

   The noun [exuberance] comes from the adjective exuberant, which itself
   came from a Latin word that originally described an overflowing
   supply of milk from the udder of a cow or goat! The word still means
   "overflowing," not with milk but with joy and enthusiasm. After your
   winning home run, the fans ran onto the field and, in their
   [exuberance], carried you off on their shoulders . . . before you
   touched home plate.

*** ~~+~~
    бесцеремонно

    adverb
    1. грубо (rough, roughly, tough, rudely, grossly, brusquely)
    2. бесцеремонно (offhand, brusquely, offhandedly, familiarly)

    When something is done brusquely it is done in a flat out,
    no-nonsense or crude manner. If you try to talk a teacher into
    changing your grade from a “C” to an “A,” your request will probably
    be dismissed brusquely.

    Brusquely often signifies rudeness; it implies that the action is a
    little too blunt, direct, or curt. This adverb is basically the
    opposite of tactfully or gently. A political candidate might
    brusquely reject the position of his or her opponent, or a baseball
    coach might brusquely challenge an umpire’s call.

    "she [shoulder]ed him brusquely aside"

   1. a person or thing regarded as a perfect example of a particular quality.
      "it would have taken a [paragon] of virtue not to feel viciously
      jealous"

   [Paragon] applies to someone who is a model of perfection in some
   quality or trait. We link [paragon] with other words that follow it,
   such as "[paragon] of virtue" or "[paragon] of patience."

   A [paragon] means someone or something that is the very best. The
   English noun [paragon] comes from the Italian word [paragon]e, which is
   a touchstone, a black stone that is used to tell the quality of
   gold. You rub the gold on the touchstone and you can find out how
   good the gold is. You are hoping that it is the [paragon] of
   "goldness."

      "a [despicable] crime"

   Stealing the last piece of food from a starving child goes way
   beyond mean. It's [despicable] — a vile and harmful act.

   Mean, nasty, and scummy are synonyms of [despicable], but they don't
   fully convey the awfulness of [despicable]. A man who lies to get a
   promotion meant for his co-worker would be considered mean. But the
   [despicable] man — the one who is so awful and worthless that he
   deserves to be despised — is the one who burns down the office
   building and frames his co-worker for it.

      "his theory was [ridiculed] and dismissed"

   When you ridicule someone, you mock or make fun of them. They become
   the object of your ridicule or mockery. Your bad behavior might
   bring ridicule on your parents, who raised you to know better.

   The word ridicule is related to ridiculous. If you ridicule a
   friend, you try to make them look ridiculous. But now that isn't
   very friendly! Both words come from the Latin redire which means to
   laugh. When you are [ridiculed], you are made a laughing stock, but
   being the object of ridicule is never funny.

   1. a state of prolonged mutual hostility, typically between two families or communities, characterized by violent assaults in revenge for previous injuries.

   verb
   1. take part in a prolonged quarrel or conflict.
      "these two families have been [feud]ing since the Civil War"

   abbreviation
   1. [feud]al.

   A [feud] is a long-standing fight, often between two families. In
   Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare describes the lovers' long-[feud]ing
   families, the Capulets and the Montagues.

   [Feud]s do not have to be violent—what characterizes them is
   long-standing hostility. Ethnic groups can sometimes be said to be
   [feud]ing. Kids in school who refuse to sit at the same lunch table
   over a period of years could describe their relationship as a [feud].

   But as a noun, a [flap] is a fuss, an argument, or a gossipy [feud].

      "They are burglars, dealers, vandals, thugs, [mugger]s , arsonists,

   2. a large short-snouted Indian crocodile, venerated by many Hindus.

   Someone who steals another person's personal property after

   Most [mugger]s attack their victims in a public place.

   To steal things from someone is to rob them, and when it happens
   outside on the street or sidewalk, especially with the threat of
   violence, the robber is usually called a [mugger]. A [mugger] might
   brandish a weapon or merely threaten harm, and he usually steals
   money, jewelry, cell phones, or other valuables. [Mugger] comes from
   the verb mug, or "beat up," which originally meant "punch in the
   face," from the nickname mug, or "face."

   People can also [swoop] — three [mugger]s might [swoop] in on a
   victim, for example.

   verb
   1. live in or at a specified place.
      "groups of gypsies still [dwell] in these caves"
   2. think, speak, or write at length about (a particular subject, especially one that is a source of unhappiness, anxiety, or dissatisfaction).

   1. a slight regular pause in the motion of a machine.
      "The interim [dwell] takes place before the second substep and

   To [dwell] in a home is to live in it. To [dwell] on something — usually
   something bad, like a failed romance or terrible service in a
   restaurant –- is to think or speak about it at great length.

   [Dwell] has been part of the English language for over 1,000 years.
   The definition of the word has evolved considerably since its first
   recorded use in the ninth century when Old English [dwell]an meant
   "lead astray" or "hinder." If you constantly [dwell] on the bad things
   in life, it could hinder you from seeing the good or lead you astray
   to the negative. If you keep complaining, your friends might tell
   you to stop [dwell]ing on it or, if they're really annoyed, they'll
   say, "Get over it!"

   You can also [brood], when you worry and sulk and [dwell] on something
   obsessively — maybe as tedious as sitting on eggs, but no chicks
   when you're done.

   Ominously is a word to describe how something threatening appears.
   If you're golfing and dark gray clouds ominously appear, you'd
   better call it a day.

   Originating from the Latin word ominosus, meaning "full of
   foreboding," the adverb ominously indicates when an action is done
   in an ominous manner, possibly indicating danger or evil is in the
   future. You might want to reconsider that moonlit hike if a wolf
   ominously howls just as you are about to begin. If gigantic waves
   are ominously crashing into the shore, it would be wise to devote
   the day to building a sand castle rather than snorkeling.

   Things like clouds or silence can also [brood], hanging over
   something ominously, as a storm that [brood]s over the sea, sending
   fishermen scurrying for safety.

   verb
   1. (of a child, animal, or plant) grow or develop well or vigorously.
      "the new baby [thrive]d"

   To [thrive] is to do well or flourish. If your new cookie delivery
   business [thrive]s, you'll be rolling in dough — not literally, of
   course.

   The verb [thrive] means to flourish or grow vigorously, and it can be
   applied to something like a business or to something or someone's
   actual health. Plants can [thrive] in a greenhouse, and children can
   [thrive] if they eat well and exercise. Thriving can also be used more
   figuratively — "The women [thrive]d on gossip; they loved knowing who
   was dating or divorcing whom."

   Some of the most influential people in history did poorly in school
   because school’s format wasn’t the best way for them to [thrive].

   verb
   1. cause (someone) to lose determination or confidence.
      "the farmer was [disheartened] by the damage to his crops"

   When you're [disheartened], you feel discouraged or let down. It's
   easy to become [disheartened] if the grades on your report card don't
   reflect the hard work and dedication you exerted.

   You might be [disheartened] to read about the high unemployment rate
   in the newspaper, or [disheartened] by the way your carefully
   constructed rocket ship cake flopped. When you feel your spirits
   sink or your courage fail, you're [disheartened]. The first recorded
   use of the word dishearten showed up in Shakespeare's play Henry V,
   where he invented it to mean the opposite of hearten, or
   "encourage."

   You will become frustrated with your peers - If you have a high
   level of self-awareness/self-conscientiousness for someone at your
   age, you will find yourself incredibly annoyed/disheartened with
   the lack of it in your peer group.

   noun
   1. a stupid person.
      "Stupid [moron] , the chances of me falling for anyone at this
      party were one in twenty million."

   noun
   1. a city in eastern Argentina, southwest of Buenos Aires; population 327,600 (est. 2008).

   When your little brother does something that is both stupid and
   infuriating, you'll have to bite your tongue to keep from calling
   him a [moron]. A [moron] is an unkind way to describe someone who is
   foolish and unintelligent.

   The word [moron] was an official term in the early 1900s, used to
   describe a person of low intelligence — specifically, an "adult with
   a mental age between eight and twelve." It became a popular insult
   in the 1920s, and gradually stopped being used as a medical term,
   until [moron] was only an informal way to put someone down.

   Most college students act like relative [moron]s because the
   prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain that makes decisions) has
   not fully formed and is a long way from doing so (at 25).

   1. uncertainty or inexactness of meaning in language.
      "we can detect no [ambiguity] in this section of the Act"

   Something with [ambiguity] is unclear. Think about the sentence, "Jill
   saw the man with binoculars." If you are wondering whether Jill or
   the man had the binoculars, you are noticing the [ambiguity], or the
   double meaning, of this sentence.

   Lawyers word contracts to avoid [ambiguity], but in doing so prevent
   anyone who is not a lawyer from understanding what they have
   written! If you can't choose between two decisions because both seem
   somehow wrong, you are dealing with moral [ambiguity]. Imagine if a
   friend who has helped you out many times asks you to cheat. It's
   wrong to cheat but it also seems wrong not to help someone who has
   been there for you.

   In times of moral [ambiguity], you need to have a solid moral
   foundation to make decisions.

   To [tempt] is to lure or entice. You might [tempt] your runaway dog back
   inside with pieces of cheese.

   The verb [tempt] often has negative implications: "Don't let those
   bullies [tempt] you into picking on smaller kids!" When something
   [tempt]s you, it's often with the knowledge that it's not the best
   idea, however attractive it might be. [Tempt] was originally a
   religious term, meaning "to entice to evil or sin," while today it's
   more likely to be a slice of cake that [tempt]s us than the devil.

   [Sake] means the purpose for doing something. You might run a
   fund-raising marathon for the [sake] of sick children.

   [Sake] comes from the old English term for "affair," or "cause of
   guilt." We usually use [sake] to talk about the motivating cause of
   something we do. You might study hard for the [sake] of your grades.
   But then again, you might blow off your studies for the [sake] of
   having fun. Spelled the same way, but pronounced SAH-key, [sake] is
   also the name of a Japanese alcoholic drink made from fermented
   rice.

   verb
   1. indulge in an activity, especially eating, to excess.
      "some dieters say they cannot help binging on chocolate"

   A [binge] is a brief period of doing something excessively. You might
   celebrate your birthday by indulging in a banana cream pie [binge] if
   that's your very favorite dessert.

   [Binge] rhymes with fringe. If you give in to your urges and really
   indulge yourself, you [binge] on something, whether it's candy, video
   games, or shopping. There's an implied sense in the word [binge] that
   you're doing too much of something that isn't very good for you in
   the first place. [Binge] is also a verb, as in people who [binge] on
   television, watching show after show.

   When a friend is [binge] drinking and they're clearly not able to
   decide when to stop, do you step in?

   1. (of a person, animal, or their behavior) causing or showing a fondness for causing trouble in a playful way.
      "two [mischievous] kittens had decorated the bed with shredded
      newspaper"

   If you’re the one making prank phone calls at 3 am and you can’t
   resist short-sheeting your camp counselor’s bunk, you're
   [mischievous]. If your dog likes to decorate your house with streamers
   of toilet paper, he's [mischievous], too.

   You can be [mischievous] in harmless, playful ways, or you might also
   use the word [mischievous] to describe behavior that's more than just
   a little naughty. If you post online some embarrassing photos of an
   acquaintance, your more generous friends might describe your
   behavior as [mischievous], although others might accuse you of being
   downright mean. Keep in mind that the word has only three syllables:
   MIS-chuh-vuhs.

   A gremlin does not gorge on the flesh of the dead; it is more a
   [mischievous] imp and troublemaker, famous for causing mechanical
   difficulties in World War II aircraft.

   A [ward] is a group of rooms or a section in a hospital or prison; in
   a hospital, different [ward]s deal with different needs, like the
   psychiatric [ward] or maternity [ward].

   Although [ward] is most often used in connection with hospitals and
   prisons, cities and towns can also be broken into [ward]s. These are
   usually geographic areas that are used in elections: city council
   members often represent [ward]s of the city. A [ward] is also the name
   given to a child who is watched over by someone other than his
   parents. Sometimes children are known as "[ward]s of the state,"
   meaning they have been taken from their homes.

   Mean, nasty, and scummy are synonyms of [despicable], but they don't

   promotion meant for his co-worker would be considered mean. But the

   Reserve the noun [contempt] for an extreme lack of respect: a food

   [Contempt] has nothing to do with the verb condemn, despite the
   similarity in sound and meaning; it is from Latin temnere "to
   despise," and if you despise someone, you have [contempt] for them.
   It's a harsh term and should be used with care; it's stronger than
   either disdain or scorn. It suggests you find someone or something
   utterly worthless. That food snob might say the words "Big Mac" or

   If you're looking for a formal adjective to describe something sly
   or secret, sneak in [furtive]. Let's hope the teacher doesn't see your
   [furtive] attempts to pass notes in class!

   The adjective, [furtive], is related to fūrtum, the Latin word for
   theft or robbery. This is apparent as the expressions "to give
   someone a [furtive] glance" and "to steal a glance at someone" mean
   the same thing. If a person's manner is [furtive], he or she is acting
   suspiciously. Secret, stealthy and sly are all similar in meaning,
   but they lack this image of a thief's actions.

   verb
   1. occupy (property) as a [tenant]. "These standards will apply to all

   A [tenant] is someone who lives in a place owned by someone else,
   usually paying rent. If you blast your music and let the cat pee in
   the corner, your landlord will not think that you're a very good
   [tenant].

   [Tenant] is often used to mean "renter," but it can mean anyone who
   has the right to live in a particular place, either because he
   signed a lease, which is a rental agreement, because he owns the
   land, or because government gave him a title to it. If you live in a
   big apartment building, you should be aware of your rights as a
   [tenant], which usually include things like having heat in the winter
   and proper fire escapes.

   A [penchant] is a strong preference or tendency. If you have a
   [penchant] for pizza, you either eat it daily or wish you did.

   [Penchant] borrows from French, in which [penchant] literally means
   inclined. It goes back to the Latin pendere, for hanging, which is
   also the source of pendant. In both French and English, speakers
   have long used the idea of inclination metaphorically: a hillside
   can be inclined in one direction or another, and so can a person's
   thoughts. But in English, [penchant] is only for desires.

   If you are [ardent], you are passionate about something. A pop star's

   from excitement.

   [Ardent] is most often used to modify words like supporter, fan,
   advocate, admirer, and defender — but also opponent. Although you
   can either [ardent]ly support or oppose something, support is by far
   the more common use. The word literally means "burning" or "glowing"
   — it's from Latin ardere, "to burn." In poetic use, the word is
   sometimes used to mean "glowing," as Alexander Pope did in his 1718
   translation of Homer's Iliad: "From rank to rank she darts her
   [ardent] eyes."

      cilantro"
   2. a person who is very difficult to deal with or control. "the kids

   A [handful] is just a little of something, or the amount you can hold
   in your hand. It can be a literal [handful], like a [handful] of
   popcorn, or it can mean just a few, like a [handful] of trucks.

   You might find yourself eating [handful]s of raspberries when you're
   supposed to be picking them to make jam. Another meaning of [handful]
   is "just a few," as in "There are only a [handful] of dogs at the dog
   park this morning." And a third way to use this word is to mean
   "incredibly difficult to handle." If your mom says, "You were a
   [handful] when you were a toddler," she means you were not easy.

   which was in turn a short version of the word fantasy. All three

   Someone who is [fanciful] usually allows creative thought rather than

   [Fowl] comes from the Old English fugel, "bird," meant simply that —
   "bird." Today, [fowl] usually refers specifically to chickens or other
   kinds of domesticated birds that lay eggs or are raised to be eaten.
   Occasionally, [fowl] is used interchangeably with poultry, to mean the
   flesh of that same kind of bird when it's eaten; you could describe
   your family as being fond of pork, beef, and [fowl].

   If something is so great you can hardly believe it, it is [fabulous].

   Your [demeanor] is defined as being either your facial appearance or
   your behavior. When playing poker, don't let your [demeanor] give away
   how good your cards are.

   [Demeanor] in English today has evolved from Middle English and Old
   French to refer to the way one manages or presents oneself, and this
   definition applies to conduct as well as facial expressions. The way
   you present yourself often affects how others make judgments about
   you and therefore, you might want your [demeanor] to reflect the
   situation you're in. So, if you're at a birthday party, your
   [demeanor] should be happy and smiling!

   [demeanor] when they are being nasty.

   A [shudder] is an involuntary vibration, usually in your body, or the

   As a verb, [shudder] means to shake and shiver. Being really cold or
   seeing something that scares you — a ghost! — can make you [shudder].
   The phrase "[shudder] to think" means just the thought of something
   upsets you enough to [shudder].

   Someone about to do something evil might first give an [acrid]
   sneer, or speak in a chillingly [acrid] tone of voice, or even
   [shudder] as if they'd just bit into something with an [acrid] taste.

   noun
   1. a short, sharp, high-pitched sound. "‘The territorial calls
      produced by the males are short buzzes, trills, [chirp]s and
      combinations of clicks,’ said French as she demonstrated."

   verb
   1. (typically of a small bird or an insect) utter a short, sharp,
      high-pitched sound. "outside, the crickets [chirp]ed monotonously"

   A [chirp] is the short, high sound a bird makes. The [chirp]s of the
   robins at your bird feeder through the open window might drive your
   cat crazy.

   Birds [chirp] — you could also say they tweet, twitter, cheep, and
   warble — and some insects [chirp] too. An extremely cheerful person
   also [chirp]s: "The overly enthusiastic tour guide [chirp]s happily as
   the bus moves through the city." [Chirp] may have developed as an
   imitation of the sound itself, or it may stem from the Middle
   English chirken, "twitter," which is rooted in the Old English
   cearcian, "to creak."

   Another kind of [peep] is the high [chirp]ing sound a chick or baby
   bird makes.

   adjective
   1. having a leak or leaks. "a [leaky] roof"

   [Leaky] things accidentally allow water (or gas) to pass through them.
   A [leaky] bucket is a bad thing, and a [leaky] diaper is even worse.

   A [leaky] hose lets water squirt out at different points, and a [leaky]
   helium balloon plummets to the ground, deflating as it falls. You
   can also talk about a [leaky] government, or a [leaky] newsroom — in
   other words, a group or a person guilty of exposing information
   that's meant to be kept secret or confidential. This kind of leak is
   a "deliberate disclosure of information," and it dates from the
   1950s.

   [Futile] comes from the Latin futilis, which originally meant
   "[leaky]."

    adverb
    1. грубо (rough, roughly, tough, rudely, grossly, brusquely)
    2. бесцеремонно (offhand, brusquely, offhandedly, familiarly)

    When something is done brusquely it is done in a flat out,
    no-nonsense or crude manner. If you try to talk a teacher into
    changing your grade from a “C” to an “A,” your request will probably
    be dismissed brusquely.

    Brusquely often signifies rudeness; it implies that the action is a
    little too blunt, direct, or curt. This adverb is basically the
    opposite of tactfully or gently. A political candidate might
    brusquely reject the position of his or her opponent, or a baseball
    coach might brusquely challenge an umpire’s call.

   You can use the adjective [swift] to describe things that move or
   happen rapidly and smoothly. Deciding to borrow a parent's car
   without permission could result in [swift] punishment. Foxes are so
   [swift] that if you leave the chicken coop open for a moment, one

   adjective
   1. feeling or showing anger or annoyance at what is perceived as
      unfair treatment. "he was [indignant] at being the object of
      suspicion"

   When you're [indignant], you're angry about an unfair situation. If
   you discovered that a teacher gave ten extra points on a test to all
   students who sat in the front row, you'd be [indignant].

   [Indignant] is from Latin indignus "unworthy," and it refers to anger
   based on unworthy or unfair behavior rather than merely injury to
   one's own interests. You may be angry, even furious, if someone
   shoves you, but you are [indignant] if the shove is directed at
   someone weak or helpless. The related noun is indignation, and
   something that arouses indignation is an indignity.

   [Impatience] is the tendency to be irritable or easily frustrated. A
   bus driver's [impatience] often results in her yelling, honking her
   horn, and gesturing angrily at other drivers.

   If you are easily annoyed or provoked, your [impatience] is showing.
   [Impatience] is also why you hate being late, or having to wait for
   something or someone. It comes from patience, the habit or trait of
   being able to wait calmly or even tolerate discomfort without

   [Pretension] is what you're guilty of when you boorishly try to
   impress other people with how important or clever you are.

   When you speak with [pretension], you're boastful and you puff
   yourself up as someone very important or of great worth. If you have
   literary pretentions, you mostly likely think you're a great writer,
   but you most likely are not. As you might imagine, this word has the

   People who go to church but don't believe in god? People who are

   engaging in [hypocrisy], or behavior that is different from what they
   say they believe.

   A hypocrite is a person who practices [hypocrisy]: what they say is

   hypokrisis "acting on a stage," from hypokrinesthai "to play a part,

   [Arrogant] is an adjective for describing people who are too proud and
   look down on others, like supermodels who think their good looks
   give them a right to do whatever they want.

   [Arrogant] derives from Latin arrogare "to claim," and the idea is
   that someone is claiming credit or advantages that they are not
   entitled to. It's close in meaning to haughty and supercilious, but
   both of those have connotations of coolness and perceived
   superiority that [arrogant] does not. An aristocrat could be called
   all three, but a customs official or traffic cop is more likely to
   be called [arrogant] than the other terms.

   1. having rough, sharp points protruding. "the [jagged] edges gashed
      their fingers"

   verb
   1. stab, pierce, or prick. "she [jagged] herself in the mouth"

   Something is [jagged] when it has an uneven edge or quality to it.
   Teeth can be [jagged], saw blades can be [jagged], and the edges of
   leaves can be [jagged].

   [Jagged] comes from 16th century English/Scottish and originally
   referred to a cloth, cut in a way so that the edge is not straight,
   but that is “toothed.” Imagine a tipsy seamstress trying to cut
   cloth in a straight line, but her sheers stray this way then that.
   She’s leaving a [jagged] edge on the cloth. Or perhaps you have a
   crush on the seamstress, but she is seen kissing another. Here,
   she’s leaving a [jagged] wound on your heart.

   a sharp, angular, or [jagged] projection.

      of the earth or a celestial sphere. "Finally, the plane
      [projection] of the map doesn't quite work."

   When you push something away from a central structure, that's called
   [projection]. If you predict that the Jets will win tomorrow's game,
   that's a [projection], too — you're pushing your mind away from the
   present and into the future.

   The Jets and [projection] actually have a common linguistic ancestor.
   Both the ject in [projection] and the word jet come from the Latin
   root jactus, which means "throw." A jet plane throws itself — or
   projects itself — away from a central structure (the Earth) and into
   the air.

   adjective
   1. existing or occurring at or on the surface. "the building
      suffered only [superficial] damage"

   Anything [superficial] has to do with the surface of something. If
   you're judging a book by its cover, you're being [superficial]. People
   who worry too much about their clothes and hair may also be
   considered [superficial].

   The word [superficial] has to do with appearances and the surface. If
   a car is in an accident, but it only has a few scratches, you could
   say it has [superficial] damage, because the important parts are OK.
   If you just glance at a movie for a second, your opinion will be
   more [superficial] than the opinion of someone who watched the whole
   film closely. [Superficial] can have a negative flavor; calling
   someone [superficial] is saying that they are shallow and care too
   little about meaningful things.

   No reason to get excited — [cursory] has nothing to do with bad
   language. Instead, it means not paying attention to details, like
   friends who are so busy studying for a test that they only give your
   new haircut a [cursory] glance.

   [Cursory] dates to the early 17th century, from the French word
   cursoire meaning "rapid," which comes from the Latin word
   "cursorius," meaning "hasty, of a race or running." Something that
   is [cursory] is done quickly, like a teacher who takes a [cursory] look
   at a pile of completed tests, not to grade them, but to see if
   anyone attempted the bonus questions.

   2. cruel or severe. "a time of [harsh] military discipline"

   [Harsh] means severe or strict, particularly when referring to
   punishment. It would be a [harsh] punishment if you got grounded for
   two weeks just for coming home a little late for dinner.

   There are many shades of meaning for the word [harsh] depending on its
   context, but all imply that something is more unpleasant than it
   needs to be. [Harsh] lighting hurts your eyes. A [harsh] disciplinarian
   gives out punishments that are too severe. Whereas constructive
   criticism is usually helpful, a [harsh] critique will only make you
   upset. The [harsh] reality of the world today is that millions of
   people are starving while others have too much.

   [Parchment] is what people used to write on before paper was common,
   hundreds of years ago. Instead of being made from trees, [parchment]
   was made from animal skins.

   As early as the second century BC, ancient Greeks invented a method
   of treating animal skins to make a writing surface, [parchment], that
   was less expensive than the papyrus they used before that. [Parchment]
   continued to be used through the 1400s, when Europeans began making
   paper. These days, you're most likely to see [parchment] in a museum
   or historical movie. The word comes from the name of the city where
   it was invented, Pergamon.

Something that's droopy flops or sags limply. A droopy plant might
need water — or you might have watered it too much.

Your dog might have adorably droopy ears, especially if he's a hound
or a spaniel. You could also despair over your droopy hairdo,
especially if you intended for it to spring up in curls instead of
hanging limply down your back. You might also feel droopy after
running a race on a hot day. The original meaning of droopy was "sad
or gloomy," which most likely comes from the Old Norse drupr,
"drooping spirits."

   If you're looking for a formal adjective to describe something sly
   or secret, sneak in [furtive]. Let's hope the teacher doesn't see your
   [furtive] attempts to pass notes in class!

   The adjective, [furtive], is related to fūrtum, the Latin word for
   theft or robbery. This is apparent as the expressions "to give
   someone a [furtive] glance" and "to steal a glance at someone" mean
   the same thing. If a person's manner is [furtive], he or she is acting
   suspiciously. Secret, stealthy and sly are all similar in meaning,
   but they lack this image of a thief's actions.

   1. a thin decorative covering of fine wood applied to a coarser wood
      or other material. "Much of today's furniture is made with a thin
      wood [veneer] over a core of particleboard, and this material also
      will rapidly absorb water."

   verb
   1. cover (something) with a decorative layer of fine wood. "Hardwood
      [veneer]ed plywood, however, takes laser engraving very well."

   You know how some furniture looks like solid oak or maple until it
   gets chipped and reveals itself to be nothing more than some cheap
   particle-board covered with a thin layer of fancy wood? That thin
   layer is called a [veneer].

   A [veneer] can be anything that makes something look more elegant or
   attractive than it is. Originally it was a furniture word, but over
   time its meaning expanded. If someone smiles at you while making
   some passive-aggressive remark, like, "Gee, you actually look really
   nice today," you could say that her inner meanness is showing
   through her [veneer] of sweetness.

   Codd produced these rules as part of a personal campaign to prevent
   the vision of the original relational database from being diluted,
   as database vendors scrambled in the early 1980s to repackage
   existing products with a relational [veneer].

   Let's say your friend wants to go to the movies and you don't want
   to. Your friend might try to [entice] you by offering to buy you
   popcorn and a soda. [Entice] means to persuade with promises of
   something.

   The word [entice] means to lure or tempt someone by promising them
   something that they like. It is a little manipulative but in a
   fairly straightforward way. You always know it when someone is
   enticing you. If a company really wants to hire you, they will
   [entice] you with a good salary and generous benefits. The promise of
   a gold star is often enough to [entice] small children to get good
   grades.

   With that in mind, I want to examine what Solus 3 offers that might
   [entice] the regular user away from their current operating system.

   A [spot] is a particular place or a small, round mark. You might pick

   better place by the lake, get moving!

   [Spot]s on your face might be pimples—or maybe mosquito bites you got
   walking in a swampy [spot]. Another kind of [spot] is a small part of
   something, like the bright [spot] in your miserable day, or the bald
   [spot] on someone’s head. [Spot] is also shorthand for "[spot]light" and
   slang for money, as in "He handed me a ten [spot]." To [spot] something
   is to see it: "When you [spot] the ice cream truck, call me!"

   That conclusion would be [spot] on.

   verb
   1. feel deep respect or admiration for (something). "Cézanne's still
      lifes were [revered] by his contemporaries"

   If someone is [revered], it means he or she is held in deep respect
   and devotion. Religious leaders, saints, and martyrs are often
   considered as [revered]. Celebrities? Not so much. There's a touch of
   the other worldly about [revered].

   The origins of [revered] reveal something about its slightly scary,
   awesome nature. It comes from the Latin word revereri, meaning "to
   fear," and the addition of the "re" at the beginning is an
   expression of intensive force, so the word literally means "to
   greatly fear." People whom are [revered] are not necessarily those we
   feel most comfortable around; we are too busy holding them in awe.

   When you [enshrine] something, it means you are creating a shrine
   around it, or you are giving it its own protected [revered] space.

   A [quip] — a short, witty comment — can be pleasant, wise, or
   sarcastic, but usually carries an element of humor.

   A [quip], often taken as a sign of cleverness, is a witty remark that
   sounds spur-of-the-moment. A successful [quip] must sound offhand, as
   though it were an afterthought, even if the speaker has been honing
   the statement for days. Dorothy Parker was a famous writer known for
   her quick [quip]s, such as, "The best way to keep children home is to
   make the home atmosphere pleasant — and let the air out of the

   a short [quip] followed by a long groan."

   noun
   1. a wheel with a grooved rim around which a cord passes. It acts to
      change the direction of a force applied to the cord and is
      chiefly used (typically in combination) to raise heavy weights.
      "Prior to World War II, the sash (the parts that move) was
      counterweighted by a temperamental arrangement of cords, [pulley]s
      and iron weights."

   verb
   1. hoist with a [pulley]. "It's like being on a boat, sleeping on the
      bus, waking, buying a lift ticket, being [pulley]ed up the
      mountain, the payoff, the floating dance of linked telemark
      turns."

   A [pulley] is a basic device or machine made of a wheel with a rim
   that a cord or rope fits around. The wheel and axle of a [pulley] make
   it easier to lift heavy objects with the rope.

   Ships and sailboats use [pulley]s — though they're often called drums
   — to make raising the sails less difficult. Flagpoles also have
   [pulley]s for raising and lowering the flag, many garage doors work by
   a [pulley] system, and loading docks and constructions sites use
   [pulley]s for lifting heavy things. [Pulley] comes from the Old French
   polie, with a Greek root of polidion, or "little pivot."

   [Attendance] has to do with being present at something, like work or
   school. If you never miss a day, you have perfect [attendance].

   The concept of [attendance] has to do with showing up: if you show up
   for school, then your [attendance] is not in question. When people
   miss school or work, they usually need a note from a doctor,
   explaining why they weren't in [attendance]. We can also say "The
   [attendance] was 100" if 100 people showed up to a meeting. If only
   three people out of 100 showed up though, you'd say, "Wow.
   [Attendance] was terrible."

   among its members in Congress or Parliament, especially so as to
   ensure [attendance] and voting in debates.

   verb
   1. win a victory over (someone) in a battle or other contest;
      overcome or beat. "Arab armies [defeat]ed the Byzantine garrison"

   [Defeat] is the opposite of victory. When you lose, you suffer [defeat].
   When you win, you [defeat] your enemy.

   This is a word that's all about losing. In World War II, America and
   the Allies [defeat]ed the Axis powers: we beat them. In basketball,
   Michael Jordan usually [defeat]ed his opponents. Any loss can be
   called a [defeat]. When you're disappointed or think that nothing is

   could say, "I won't accept [defeat]!" Some people are so stubborn that
   even though they've obviously been [defeat]ed, they won't admit
   [defeat].

    Fairness is the quality of making judgments that are free from
    discrimination. Judges, umpires, and teachers should all strive to
    practice fairness.

    Fairness comes from the Old English fæger, meaning "pleasing,
    attractive." This makes sense given that the word is also used to
    describe physical beauty. Fairness can refer to someone's good
    looks, or if someone is very pale and blond, you might notice the
    fairness of her complexion. When someone shows fairness is making a
    decision, he is pleasing all parties involved and offering a
    solution that is attractive to everyone.

   Surprise! [Improper] is the opposite of proper. Something that’s
   [improper] goes against what people think is right. This could be a
   matter of politeness. For example, not giving up your seat for an
   elderly person is [improper]. Or it could be more serious, like going
   to school with no pants on. It could also be something uncool like
   meeting your best friend’s boyfriend for coffee without telling her.
   All [improper] things are wrong in someone's eyes.

   [Unjust] behavior is [improper] or dishonest: "The professor acted in
   an [unjust] manner when he gave everyone an F just because there was
   a rumor that his students didn’t like him."

   so harsh that it feels like you've been burned. If your best friend

   Sometimes, though, a negative quality gets the focus, as in "his bad

      "don't allow impatience to tempt you into overexposure and

   To tempt is to lure or entice. You might tempt your runaway dog back
   inside with pieces of cheese.

   The verb tempt often has negative implications: "Don't let those
   bullies tempt you into picking on smaller kids!" When something
   tempts you, it's often with the knowledge that it's not the best
   idea, however attractive it might be. Tempt was originally a
   religious term, meaning "to entice to evil or sin," while today it's
   more likely to be a slice of cake that tempts us than the devil.

   verb
   1. give a slight involuntary grimace or shrinking movement of the
      body out of or in anticipation of pain or distress. "he [wince]d at
      the disgust in her voice"

   A [wince] is a facial or bodily expression of pain, disgust, or
   regret. Think of something you've done that was really, really
   embarrassing or dumb: now feel your face or take a look in the
   mirror as you [wince] at the uncomfortable memory.

   A moment of pain or a recollection of something painful can make you
   [wince]. It's hard not to have a physical response or a [wince] with a
   bad memory or a hurt. And [wince] is both a verb and a noun, so it can
   be an action or a result. Sometimes people don’t do anything or have
   any physical pain, but they [wince] in discomfort at what someone else
   does or says, as when no one laughs after a really inappropriate
   joke.

   [mocking] [hostility||enmity] in his voice made her [wince]"

   adjective
   1. deserving or inviting derision or mockery; absurd. "when you
      realize how [ridiculous] these scenarios are, you will have to
      laugh"

   Did you just say that you could toss a rubber chicken over an ocean?
   Don’t be [ridiculous], because [ridiculous] words are hard to believe,
   and they will make others laugh at you, not always in a good way
   either.

   The adjective [ridiculous] comes from the Latin word ridere, which
   means “to laugh,” but it’s also related to the word ridicule, which
   means to mock in a cruel way. A mocking and cruel laughter, that’s a
   common reaction to [ridiculous] situations. However, there are all

   1. expressing contempt or ridicule. "a harsh, [derisive] laugh"

   Use the adjective [derisive] to describe something or someone that
   mocks, expresses contempt, or ridicules. You may sometimes catch
   your kids making [derisive] comments — especially if you ask them to
   do chores instead of whatever they think is more important.

   [Derisive] comes from the Latin word deridere, meaning "to ridicule,"
   and is from the roots de-, which means "down," and ridere, which
   means "to laugh." The adjective derisory comes from the same Latin
   word, but it has a different sense. If you say something [derisive],
   you show contempt or ridicule, as in a [derisive] glare at your noisy
   neighbors. If you say something is derisory, you mean it invites or
   deserves ridicule or contempt, especially if it is laughably small,
   such as a derisory diamond chip in an engagement ring.

   making fun of someone or something in a cruel way; [derisive].

   An [impediment] is anything that slows or blocks progress. It can
   refer to a physical thing, like a fallen tree in the road, or
   something more intangible, like how piracy is an [impediment] to the
   pleasure cruise industry in Somalia.

   See the pedi in there? Pedi means "feet" and hundreds of years ago,
   the word [impediment] referred to shackling one's feet. Now its use
   has broadened considerably. [Impediment] is something that blocks or
   impedes your path. There's no end to the things in your life that
   can be considered [impediment]s: your small bank account, your
   terrible childhood, your country's economic malaise — any one of
   these could be considered an [impediment] in your quest for happiness.

   It was unfortunate that, owing to a slight [impediment] due to

   to refer to something that cannot be altered, and then in the
   twentieth century — after [adamant] had been in English for about a
   thousand years — it came to be used as an adjective to mean
   "unyielding as stone." If you're [adamant] about something, no amount

   verb
   1. refuse to accept or be associated with. "she has [repudiate]d
      policies associated with previous party leaders"

   To [repudiate] something is to reject it, or to refuse to accept or
   support it. If you grow up religious, but [repudiate] all organized
   religion as an adult, you might start spending holidays at the
   movies, or just going to work.

   This verb usually refers to rejecting something that has authority,
   such as a legal contract, doctrine, or claim. In connection with
   debts or other obligations, [repudiate] is used in the specialized
   sense "to refuse to recognize or pay." If referring to a child or a
   lover, [repudiate] is used in the sense "to disown, cast off." This
   verb is derived from Latin repudiare "to put away, divorce."

   The Old French root of [disdainfully] is desdeignier, "scorn,
   refuse, or [repudiate]," from des, "do the opposite of," and deignier,
   "treat with respect."

   noun
   1. contemptuous ridicule or mockery. "my stories were greeted with
      [derision] and disbelief"

   If people are laughing at you, making fun of you, and acting as if
   you're worthless, they're treating you with [derision]. [Derision] is
   mean and attacking — it's a form of contempt.

   [Derision] is more than just making fun of someone — it's mocking
   someone so forcefully and with such venom that you discredit the
   person completely. [Derision] can include literally laughing at
   someone or just treating a person like a joke. You know how
   celebrities and politicians do embarrassing things from time to
   time? They're usually treated with [derision] afterward: people mock
   them, treat them with contempt, and try to make the person who
   messed up seem completely worthless.

   feel or express contempt or [derision] for.
