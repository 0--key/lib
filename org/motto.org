       + The Pope is visiting Russia.
       + The Moon is very bright tonight.
       + The Shah of Iran was deposed in 1979.

	 really dangerous animals)

**** quantifiers
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     We use quantifiers when we want to give someone information about
     the number of something: how much or how many.
     #+END_QUOTE

     Sometimes we use a quantifier in the  place of a determiner:
     - Most children start school at the age of five.
     - We ate some bread and butter.
     - We saw lots of birds.
	
     We use these quantifiers with both count and uncount nouns:
     | all  | any  | enough | less    | a lot of | lots of |
     | more | most | no     | none of | some     |         |

     and some more colloquial forms:
     | plenty of | heaps of | a load of | loads of | tons of | etc |

     some quantifiers can be used only with count nouns:
     | both | each | either | (a) few | fewer | neither | several |

     and some more colloquial forms:
     | a couple of | hundreds of | thousands of | etc |

     some quantifiers can be used only with uncount nouns:
     | a little | (not) much | a bit of | 

     and, particularly with abstract nouns such as time, money, trouble,
     etc:, we often use:
     | a great deal of | a good deal of | 

     Members of groups
      
     You can put a noun after a quantifier when you are talking about
     members of a group in general:
     - Few snakes are dangerous.
     - Both brothers work with their father.
     - I never have enough money.

     ...but if you are talking about a specific group of people or things,
     use of the... as well:
     - Few of the snakes are dangerous.
     - All of the children live at home.
     - He has spent all of his money.

     Note that, if we are talking about two people or things we use
     quantifiers both, either and neither.
     | One supermarket | Two supermarkets     | More than two supermarkets |
     |-----------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
     | The supermarket | Both supermarkets    | All the supermarkets were  |
     | was closed      | were closed.         | closed.                    |
     |-----------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
     | The supermarket | Neither of the       | None of the supermarkets   |
     | wasn't open.    | supermarkets was     | were open.                 |
     |                 | open.                |                            |
     |-----------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
     | I don't think   | I don't think either | I don't think any of the   |
     | the supermarket | of the supermarkets  | supermarkets were open.    |
     | was open.       | was open.            |                            | 

     & Nouns with either and neither have a singular verb.

     Singular quantifiers:

     We use every or each with a singular noun to mean all:
     | There was a party in every street      | = | There were parties in all the streets      |
     |----------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------|
     | Every shop was decorated with          |   | All the shops were decorated with          |
     | flowers                                | = | flowers.                                   |
     |----------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------|
     | Each child was given a prize.          | = | All the children were given a prize.       |
     |----------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------|
     | There was a prize in each competition. | = | There were prizes in all the competitions. |

     We often use every to talk about times like days, weeks and years:
     - When we were children we had holidays at our grandmother's every year.
     - When we stayed at my grandmother's house we went to the beach every day.
     - We visit our daughter every Christmas.

     BUT: We do not use a determiner with every and each. We DO NOT say:
     -- The every shop was decorated with flowers.
     -- The each child was given a prize.

     Activities:

     - Could you dive me some advice?
     - There are only a few players in the world with his skill.
     - Every year I promise myself I will lose some weight.
     - When I got there both the banks had closed.
     - Can you give me a couple of pounds for the bus fare?
     - I went to a great deal of trouble to get those tickets.
     - Either that dog goes or I do!

*** Possessives [100%]
**** nouns
     We use a noun with 's with a singular noun show possession:
     - We are having a party at John's house.
     - Michael drove his friend's car.
	
     We use s' with plural noun ending in -s:
     - This is my parents' house.
     - Those are ladies' shoes.

     But we use 's with other plural nouns:
     - These are men's shoes.
     - Children's clothes are very expensive.

     We can use a possessive instead of a noun phrase to avoid repeating
     words:
     | Is that John's car? | No, it's Mary's [car]. |
     |---------------------+------------------------|
     | Whose coat is this? | It's my wife's [coat]. |

     - for parts of the body:

    Most adjectives can be used in front of a noun:
    - They have a beautiful house.
    - We saw a very exciting film last night.

    or after a link verb like be, look and feel:
    - Their house is beautiful.
    - That film looks interesting.

    Examples:
    - I saw a really good program me on TV last night.
    - My sister's got two young children.
    - I didn't know your mother was French.
    - Are you OK? You look terrible!
    - I've just bought a new printer.
    - This chicken doesn't smell very good. How old is it?
    - They're building a big factory next to our home.
    - Poland can be a very cold country in the winter.
    - Sorry, can you stop the car? I feel sick.
    - I'd like to see than new Michael Moore film. It sounds
      interesting.
**** adjectives: -ed and -ing
     A lot of adjectives are made from verbs by adding -ing or -ed:
     - ing adjectives:
       the commonest -ing adjectives are:
       + amusing
       + shocking
       + surprising
       + frightening
       + interesting
       + disappointing
	  
     If you call something interesting you mean it interests you.
     If you call something frightening you mean it frightening you.

     Examples:
     - I read very interesting article in the newspaper today.
     - That Dracula film was absolutely terrifying.
	
     -ed adjectives:

     The commonest -ed adjectives are:
     + annoyed
     + bored
     + frightened
     + worried
     + tried

       If something annoys you, you can say you feel annoyed. If something
       interests you, you can say you are interested.

       Example:
       - The children had nothing to do. They are bored.

**** order of adjectives
     Sometimes we use more than one adjective in front of a noun:
     - He was a nice intelligent young man.
     - She had a small round black wooden box.

     Opinion adjectives:

     Some adjectives give a general opinion. we can use these adjectives to
     describe almost any noun:

     | good      | bad       | lovely | strange   | beautiful | nice  |
     |-----------+-----------+--------+-----------+-----------+-------|
     | brilliant | excellent | awful  | important | wonderful | nasty | 

     Some adjectives give a specific opinion. We only use these adjectives
     to describe particular kinds of noun:
     - Food:
       + tasty
       + delicious
     - Furniture, buildings:
       + comfortable
       + uncomfortable
     - People, animals:
       + clever
       + friendly
       + intelligent

     We usually put a general opinion in front of a specific opinion:
     - Nice tasty soup.
     - A nasty uncomfortable armchair.
     - A lovely intelligent animal.

     Usually we put an adjective that gives an opinion in front of an adjective
     that is descriptive:
     - a nice red dress;
     - a silly old man;
     - those horrible yellow curtains

     We often have two adjectives in front of a noun:
     - a handsome young man;
     - a big black car;
     - that horrible big dog

     Sometimes we have three adjectives, but it is unusual:
     - a nice handsome young man;
     - a big black American car;
     - that horrible big fierce dog

     It is very unusual to have more than three adjectives.

     Adjectives usually come in this order:

     | 1       | 2        |    3 |     4 |   5 |      6 |           7 |        8 |
     |---------+----------+------+-------+-----+--------+-------------+----------|
     | General | Specific | Size | Shape | Age | Colour | Nationality | Material |
     | opinion | opinion  |      |       |     |        |             |          |

     We use some adjectives only after a link verb:

     | afraid | alive | alone | asleep | content | glad |
     |--------+-------+-------+--------+---------+------|
     | ill    | ready | sorry | sure   | unable  | well |

     Some of the commonest -ed adjectives are normally used only after a
     link verb:
     - annoyed;
     - finished;
     - bored;
     - pleased;
     - thrilled

     We say:
     - Our teacher was ill.
     - My uncle was very glad when he heard the news.
     - The policeman seemed to be very annoyed.

     A few adjectives are used only in front of a noun:
     | north | northern | countless  | eventful |
     | south | southern | occasional | indoor   |
     | east  | eastern  | lone       | outdoor  |
     | west  | western  |            |          |

     We say:
     - He lives in the eastern district.
     - There were countless problems with the new machinery.

**** comparative and superlative adjectives
     We use comparative adjectives to describe people and things:
     - This car is certainly better but it's much more expensive.
     - I'm feeling happier now.
     - We need a bigger garden.

     We use than when we want to compare one thing with another:
     - She us two years older than me.
     - New York is much bigger than Boston.
     - He is a better player than Ronaldo.
     - France is a bigger country than Britain.

     When we want to describe how something or someone changes we can
     use two comparatives with and:
     - The balloon got bigger and bigger.
     - Everything is getting more and more expensive.
     - Grandfather is looking older and older.

     We often use the with comparative adjectives to show that one
     thing depends on another:
     - When you drive faster it is more dangerous.
       + The faster you drive, the more dangerous it is.
     - When they climbed higher it got colder.
       + The higher they climbed, the colder it got.

     Superlative adjectives:

     We use the with a superlative:
     - It was the happiest day of my life.
     - Everest is the highest mountain in the world.
     - That's the best film I've seen this year.
     - I have three sisters, Jan is the oldest and Angela is the youngest.

**** intensifiers

     We use words like very, really and extremely to make adjectives
     stronger:
     - It's a very interesting story.
     - Everyone was very excited.
     - It's a really interesting story.
     - Everyone was extremely excited.

     We call these words intensifiers. Other intensifiers are:

     | amazingly  | exceptionally | incredibly |
     |------------+---------------+------------|
     | remarkably | particularly  | unusually  |

     We also use enough to say more about an adjective, but enough comes
     after its adjective:
     - If you are seventeen you are old enough to drive a car.
     - I can't wear those shoes. They're not big enough.

     Intensifiers with strong adjectives:

     Strong adjectives are words like:

     | enormous, huge             | very big    |
     |----------------------------+-------------|
     | tiny                       | very small  |
     |----------------------------+-------------|
     | brilliant                  | very clever |
     |----------------------------+-------------|
     | awful, terrible,           |             |
     | disgusting, dreadful       | very bad    |
     |----------------------------+-------------|
     | certain                    | very sure   |
     |----------------------------+-------------|
     | excellent, perfect, ideal, |             |
     | wonderful, splendid        | very good   |
     |----------------------------+-------------|
     | delicious                  | very tasty  |

     We do not use very with these adjectives.
     With strong adjectives, we normally use intensifiers like:

     | absolutely | completely    | totally      | utterly |
     |------------+---------------+--------------+---------|
     | really     | exceptionally | particularly | quite   | 

     - The film was absolutely awful.
     - He was an exceptionally brilliant child.
     - The food smelled really disgusting.

     Advanced:

     Some intensifiers go with particular adjectives depending on
     the meaning of the adjective:

     - I’m afraid your wife is dangerously ill.
     - He was driving dangerously fast.
     - The car was seriously damaged.
     - Fortunately none of the passengers was seriously hurt.

     Some intensifiers go with particular adjectives. For example we
     use the intensifier highly with the adjectives successful,
     intelligent, likely and unlikely:

     - He was highly intelligent.
     - She’s a highly successful businesswoman

     but we do not say:

     - We had a highly tasty meal.
     - That is a highly good idea.

     We use the intensifier bitterly with the adjectives disappointed,
     unhappy and cold:

     - I was bitterly unhappy at school.
     - We were bitterly disappointed to lose the match.
     - It can get bitterly cold in winter.

     Activities:

     - My mother was a highly successful tennis player in her time. She
       won loads of tournaments.
     - The car was so seriously damaged in the  accident that it had to be
       scrapped.
     - Tom was deliriously happy when he heard he'd become a grandfather.
       He can't stop smiling.
     - I was deeply disappointed by my team's performance last night.
       It was terrible.
     - The restaurant was shut down when three people fell gravely ill
       after eating there.
     - Esther's desperately unhappy working at the bank so she's looking
       for a new job.
     - In order to be a successful detective, you need to be keenly
       observant.
     - Have I met Maria's new boyfriend? No, but I've seen him and he's
       drop-dead gorgeous!
     - Professor Jones was a universally popular head of department.
       Everyone was truly sorry to see him retire.
     - The government is firmly committed to reducing public debt, and
       is therefore bitterly opposed to any increases.  

     You need to use your dictionary to find what sort of nouns these
     intensifiers go with.
**** mitigators

     Mitigators are the opposite of intensifiers. When we want to make
     an adjective less strong we use these words:

     | fairly | rather | quite |
     |--------+--------+-------|

     - By the end of the day we were rather tired.
     - The film wasn't great but it was quite exciting.

     and in informal English: pretty

     - We had a pretty good time at the party.

     We call these words mitigators

     | WARNING                                                     |
     |-------------------------------------------------------------|
     | quite                                                       |
     |-------------------------------------------------------------|
     | When we use quite with a strong adjective it means the same |
     | as absolutely:                                              |
     | - The food was quite awful = The food was absolutely awful. |
     | - As a child he was quite brilliant = absolutely brilliant. |

***** Mitigators with comparatives:

      We use these words and phrases as mitigators:

      - a bit
      - just a bit
      - a little
      - a little bit
      - just a little bit
      - rather
      - slightly

      - She's a bit younger than I am.
      - It takes two hours on the train but it is a little bit longer by
	road.
      - This one is rather bigger (then the other one)

      We use a slightly and rather as mitigators with comparative
      adjectives in front of a noun:

      - This is a slightly more expensive model than that one.
      - This is a rather bigger one than the other.

***** Adjectives as intensifiers:

      We use some adjectives as intensifiers:

      - absolute
      - total - complete
      - utter - perfect
      - real

      We say:

      - He's a complete idiot.
      - They were talking utter nonsense.

***** Activities:

      - It was after midnight and the children were rather tired.
      - My first trip by airplane was quite exciting.

      - My brother has become a fairly successful businessman.
      - Cinema tickets are a bit more expensive on Saturdays.
      - Julia is just a little older than her twin sister.

**** noun modifiers
     We often use two nouns together to show that one thing is a part
     of something else:

     - the village church
     - the car door
     - the kitchen window
     - the chair leg
     - my coat pocket
     - London residents

     Warning!
     We do not use a possessive form for these things. We do not talk
     about:

     - the car's door
     - the kitchen's window
     - the chair's leg

     We can use noun modifiers to show what something is made of:

     - a gold watch
     - a leather purse
     - a metal box

     We often use noun modifiers with nouns ending in -er and -ing:

     - an office worker
     - a jewelry maker
     - a potato peeler
     - a shopping list
     - a swimming lesson
     - a walking holiday

     We use measurements, age or value as noun modifiers:

     - a thirty kilogram suitcase
     - a two minute rest
     - a five thousand euro platinum watch
     - a fifty kilometer journey

     We often put two nouns together and reader/listener have work out
     what they mean. So:

     - an ice bucket = a bucket to keep ice in
     - an ice cube = a cube made of ice
     - an ice breaker = a ship which breaks ice
     - the ice age = the time when much of the Earth was covered in ice

     Sometimes we find more than two nouns together:

     London office worker; grammar practice exercises

***** Position of noun modifiers
      Noun modifiers come after adjectives

      - The old newspaper seller
      - A tiring fifty kilometer journey

*** Adverbials [100%]
**** Why do we use adverbials
     We use adverbs to give more information about the verb.

     We use adverbials of manner to say how something happens or how
     something is done:

     - The children were playing happily.
     - He was driving as fast as possible.

     We use adverbials of place to say where something happens:

     - I saw him there.
     - We met in London.

     We use adverbials of time to say when or how often something happens:

     - They start work at six thirty.
     - They usually go to work by bus.

     We use adverbials of probability to show how certain we are about
     something:

     - Perhaps the weather will be fine.
     - He is certainly coming to the party.

**** how we make adverbials
      
***** An adverbial can be an adverb:

      - He spoke angrily.
      - They live here.
      - We will be back soon.

***** or an adverb with an intensifier:

      - He spoke really andgry.
      - They live just here.
      - We will go quite soon.
      - We will go as soon as possible.

***** or a phrase with a preposition:

      - He spoke in an angry voice.
      - They live in London.
      - We will go in a few minutes.

***** Activities:

      - They behaved very badly.
      - He went upstairs.
      - They stopped at the end of the street.
      - The water rose extremely quickly.
      - He's on the phone.
      - It opens automatically.

**** where do adverbials go in a sentence
***** We normally put adverbials /after the verb/:

      - He spoke angrily.
      - They live just here.
      - We will go in a few minutes.

***** or after the /object/ or /complement/:

      - He opened the door quietly.
      - She left the money on the table.
      - We saw our friends last night.
      - You are looking tired tonight.

***** But adverbials of /frequency/ (how often) usually come /in front
      of/ the main verb:

      - We usually spent our holidays with our grandparents.
      - I have never seen William at work.

***** But if we want to emphasise an adverbial we can put it at the
      /beginning/ of a clause:

      - Last night we saw our friends.
      - In a few minutes we will go.
      - Very quietly he opened the door.

***** If we want to emphasise an /adverb of manner/ we can put it
      in front of the main verb:

      - He quietly opened the door.
      - She had carefully put the glass on the shelf.

***** Activities

      - The builders are working =really slow=.
	When will they be finished?
      - Liam lived in Paris for a year so he speaks French
	=quite well=.
      - We're good friends with our neighbours.
	We =often invite= them for dinner.
      - =In my coat pocket= you'll find a bottle of tablets.
	Can you go and get them?

	journalists' questions.

	really important things like the World Cup.
      - There is plenty of food and drink =in the kitchen=.
	Please help yourself.
      - Hillary went into a cafe and =quickly ordered= a cup of coffee.
**** adverbs of manner
     Adverbs of manner are usually formed from adjectives by adding -ly:

     - bad > badly
     - quiet > quietly
     - recent > recently
     - sudden > suddenly

     but there are sometimes changes in spelling:

     - easy > easily
     - gentle > gently

     If adjective ends in -ly we use the phrase in a ... way to
     express manner

     - Silly > He behaved in a silly way.
     - Friendly > She spoke in a friendly way.

     A few adverbs of manner have the same form as the adjective:

     - They all worked hard.
     - She usually arrives late.
     - I hate driving fast.

     *Note:* /hardly/ and /lately/ have different meanings:

     - He could hardly walk = It was /difficult/ for him to walk.
     - I haven't seen John lately = I haven't seen John /recently/.

     We often use phrases with like as adverbials manner:

     - She slept like a baby.
     - He ran like a rabbit.

***** Adverbs of manner and link verbs
      We very often use /adverbials/ with /like/ after link verbs:

      - Her hands felt like ice.
      - It smells like fresh bread.

      But we do not use other adverbials of manner after link verbs.
      We use adjectives instead:

      - They looked +happily+ happy.
      - That bread smells +deliciously+ delicious.

      Activities:

      - Do you have to drive so fast. You're making me nervous.
      - Have you ever eaten frogs' legs? They say it tastes like chicken.
      - I lived in Cairo for more than ten years. I know it like the

      - Is Mary angry with me? She didn't say hello in a very friendly way.
      - Let's get the later bus, at 10.45. We don't want to arrive to the
	airport too early.

	fridge?
      - Why he dancing in that silly way? Is he trying to be funny?
      - You can always tell what Rod is thinking. You can read him like
	a book.
      - You look very bad! What time did you go to bed last night?

      something is moving.

      - Walk past the bank and keep going to the end of the street.

**** superlative adverbs

     - His ankles hurt badly, but his knees hurt *worst*.
     - It rains *most often* at the beginning of the year.


***** Intensifiers

      front of the adverb, and we use these words and phrases as
      intensifiers:

*** Nouns
**** Count nouns
     Count nouns have two forms: *singular* and *plural*.

     Singular count nouns refer to one person or thing:
     - a /book/
     - a /teacher/
     - a /wish/
     - an /idea/

     Plural count nouns refer to more than one person or thing:
     - /books/
     - /teachers/
     - /wishes/
     - /ideas/

***** Singular count nouns
      Singular count nouns *cannot be used alone*. They must
      have a _determiner_:
      - the book
      - that English teacher
      - a wish
      - my latest idea

***** Plural forms
      We usually add /-s/ to make a plural noun:
      - book > books
      - school > schools
      - friend > friends

      We add /-es/ to nouns ending in /-ss/; /-ch/; /-s/; /-sh/; /-x/
      - class > classes
      - watch > watches
      - gas > gases
      - wish > wishes
      - box > boxes

      When a noun ends in a *consonant* and /-y/ we make the plural
      in /-ies/
      - lady > ladies
      - country > countries
      - party > parties

      _but_ if a noun ends in a *vowel* and /-y/ we simply add /-s/:
      - boy > boys
      - day > days
      - play > plays

      Some common nouns have *irregular plurals*:
      - man > men
      - woman > women
      - child > children
      - foot > feet
      - person > people

      Plural count nouns do *not* have a /determiner/ then they refer
      to people or things as a /group/:
      - Computers are very expensive.
      - Do you sell old books?

***** Activities

      - The most interesting countries I have visited are in Asia.

**** Uncount nouns
     Some nouns in English are *uncount* nouns.
     We do use uncount nouns in the plural and we do not use
     them with the indefinite article, a/an.
     - We ate a lot of food.
     - We bought some new furniture.
     - That's useful information.

     We can use *some quantifiers* with uncount nous:
     - He gave me *some useful advice*.
     - They gave us a *lot of information*.

     Uncount nouns often refer to:
     - *Substances*:

       - water;
       - wine;

***** Common uncount nouns
      There are some common nouns in English, like /accommodation/,
      which are count nouns even though they have plurals in other
      languages:

      | advice    | baggage | equipment | furniture | homework | information |
      | knowledge | luggage | machinery | money     | news     | traffic     |

      - Let me give you *some advice*.
      - *How much luggage* have you got?

      If we want to make these things countable, we use *expressions* like:

      | a piece of... | a pieces of... | a bit of... |
      | bits of...    | an item of...  | items of... |

      - Let me give you *a piece of* advice.
      - That's *a* useful *piece of* equipment.
      - We bought *a few bits* of furniture for the new apartment.
      - She had six separate *items of* luggage.

      *but* we do not use /accommodation/, /money/ and /traffic/ in this way.

**** Common problems
      
***** Uncount nouns used as count nouns
      Although substanses are usually *uncount* nouns...
      - Would you like some *cheese*?
      - *Coffee* keeps me awake at night.
      - *Wine* makes me sleep.

      ...they can be *also* used as *count* nouns:

      - George had *hopes* of promotion.

      - *Travel* is a great teacher.
      - Where did you go on your *travels*?

      - His life was in *danger*.
      - There is a serious *danger* of fire.

      - Linguistics is the study of *language*.
      - Is English a difficult *language*?

***** Uncount nouns that end in /-s/
      Some uncount nouns end in /-s/ so they like plurals even though
      they are singular nouns.

      These nouns generally refer to:

      | Subjects of study | mathematics, physics, economics |
      | Activities        | gymnastics, athletics           |
      | Games             | cards, darts, billiards         |

***** Group nouns
      Some nouns like /army/, refer to groups of people, animals or
      things, we can use them *either* as singular nouns *or* as
      plural nouns:

      - I have a large family. They are very dear to me.
      - The government is very unpopular.
      - The government are always changing their minds.

      Sometimes we think of the group as a single thing:

      - The audience always enjoys the show.
      - The group consists of two men and three women.

      Sometimes we think of the group as several individuals:

      - The audience clapped their hands.
      - The largest group are the boys.

      The names of many organisations and teams are also group nouns,
      but they are *usually plural* in spoken English:

      - Barcelona are winning 2-0.
      - The _United Oil Company_ are putting prices up by 12%.

***** Two-part nouns
      A few plural nouns, like /binoculars/, refer to things that
      have two parts.

      | glasses  | jeans    | knickers | pincers    | pants  | pliers   |
      | pyjamas  | scissors | shorts   | spectacles | tights | trainers |
      | trousers | tweezers |          |            |        |          |

      - These *binoculars* were very expensive.
      - The trousers are too long.

      we use /a pair of/...

      - I've bought *a pair of* blue jeans.

      If we want to talk about more than one, we use /pairs of/...

      - Can you lend me some scissors?

     Names of people, places and organisations are called *proper nouns*.
     We spell proper nouns with a *capital letter*:

     - Mohammed Ali
     - Birmingham

     We use capital letters for *festivals*:

     use capital letters for the *nouns*, *adjectives* and *verbs* in
     the name:

     - Beatrix Potter wrote 'The Tail of Peter Rabbit'.

**** Question forms
     We make questions by:

***** moving an auxiliary to the front of the clause:
      | Everybody /is/ watching                | >> | /Is/ everybody watching?                |
      | They /had/ worked hard                 | >> | /Had/ they worked hard?                 |
      | He'/s/ finished work                   | >> | /Has/ he finished work?                 |
      | Everybody /had/ been working hard      | >> | /Had/ everybody been working hard?      |
      | He /has/ been singing                  | >> | /Has/ he been singing?                  |
      | English /is/ spoken all over the world | >> | /Is/ English spoken all over the world? |
      | The windows /have/ been cleaned        | >> | /Have/ the windows been cleaned?        |

***** by moving a modal to the front of the clause:
      | They /will/ come                 | >> | /Will/ they come?                 |
      | He /might/ come                  | >> | /Might/ he come?                  |
      | They /will/ have arrived by now  | >> | /Will/ they have arrived by now?  |
      | She /would/ have been listening  | >> | /Would/ she have been listening?  |
      | The work /will/ be finished soon | >> | /Will/ the work be finished soon? |
      | They /might/ been invited to the |    | /Might/ they been invited to the  |
      | party                            | >> | party?                            |

***** The *present simple* and the *past simple* have *no* auxiliary. We
      make questions by *adding* the auxiliary _do//does_ to the present
      simple or _did_ for the past simple:
      | They live here    | >> | /Do/ they live here?   |
      | John live/s/ here | >> | /Does/ John live here? |
      | Everybody laughed | >> | /Did/ everybody laugh? |

**** Verb phrases
     The verb phrase in English has the following forms:

***** a main verb
      | We        | are     | here.         |
      | I         | like    | it.           |
      | Everybody | saw     | the accident. |
      | We        | laughed |               | 

      The verb may be in the present tense /(are, like)/ or the past tenses
      /(saw, laughed)/. A verb phrase with only a main verb expresses
      *simple aspect*
       
***** an *auxiliary verb ("be")* and a main verb in /-ing/ form
      | Everybody | is   | watching |
      | We        | were | laughing |

      A verb phrase with "be" and /-ing/ expresses *continuous aspect*.

***** an *auxiliary verb ("have")* and a *main verb with past participle*
      | They      | have | enjoyed  | themselves. |
      | Everybody | has  | worked   | hard.       |
      | He        | had  | finished | work.       |

      A verb with "have" and the past participle expresses *perfect aspect*.
      A verb with /have//has/ expresses *present perfect*, and a verb with
      /had/ expresses *past perfect*.

***** an *auxiliary verb ("have" + "been")* and a *main verb in the /-ing/ form*
      | Everybody | has been | working  | hard. |
      | He        | had been | singing. |       |

      A verb with "have" and "been" and the present participle expresses
      *perfect continuous aspect*. A verb with /have//has/ expresses
      *present perfect continuous*, and a verb with /had/ expresses
      *past perfect continuous*.

***** a *modal verb* (can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would)
      and a *main verb*
      | They | will  | come. |
      | He   | might | come. |

***** We can use *modal verbs* with the auxiliaries *"be"*, *"have"* and
      *"have been"*
      | They | will  | be        | listening. |
      | He   | might | have      | arrived.   |
      | She  | must  | have been | listening. |

**** Present tense
     There are two tenses in English - past and present.
     The present tenses in English are used:
     - to talk about the *present*
     - to talk about the *future*
     - to talk about the *past* when we are telling a story in *spoken*
       English or when we are summarizing a book, film, play etc.

       There are *four* present tense forms in English:

       | Tense                      | Form                |
       |----------------------------+---------------------|
       | Present simple             | I work              |
       | Present continuous         | I am working        |
       | Present perfect            | I have worked       |
       | Present perfect continuous | I have been working | 

     We use these forms:
     - to talk about the *present*:
       + He works at McDonald's. He *has worked* there for three months now.
       + He is working in McDonald's. He *has been working* there for three months now.
       + London *is* the capital of Britain.
     - to talk about the *future*:
       - The next train *leaves* this evening at 1700 hours.

     So I say to him, 'What's your game, son?'

     You look sad. Anything the matter?

***** present simple
      The present tense is the *base form* of the verb: I *work* in London.
      But the third person (she\he\it) adds an /-s/: She *work_s_* in London.

      *Use*
      We use present tense to talk about:

****** something that is true in the present:
       - I'*m* nineteen years old.
       - He *lives* in London.
       - I'*m* a student.

****** something that happens again and again in the present:
       - I *play* football every weekend.
       We use words like:
       *sometimes*
       *often*
       *always*
       *never* (adverbs of frequency)
       with the present tense:
       - I *sometimes* go to the cinema.
       - She *never* plays football.

****** something that is fixed in the future:
       - The school term *starts* next week.

       - Does Jack play football?
       - Where does he come from?
       - Do Rita and Angela live in Manchester?
       - Where do they work?

       With the present tense, we use *do* and *does* to make questions.
       We use *does* for the third person (she/he/it) and we use *do* for
       others.

       We use *do* and *does* with question words like *where*, *what* and
       *why*:

       But look at these questions with who:

       - Who lives in London?
       - Who plays football at the weekend?
       - Who works at Liverpool City Hospital?

       Look at these sentences:

       - I like tennis, but I don't like football.
       - I don't live in London now.
       - I don't play the piano, but I play the guitar.
       - They don't work at the weekend.
       - John doesn't live in Manchester.
       - Angela doesn't drive to work. She goes by bus.

       With the present tense we use *do* and *does* to make negatives.
       We use /does not/ (*doesn't*) for the third person (she/he/it) and
       we use /do not/ (*don't*) for the others.

***** present perfect
      The *present perfect* is formed from the present tense of the verb

      The present perfect *continuous* is formed with /have/has/ /been/
      and the /-ing/ form of the verb.

      *Use*

       *present*:
       - They'*ve been married* _for nearly fifty years_.

       - He *has been written* three books and he is working on another one.
       - I'*ve been watching* that programme every week.

       - I *have worked* here _since I left school_.
       - I'*ve been watching* that programme every week _since it started_.

       up to the present:
       - My last birthday was the worst day I *have ever had*.

       *Note*: and we use /never/ for the negative form:
       - *Have you ever met* George?
       - Yes, but I'*ve never met* his wife.

****** for something that happened in the past but is important at
       the time of speaking:

       - Teresa isn't at home. I think *she has gone* shopping.

	place and *returned*:
	A: Where *have you been*?
	B: I've *just been out to the supermarket*.

	A: *Have you ever been to* San Francisco?
	B: No, but *I've been* to Los Angeles.

******* But when someone *has not returned* we use */have/has/ gone*:
	A: Where is Maria? I haven't seen her for a weeks.
	B: *She's gone to* Paris for a week. _She'll back tomorrow_.

******* We often use the present perfect with *time adverbials* which
	refer to the *recent past*: /just, only just, recently/:
	- Scientists *have recently discovered* a new breed of monkey.
	- We *have just got* back from our holidays.

******* or adverbials which *include the present*:
	/ever/ (in questions);

	- *Where have you been* _up to now_?
	- *Have you finished* your homework _yet_?
	- No, _so far_ I'*ve* only *done* my history.

	refers to *past time* which is *finished*:
	- I have seen that film +yesterday+.
	- We have just bought a new car +last week+.
	- +When we were children+ we have been to California.

       - It was very dangerous. What if you *had get* lost?
       - I wish I *hadn't spent* so much money last month.

      *Use*

      We use the past tense to talk about:

****** something that happened *once in the past*:
       - I *met* my wife in 1983.
       - We *went* to Spain for our holidays.
       - They *got* home very late last night.

****** something that happened *again and again in the past*:
       - When I was a boy I *walked* a mile to school every day.
       - We *swam* a lot while we were on holiday.
       - They always *enjoyed* visiting their friends.

       - I *lived* abroad for ten years.
       - He *enjoyed* being a student.

****** we often use phrases with /ago/ with the past tense:

****** *Questions and negatives*
       We use /did/ to make questions with the past tense:
       - When *did you meet* your wife?
       - Where *did you go* for your holidays?
       - *Did she play* tennis when she was younger?
       - *Did you live* abroad?

       But look at these questions:
       - Who discovered penicillin?
       - Who wrote Don Quixote?

       We use *didn't* (did not) to make *negatives* with the past tense:
       - They *didn't go* to Spain this year.
       - We *didn't get* home until very late last night.
       - I *didn't see* you yesterday.

***** past continuous
      The past continuous is formed from the past tense of /be/ with
      the /-ing/ form of the verb.
      We use the past continuous to talk about the *past*:

****** for something which continued *before* and *after* another *action*:
       - The children *were doing their homework* when _I got home_.
	 Compare:
	 I got home. The children did their homework.
	 and
	 The children did their homework when I got home.
       - As I watching television the telephone rang.

       This use of the past continuous is very common at the beginning
       of a story:
       - The other day *I was waiting* for a bus when ...
       - Last week *as I was driving* to work ...

****** for something that happened *before* and *after* a *particular time*:

***** past perfect
      We use the verb /had/ and the *past participle* for the *past perfect*:
      - I *had finished* the work.
      - She *had gone*.

      The past perfect *continuous* is formed with /had been/ and /-ing/
      form of the verb:
      - I *had been* finish/ing/ the work.
      - *She had been* go/ing/.

      The past perfect is used in the same way as the present perfect,
      but it refers to a time in the past, not the present.

      We use the past perfect tense:
       
****** for something that started in the past and continued up to a
       given time in the past:
       - When George died he and Anne *had been married* for nearly
	 fifty years.
       - She didn't want to move. She *had lived* in Liverpool all
	 her life.

       We normally use the past perfect *continuous* for this:
       - She didn't want to move. She *had been living* in Liverpool
	 all her life.
       - Everything was wet. It *had been raining* for hours.


****** for something we had done *several times* up to the point in the
       past and *continued* to do after this point:

	 he was a teenager.
       - He *had written three* books and he was working on another one.
       - I *had been watching* the programme every week, but I missed
	 the last episode.

       We often use clause with /since/ to show when something started
       in the past:
       - They had been staying with us *since* _the previous week_.
       - I was sorry when the factory closed. I had worked there *since*
	 _I left school_.
       - I *had been watching* that programme every week *since* _it started_,
	 but I missed the last episode.

       - I was pleased to meet George. I hadn't met him before, even though
	 I had met his wife several times.

       time of reporting:
       - I couldn't get into my house. I *had lost* my keys.
       - Teresa wasn't at home. She *had gone* shopping.


****** we use the past perfect to talk about the past in *conditions*,
       *hypotheses* and *wishes*:J
       - I would have helped him _if_ *he had* asked.
       - It was very dangerous. _What if_ you *had got* lost?

       - He'd been working for the company since he graduated.
       - I wish you'd told me earlier.


**** Perfective aspect

      up to the present:
      - They'*ve been* married for nearly fifty years.
      - She *has lived* in Liverpool all her life.


***** ...or is important in the present:
      - I'*ve lost* my keys. I can't get into the house.

      at some time *in the future*:
      - In a few years they *will have discovered* a cure for the common cold.
      - I can come out tonight. I'*ll have finished* my homework by then.


***** We use /would/ with the perfect to refer to something that *did not happen*
      in the past but would have happened *if the conditions had been right*:
      + If you had asked me I *would have helped* you.
      + I *would helped* you, _but_ you _didn't_ ask me.
      + You _didn't_ ask me _or_ I *would have helped* you.


***** We use *other modals* with perfective aspect when we are *looking back*
      from a point in time when something might have happened, should have
      happened or would have happened.

****** The point of time might me in the future:
       - We'll meet again next week. We *might have finished* the work by then.

**** Continuous aspect
     Both tenses have a continuous form. These continuous tenses are formed
     with the verb /be/ and the /-ing/ form of the verb:

***** for something happening *before and after* a given time.
      - He's getting on the train. /[before and after the moment of speaking]/

**** Active and passive voice
     *Transitive verbs* have both *active* and *passive* forms:

     | active                          | passive                       |
     |---------------------------------+-------------------------------|
     | The hunter killed the lion      | The lion was killed by hunter |
     | Someone has cleaned the windows | The windows have been cleaned |

     The passive forms are made up of the verb /be/ with a *past participle*:

     |             | /be/            | past participle |                    |
     |-------------+-----------------+-----------------+--------------------|
     | English     | is              | spoken          | all over the world |
     | The windows | have been       | cleaned         |                    |
     | Lunch       | was being       | served          |                    |
     | The work    | will be         | finished        | soon               |
     | They        | might have been | invited         | to the party       |

     We sometimes use verb /get/ to form the passive:
     - Be careful with the glass. It might *get* broken.
     - Peter *got* hurt in a crush.

     If we want to show the person or thing doing the action we use *by*:
     - She was attacked by a dangerous dog.
     - The money was stolen by her husband.

     We can use the *indirect object* as the subject of a passive verb:

     | active                             | passive                              |
     |------------------------------------+--------------------------------------|

     | thousand euros                     | thousand euros                       |

     We can use *phrasal verbs* in the passive:

     | active                                | passive                                   |
     |---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
     | They *called off* the meeting         | The meeting *was called off*.             |
     | His grandmother *looked after* him    | He *was looked after* by his grandmother. |
     | They *will send* him *away* to school | He *will be sent away* to school.         |

     Some verbs very *frequently used in the passive* are followed by the
     *to-infinitive*:

     | be supposed to  | be expected to | be asked to |
     | be scheduled to | be allowed to  | be told to  |

     - John *has been asked to* make a speech at the meeting.
     - You *are supposed to* wear a uniform.

***** to express *purpose* (to answer "Why...?"):
      - He bought some flowers *to give* to his wife.

      We sometimes say /in order to/ or /in order not to/:
      - We set off early *in order to* avoid the traffic.
      - They spoke quietly *in order not to* wake the children.

      ...or we can say *so as to* or *so as not to*:

      | learn      | like       | love   | mean   | prefer | remember | want   |

      /agree, promise, refuse/
      - They decided to start business together.

      - She *reminded* _me_ *to* turn lights out.
      - He *encouraged* _his friends_ *to vote* for him.


***** after certain *adjectives*
      sometimes the /to/-infinitive gives a *reason* for the adjective:

      | disappointed | glad  | sad | happy | anxious | pleased |
      | surprised    | proud | unhappy |       |         |         |

      - We were *happy to come* to the end of our journey.

      | keen     | likely    | unlikely | ready |

      - Unfortunately I was *unable to work* for over a week.
      - I am really tired. I'm *ready to go* to bed.

      | hard      | right  | wrong    | kind       |

      - It's *easy to play* the piano, but it's very *difficult to play* well.

      - It was *difficult* _for us_ *to hear* what she was saying.

***** as a *noun*:
      - I love *swimming*.
      - *Swimming* is very good for your health.
      - You can get fit by *swimming* regularly.

***** *IF* clauses and hypotheses
      Some clauses with /if/ are like hypotheses so we use *past tense* forms

      with /if/:

****** for something that *has not happened* or *is not happening*:
       | He could get a new job if he really *tried*.   | = | He cannot get a job because he has not tried.       |

******* for something that we believe or know *will not happen*:
	| We would go by train if it *wasn't* so expensive. | = | We won't go by train because it is too expensive. |

******* to make suggestions about *what might happen*:
	- If he *came* tomorrow we could borrow his car.
	- If we *invited* John, Mary would bring Angela.


****** When we are talking about something which did *not* happen in the
       *past* we use the *past perfect* in the /if/ clause and a *modal*
       verb in the main clause:
       | If you had seen him you could have spoken to him | = | You did not see him so you could not speak to him.   |
       | You could have stayed with us if you had         | = | You couldn't stay with us because you didn't         |
       | come to London.                                  |   | come to London.                                      |

       | If I had got the job we would live in Paris.     | = | I did not get the job so we are not living in Paris. |

       If the *main clause* is about the *past* we use a *modal* with /have/:
       | If you had seen him you could *have* spoken to him. | = | You did not see him so you could not speak to him. |
       | You could *have* stayed with us if you had          | = | You couldn't stay with us because you didn't       |
       | come to London.                                     |   | come to London.                                    |
       | If you had invited me I might *have* come.          | = | You didn't invite me so I didn't come.             |

       If the *main clause* is about the *present* we use a present tense form
       or a *modal without have*:
       | If I had got the job we *would be living* in Paris | = | I did not get the job so we are not living in Paris now. |
       | now.                                               |   |                                                          |
       | If you had done your homework you would know the   | = | You did not do your homework so you do not know the      |
       | answer.                                            |   | answer.                                                  |

      - to talk about what people want to do or are willing to do

       - I'*ll give* her a call if I can find her number.

**** Double object verbs
     
***** Some verbsl have *two objects* -
      an indirect object and a direct object:

      | Subject | Verb    | Indirect object | Direct object    |
      |---------+---------+-----------------+------------------|
      | My wife | sent    | me              | an email         |
      | He      | brought | his mother      | some flowers     |
      | He      | cooked  | all his friends | a delicious meal | 

      These clauses have the structure:
      ~V + N(indirect object) + N(direct object)~

***** We can use a *prepositional phrase*
      with /to/ or /for/ with an indirect object:

      | Subject | Verb    | Direct Object    | Prepositional Phrase |
      |---------+---------+------------------+----------------------|
      | My wife | sent    | an email         | to me                |
      | He      | brought | some flowers     | for his mother       |
      | He      | cooked  | a delicious meal | for all his friends  |

      These clauses have the structure:
      ~V + N(direct object) + Prepositional phrase (indirect object)~

***** Common verbs with /for/ and an indirect object are:

      | book  | buy  | get  | cook | keep |
      | bring | make | pour | save | find |

      - He =booked= a table *for me* at the restaurant.
      - We =made= toys *for all the children*.


***** Common verbs with /to/ and indirect object are:

      | give | lend | offer | pass | post    |
      | read | sell | send  | show | promise |
      | tell |      |       |      |         | 

      - He =gave= his program *to the man* sitting next to him.
      - They =sent= Christmas cards *to all their customers*.


***** If the /indirect/ object is a /long phrase/ we normally use
      *to* or *for*:

      - He =showed= his ticket *to the policeman standing by the door*.
      - We =kept= something to eat and drink *for all the people who arrived late*.


***** If the /indirect object/ is a /pronoun/ we normally use
      the N + V + N + N pattern:

      - I =poured= /him/ =another drink=.
      - Their mother =read= /them/ =another story=.


***** Activities:
      - He bought some flowers for his grandmother.
      - If you need a jacket, I can lend one to you.

      - I've promised the ring to my daughter after I'm gone.

**** Phrasal verbs
     Some verbs are *two part* verbs (see Clauses, Sentences and
     Phrases). They consist of a *verb* and a *particle*:
      - grow + up
	>> The children are growing up.

      Often this gives the verb a *new meaning*:
      - take + after
	>> She takes after her mother.
	= She looks like her mother, or she behaves like her mother.
      - count + on
	>> I know I can count on you.
	= I know I can trust you, or I know I can believe you.

      Some *transitive* two part verbs (see Clauses, Sentences and
      Phrases) have *only one* pattern:

      *N(subject) + V + p + N(object)*

      | N(subject) | Verb      | Particle | N(object)  |
      |------------+-----------+----------+------------|
      | She        | takes     | after    | her mother |
      | I          | can count | on       | you        |
      | My father  | comes     | from     | Madrid     |

      Some transitive two part verbs are *phrasal verbs*. Phrasal
      verbs have *two different patterns*:

      - The usual pattern is: *N + V + N + p*
	| N(subject) | Verb            | N(object)   | Particle |
	|------------+-----------------+-------------+----------|
	| She        | gave            | the money   | back     |
	| He         | knocked         | the glass   | over     |
	| We         | will be leaving | our friends | behind   |

      - But sometimes these verbs have the pattern:
	*N + V + p + N*
	| N(subject) | Verb            | Particle | N(Object)   |
	|------------+-----------------+----------+-------------|
	| She        | gave            | back     | the money   |
	| He         | knocked         | over     | glass       |
	| We         | will be leaving | behind   | our friends |

      When the object is a *personal pronoun*, these verbs have the pattern:
      *N + V + N + p*:
      - +She gave back it+
	>> She gave it back
      - +He knocked over it+
	>> He knocked it over
      - +We will be leaving behind them+
	>>We will be leaving them behind

      Phrasal verbs are nearly always made up of a *transitive verb*
      and a *particle*. *Common verbs* with their frequent particles
      are:

      | bring: | about, along, back, forward, in, off, out, round, up             |
      | buy:   | out, up                                                          |
      | call:  | off, up                                                          |
      | carry: | off, out                                                         |

      | leave: | behind, out                                                      |
      | let:   | down, in, off, out                                               |

      | point: | out                                                              |
      | push:  | about, around, over                                              |
      | put:   | across, away, down, forward, off, on, out, through, together, up |
      | read:  | out                                                              |
      | set:   | apart, aside, back, down                                         |
      | shut:  | away, int, off, out                                              |
      | take:  | apart, away, back, down, in, on, up, over                        |
      | think: | over, through, up                                                |

**** Reflexive and ergative verbs

***** Reflexive verbs
      The reflexive pronouns (see pronouns) are:
      | singular: | myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself |
      |-----------+--------------------------------------------|
      | plural:   | ourselves, yourselves, themselves          | 

      We use a *reflexive pronoun* after a *transitive verb*

      - I am teaching *myself* to play the piano.
      - Be careful with that knife. *You* might cut *yourself*.

     One easy way to create a unique skill is to combine two
     seemingly unrelated skills into one skill.  Being the best
     computer scientist in the world is really hard.  Being the
     person who knows the most about dolphins is really hard.
     But being the person who best knows about the intersection
     of software and dolphins is accomplishable.

     But if you and I have a debate and we argue two sides, and

     Decorators are convenient for factoring out common prologue,
     epilogue, and/or exception-handling code in similar functions
     (much like context managers and the "with" statement), such
     as:
     - Acquiring and releasing locks (e.g. a "@with_lock(x)" decorator);
     - Entering a database transaction (and committing if successful, 
       or rolling back upon encountering an unhandled exception);
     - Asserting pre- or post-conditions (e.g. "@returns(int)");
     - Parsing arguments or enforcing authentication (especially in web 
       application servers like Pylons where there's a global request 
       and/or cookies object that might accompany formal parameters 
       to a function);
     - Instrumentation, timing or logging, e.g. tracing every time a

*** If you’ve already studied Python in any sort of depth,
    you probably already know that this is where its OOP support begins
    to become attractive:

    Structure
    With OOP,  can naturally associate processing logic with record data—classes
    provide both a program unit that combines logic and data in a single package and
    a hierarchy that allows code to be easily factored to avoid redundancy.

    Encapsulation
    With OOP,  can also wrap up details such as name processing and pay increases
    behind method functions—i.e.,  are free to change method implementations
    without breaking their users.

    Customization
    And with OOP,  have a natural growth path. Classes can be extended and cus-
    tomized by coding n subclasses, without changing or breaking already working
    code.

        Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of
	programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct
	a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining
	to human beings what we want a computer to do.

	The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an
	essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of
	style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names
	of variables carefully and explains what each variable means.
	He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because
	its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for
	human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal
	methods that reinforce each other.

*** Getting Things Done is a time-management method
    described in a book of the same title by productivity consultant
    David Allen. It is often referred to as GTD. The GTD method rests
    on the idea of moving planned tasks and projects out of the mind
    by recording them externally and then breaking them into
    actionable work items. This allows one to focus attention on
    taking action on tasks, instead of on recalling them.

*** Core features
    In Magit staging a hunk or even just part of a hunk is as trivial as
    staging all changes made to a file.
    That being said, many users
    have reported that using Magit was what finally taught them what Git
    is capable of and how to use it to its fullest.
    Magit wraps and in many cases improves upon at least the following Git
    porcelain commands:

    Here's commonly used patterns.

    Pattern         Matches                                                  
    .               Any single character except newline ("\n").              
    \.              One period                                               
    [0-9]+          One or more digits                                       
    [^0-9]+         Skip digits

    [_A-Za-z0-9]+   one or more {letter, digit, underscore}                  
    [-_A-Za-z0-9]+  one or more {letter, digit, hyphen, underscore}          
    [[:ascii:]]+    one or more ASCII chars. (codepoint 0 to 127, inclusive) 
    [[:nonascii:]]+ one or more none-ASCII characters (⁖ Unicode characters) 
    [\n\t ]+        one or more {newline character, tab, space}.             
    
    Pattern     Matches                             
    "\([^"]+\)" capture text between double quotes. 
*** Repetition
    Pattern Matches                                                             
      +       match previous pattern 1 or more times                              
      *       match previous pattern 0 or more times                              
      ?       match previous pattern 0 or 1 time                                  
      +?      match previous pattern 1 or more times, but with minimal match      
	      (aka non-greedy)                                                    

*** Boundary anchors
      Pattern Matches                              
      ^…      Beginning of {line, string, buffer}  
      …$      End of {line, string, buffer}

      \b      word boundary marker                 

    Unicode character can be used literally. But for non-printable ones such as
    “RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK”, you can represent them by a code. See: Emacs: Newline
    Representation ^M ^J ^L

    When using interactive commands, emacs won't understand \n or \t.
    
    - To enter a new line, press 【Ctrl+q Ctrl+j】
    - To enter a Tab character, press 【Ctrl+q Tab ↹】 

*** Case sensitivity

    When using [a-z], it is not case sensitive by default. Case sensitivity is
    controlled by the variable case-fold-search. Call toggle-case-fold-search to
    toggle it.
    
    Do not use [A-z], because that'll match some punctuation chars too. Use
    [A-Za-z].

*** How to Solve It:
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    A perennial bestseller by eminent mathematician G. Polya, How to
    Solve It will show anyone in any field how to think straight.

    In lucid and appealing prose, Polya reveals how the mathematical
    method of demonstrating a proof or finding an unknown can be of
    help in attacking any problem that can be "reasoned" out--from
    building a bridge to winning a game of anagrams. Generations of
    readers have relished Polya's deft--indeed,
    brilliant--instructions on stripping away irrelevancies and going
    straight to the heart of the problem.

    In this best-selling classic, George Pólya revealed how the
    mathematical method of demonstrating a proof or finding an unknown
    can be of help in attacking any problem that can be "reasoned"
    out--from building a bridge to winning a game of anagrams.
    Generations of readers have relished Pólya's deft instructions on
    stripping away irrelevancies and going straight to the heart of a
    problem. How to Solve It popularized heuristics, the art and
    science of discovery and invention. It has been in print
    continuously since 1945 and has been translated into twenty-three
    different languages.

    Pólya was one of the most influential mathematicians of the
    twentieth century. He made important contributions to a great
    variety of mathematical research: from complex analysis to
    mathematical physics, number theory, probability, geometry,
    astronomy, and combinatorics. He was also an extraordinary
    teacher--he taught until he was ninety--and maintained a strong
    interest in pedagogical matters throughout his long career. In
    addition to How to Solve It, he published a two-volume work on the
    topic of problem solving, Mathematics of Plausible Reasoning, also
    with Princeton.

    Pólya is one of the most frequently quoted mathematicians, and the
    following statements from How to Solve It make clear why: "My
    method to overcome a difficulty is to go around it." "Geometry is
    the science of correct reasoning on incorrect figures." "In order
    to solve this differential equation you look at it till a solution
    occurs to you."

      *Definition*
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      A binary search tree is a rooted binary tree, whose internal nodes each
      store a key (and optionally, an associated value) and each have two
      distinguished sub-trees, commonly denoted left and right. The tree
      additionally satisfies the binary search tree property, which states that
      the key in each node must be greater than all keys stored in the left
      sub-tree, and not greater than all keys in the right sub-tree.[1]:287
      (The leaves (final nodes) of the tree contain no key and have no
      structure to distinguish them from one another.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     In computer science, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.
     It was the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree,
     the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one;
     if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to
     restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n)
     time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes
     in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and deletions may require
     the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.

     The AVL tree is named after its two Soviet inventors, Georgy
     Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis, who published it in their 1962 paper
     "An algorithm for the organization of information".

** Testing                                                              :TDD:

*** Main Concepts

**** Write better code in less time
     Evan Dorn
     http://lrdesign.com
     evan@lrdesign.com
     @idahoev

***** Intelligence is a liability

***** Smart people
      Can make progress without process (This is *not* a good thing)

***** False premises to avoid TDD
      - Washing hands and organizing surgical tools wastes a lot of time. I
	could help more patients if I just dove in.
      - We know how skyscrapers work. Just give us some bricks and we'll get
	started.


***** Professionals
      - Design, plan and prepare /first/.
      - ...then do the work.
      - This produces better results /faster/.


***** Process is the difference between
      - Surgery and cutting people open
      - Engineering and tinkering
      - Software engineering and programming


***** Software process
      - Architecture
      - Conventions & standards
      - Version Control
      - Coordination (agile, etc.)
      - Test-driven development


***** Tests provide
      - Documentation of code
      - Catch future errors
      - Long-term time savings

      But tests are just a tool, not a process

***** Test-Driven Development
      is more than just writing tests

***** TDD defined
      - Decide what the code will do
      - Write a test that will pass if the code does that thing
      - Run the test, see it fail
      - Write the code
      - Run the test, see it pass


***** TDD provides
      - Design and plan before you code
      - Document your design
      - Proof that code implements design
      - _Encourages design of testable code_


***** Testable code
      Looks a lot like good code!
      - Modular
      - Decoupled design
      - Methods of limited scope
      - etc.


***** Result
      Better code in /less time/.

***** Caveat
      You will have to do this for a while before you will be faster.

***** Caveat #2
      Intelligence is an *asset*.
      /Be smart about how you test/

***** Use judgment
      - Some things are too hard to test
      - Some tests are too trivial to be useful
      - Overtesting /is/ possible
      - Exploratory coding w/o tests is OK!

**** Why and when you should write unit tests?

***** What is unit testing for?
      *Test Suit*
      
****** Understand what to build
	 + Collaborate with people in other roles to understand what's needed
	   - Business analyst
	   - Product owner
	   - Tester
	   - Integration designer
	   - Lead developer
       
****** Document the units
	 - /Executable specification/
	   - Tests document the behavior of the code
	   - How the unit is intended to be used
       
****** Design the units
	 - Decompose the problem into units that are independently testable
	   - loose coupling
	 - Design the ~interface~ separately from doing the ~implementation~
       
****** Regression protection
	 Regression - something worked before and doesn't any more
	 - A Unit test should fail & point out which unit failed and why


****** Limitations of unit testing
       It's not a 100% guarantee of bug-free development
       - Testing can't find all the errors
       - Unit testing won't fine integration errors


***** Your personal development process

****** Test last
       - Design code
       - Achieve some results
       - Design test(s) to prevent regression
       - Debug and rework

       *Risk:*
       - Discover test-ability problems and bugs late in the process
       - You'll rush or skip designing the tests


****** Test first
       - Design code
       - Design tests
       - Write code

       *Risk:* Rework


****** Test driven
       - Write a test
       - Write a little code
       - Gradually rebuild code and test together


***** Continuous integration
      http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html

**** Test types
***** Unit
***** Integration
***** Soak
***** Performance
***** Smoke

**** Python and Testing

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     show you a new way to test, a way that puts much of
     the burden of testing right where it should be—on the computer. Even
     better, your tests will help you to find problems early, and tell you
     just where they are, so that you can fix them easily. You'll love the
     easy, helpful methods of automated testing, and test-driven development.
     #+END_QUOTE

***** Testing for fun and profit

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Spending less time on debugging and being sure of your result makes
      programming more fun. Producing a higher quality of code in a shorter
      amount of time makes it more profitable. The test suite provides instant
      feedback, allowing you to run each chunk of your code now instead of
      waiting for the program as a whole to be in a state where you can execute
      it. This quick turnaround makes programming both more satisfying and more
      productive.
      #+END_QUOTE

***** Levels of testing

****** Unit testing

****** Integration testing

****** System testing

***** Acceptance testing

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      When a program is first specified, we decide what behavior is expected
      out of it. Tests that are written to confirm that the program actually
      does what was expected are called acceptance tests.
      #+END_QUOTE

***** Regression testing

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Tests that make sure that the working code doesn't become buggy are
      called regression tests. They can be written before or after a bug is
      found, and they provide you with the assurance that your program's
      complexity is not causing the bugs to multiply.

      *A quick primer on properties*

      Properties are a feature of Python where we can delegate attribute access to a
      function. Since we declared price as a property, accessing Stock.price will cause
      the method to be called instead of searching for the attribute. In our
      implementation, it allows us to create an interface so that other modules can

***** A dual crossover moving average 
***** Implementing the dual crossover moving average 
***** Identifying code smells
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      What are the problems you can find with this code? The following are some
      problems:
      - *Long method*: Long methods and classes are difficult to read and
	understand.
      - *Unclear naming*: For instance, what is variable cpl supposed to be?
      - *Complex conditionals*: The if conditions are quite complicated, and it
	is unclear what exactly they are checking for.
      - *Bad comments*: None of the comments are descriptive and, in addition,
	two comments both say BUY signal. Obviously, one of them is wrong.
      - *Magic constants*: In various places, the numbers 5, 10, –11, and so on
	are =hard coded=. Suppose we decide to change the long-term moving
	average to use a 20-day period, then where are the places we need to
	change? What is the possibility that we may miss one?
      - *Code duplication*: Both the conditionals seem almost the same, with a
	 very minor difference.

      All these problems are generally referred to as code smells. Code smells
      are simple patterns that can be easily spotted and refactored to make
      code better. Sometimes, code smells can be rectified by doing a few
      simple changes. Other times, it may lead up to a change of the design
      itself.
      #+END_QUOTE
***** Refactoring 
****** The Rename Variable and Rename Method refactorings
       *Tests as a safety net*
****** Commenting Styles
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       Generally speaking, comments are a code smell because they indicate that
       the code itself is not easy to read.
       #+END_QUOTE
****** Replace Magic Literals with Constants
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       Replacing hard-coded values with constants accomplishes two things: first,
       should we need to change the values, we can do it at a single place, and,
       second, the constants are more descriptive and help make the code more
       readable.
       #+END_QUOTE

       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session TDD
         from enum import Enum

         # We then create the enumeration class.


         class StockSignal(Enum):
             buy = 1
             neutral = 0
             sell = -1

         # Finally, we can replace the return value with the enumeration:

             # NEUTRAL signal
         print('\n')
         print('This is a value: %d' % StockSignal.neutral.value)

         # With this change, we can also remove the comments above the return
         # values, as the constants are descriptive enough.
       #+END_SRC

       #+RESULTS:
       : 
       : >>> ... >>> >>> ... ... ... ... >>> ... >>> ...
       : This is a value: 0
       : 0

****** The Extract Method refactoring
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       Another way to make comments redundant is to take the code and put it in
       a method with a descriptive name.
       #+END_QUOTE
****** Replace Calculation with Temporary Variable
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       The conditional is messy because we are doing many calculations and
       comparisons at the same time, which is hard to follow. We can clean this
       up by using temporary variables to store the calculation values and then
       using the variables in the conditionals.
       #+END_QUOTE
****** Extract Conditional to Method
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       In this refactoring, we take the comparison and move
       it into its own method with a descriptive name.
       #+END_QUOTE
****** The DRY principle
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       *DRY* stands for *Don't Repeat Yourself*. If you ever find yourself
       writing the same (or similar) code in multiple places, there is a good chance
       that a refactoring will allow you to put that logic in once place and call it
       from each place that it is needed.
       #+END_QUOTE
****** Single Responsibility Principle
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       From a design perspective, the most common reason that classes get cluttered
       is due to not following the Single *Responsibility Principle (SRP)*. What this
       principle states is that a class should have a single, clear, coherent
       purpose. A class that tries to do too many different things is an indicator
       of a poor design.
       #+END_QUOTE
****** Extract Class
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       The Extract Class refactoring is used to take some functionality and move it
       into a separate class.
       #+END_QUOTE
****** Move Method to Class 
***** The importance of tests
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      It is easy to overlook small things when moving code around, which
      could end up breaking the code. By running the tests often, we know
      immediately when we break something. This makes it *easy to fix the mistake*.
      #+END_QUOTE
***** Exercise
***** Wrapping up
***** Summary

      Test-driven development and refactoring go hand in hand and are invaluable
      tools in any developer's toolbox.

****** Intermezzo: Coding Style
       Making it easy for others to read your code
       is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps
       tremendously for that.
       + Suggestions:
	 - When possible, put comments on a line of their own;
	 - Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to
       use "CamelCase" for classes and "lower_case_with_underscores" for
       functions and methods.

***** Data Structures
****** Terse manual
******* list.append(x)
	 Add an item to the end of the list.
	 Equivalent to "a[len(a):] = [x]".
	 #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session lists
           a = [66.25, 333]
           a.append(333)

	 #+END_SRC

	 #+RESULTS:
	 : 
	 : >>> [66.25, 333, 333]

******* list.extend(L)
	Extend the list by appending all the items in the given list.
	Equivalent to "a[len(a):] = L".
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session lists
	b = [1, 1234.5]
	a.extend(b)
	print(a)
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: >>> [66.25, 333, 333, 1, 1234.5]

******* list.insert(i, x)
	Insert an item at a given position.  The first argument is the
	index of the element before which to insert, so "a.insert(0, x)"
	inserts at the front of the list, and "a.insert(len(a), x)" is
	equivalent to "a.append(x)".
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session lists

******* list.remove(x)
	Remove the first item from the list whose value is *x*.  It is an
	error if there is no such item.
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session lists
	a.remove(66.25)
	print(a)
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: [333, -1, 333, 1, 1234.5]

******* list.pop([i])
	Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it.
	If no index is specified, "a.pop()" removes and returns the last
	item in the list.
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session lists
	a.pop(4)
	a.pop()
	print(a)
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:

	: [333, -1, 333]

******* list.clear()
	Remove all items from the list.  Equivalent to "del a[:]".
******* list.index(x, [n])
	Return the index in the list of the [n] item whose value is *x*.
	It is an error if there is no such item.
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session lists
	a.index(333)
	a.index(333, 2)
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:

	Reverse the elements of the list in place.
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session lists
	a.reverse()
	print(a)
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	:

****** Dictionaries
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       Unlike
       sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are
       indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and
       numbers can always be keys.  Tuples can be used as keys if they
       contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any
       mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a
       key. You can't use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place
       using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like "append()"
       and "extend()".

***** Errors and Exceptions
****** Syntax Errors
       Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most
       common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python
****** Exceptions
       Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may
       cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected
       during execution are called exceptions

****** Handling Exceptions
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session exeptions

         try:
             f = open('myfile.txt')
             s = f.readline()
             i = int(s.strip())
         except OSError as err:
             print("OS error: {0}".format(err))
         except ValueError:
             print("Could not convert data to an integer.")
         except:
             print("Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0])
             raise

       : >>> ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... OS error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'myfile.txt'

       The "try" ... "except" statement has an optional *else clause*, which,
       when present, must follow all except clauses.  It is useful for code
       that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception.
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session exeptions
         for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
             try:

                 print('cannot open', arg)
             else:
                 print(arg, 'has', len(f.readlines()), 'lines')

****** Raising Exceptions
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       The "raise" statement allows the programmer to force a specified
       exception to occur. For example:
       #+END_QUOTE
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session exeptions
       raise NameError('HiThere')
       #+END_SRC

       #+RESULTS:

       :   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
       : NameError: HiThere
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       If you need to determine whether an exception was raised but don't
       intend to handle it, a simpler form of the "raise" statement allows
       you to re-raise the exception:
       #+END_QUOTE
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session exeptions
         try:
             raise NameError('HiThere')
         except NameError:
             print('An exception flew by!')
             raise

****** User-defined Exceptions
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception
       class (see *Classes* for more about Python classes).  Exceptions
       should typically be derived from the "Exception" class, either
       directly or indirectly.  For example:
       #+END_QUOTE
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session exeptions
         class MyError(Exception):
             def __init__(self, value):
                 self.value = value
             def __str__(self):
                 return repr(self.value)

         try:
             raise MyError(2*2)
         except MyError as e:
             print('My exception occurred, value:', e.value)

         raise MyError('oops!')
       #+END_SRC

       #+RESULTS:
       : 
       : ... ... ... ... >>> ... ... ... ... My exception occurred, value: 4
       : Traceback (most recent call last):
       :   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
       : __main__.MyError: 'oops!'

****** Defining Clean-up Actions
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	A ~finally~ clause is always executed before leaving the "try"
	statement, whether an exception has occurred or not. When an exception
	has occurred in the "try" clause and has not been handled by an
	"except" clause (or it has occurred in an "except" or "else" clause),
	it is re-raised after the "finally" clause has been executed.  The
	"finally" clause is also executed "on the way out" when any other
	clause of the "try" statement is left via a "break", "continue" or
	"return" statement.

#+end_example

	In real world applications, the "finally" clause is useful for
	releasing external resources (such as files or network connections),
	regardless of whether the use of the resource was successful.

****** Predefined Clean-up Actions
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       The "with" statement allows objects
       like files to be used in a way that ensures they are always cleaned up
       promptly and correctly.	
       #+END_QUOTE
       #+BEGIN_SRC python
         with open("myfile.txt") as f:
             for line in f:
                 print(line, end="!")
       #+END_SRC

       After the statement is executed, the file ~f~ is always closed, even
       if a problem was encountered while processing the lines.

	Having seen the mechanics behind the iterator protocol, it is easy to
	add iterator behavior to your classes.  Define an "__iter__()" method
	which returns an object with a "__next__()" method.  If the class
	defines "__next__()", then "__iter__()" can just return "self":
	
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session classes

              """Iterator for looping over a sequence backwards."""

****** Generators
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session classes
         def reverse(data):
             for index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1):
                 yield data[index]

       #+END_SRC

       ~Generator~s are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators.
       They are written like regular functions but use the "yield" statement
       whenever they want to return data.  Each time "next()" is called on
       it, the generator resumes where it left off (it remembers all the data
       values and which statement was last executed).  An example shows that
       generators can be trivially easy to create:

       : ... ... f

****** Generator Expressions
       Some simple generators can be coded succinctly as expressions using a
       syntax similar to list comprehensions but with parentheses instead of
       brackets.
       #+BEGIN_SRC python
         >>> sum(i*i for i in range(10))                 # sum of squares

         >>> yvec = [7, 5, 3]
         >>> sum(x*y for x,y in zip(xvec, yvec))         # dot product
         260

         >>> from math import pi, sin
         >>> sine_table = {x: sin(x*pi/180) for x in range(0, 91)}

         >>> unique_words = set(word  for line in page  for word in line.split())

****** Batteries Included ®

***** Brief Tour of the Standard Library -- Part II

****** Output Formatting
******* Provides a version of ~repr()~ customized for abbreviated   :reprlib:
	displays of large or deeply nested containers:
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
          import reprlib
          reprlib.repr(set('supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'))
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: >>> "set(['a', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', ...])"

******* When the result is longer than one line, the "pretty	     :pprint:
	printer" adds line breaks and indentation to more clearly reveal data
	structure:
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
          import pprint
          t = [[[['black', 'cyan'], 'white', ['green', 'red']], [['magenta',
              'yellow'], 'blue']]]

******* The "textwrap" module formats paragraphs of text to fit	   :textwrap:
	a given screen	 width:
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
          import textwrap
          doc = """The wrap() method is just like fill() except that it returns
          a list of strings instead of one big string with newlines to separate

	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:

	: ... ... >>>
	: The wrap() method is just like fill()
	: except that it returns a list of strings
	: instead of one big string with newlines
	: to separate the wrapped lines.

******* The "locale" module accesses a database of culture specific  :locale:
	data formats. The grouping attribute of locale's format
	function provides a direct way of formatting numbers with
	group separators:
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
          import locale
	  # en_US.utf8 is out from locale -a bash output
          locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US.utf8')

          conv = locale.localeconv()          # get a mapping of conventions
          x = 1234567.8
          locale.format("%d", x, grouping=True)

          locale.format_string("%s%.*f", (conv['currency_symbol'],
                               conv['frac_digits'], x), grouping=True)
	#+END_SRC

       : ERROR:root:Error occurred
       : CRITICAL:root:Critical error -- shutting down

****** Weak References						 :weakref:gc:
       Python does automatic memory management (reference counting for most
       objects and *garbage collection* to eliminate cycles).  The memory is
       freed shortly after the last reference to it has been eliminated.
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
         import weakref, gc
         class A:
             def __init__(self, value):
                 self.value = value
             def __repr__(self):
                 return str(self.value)

         a = A(10)                   # create a reference

****** Tools for Working with Lists
******* Array							      :array:
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
          from array import array
          a = array('H', [4000, 10, 700, 22222])
          print('\n')
          sum(a)

	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: >>>
	: 26932
	: 
	: array('H', [10, 700])
******* Deque							      :deque:
	The "collections" module provides a "deque()" object that is like a
	list with faster appends and pops from the left side but slower
	lookups in the middle. These objects are well suited for implementing
	queues and breadth first tree searches:

	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
          from collections import deque
          d = deque(["task1", "task2", "task3"])
          d.append("task4")
          print('\n')
          print("Handling", d.popleft())
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: >>> >>>

          def breadth_first_search(unsearched):
              node = unsearched.popleft()
              for m in gen_moves(node):
                  if is_goal(m):
                      return m
                  unsearched.append(m)

	#+END_SRC
******* Bisect							     :bisect:
	In addition to alternative list implementations, the library also
	offers other tools such as the "bisect" module with functions for
	manipulating sorted lists:

	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
          import bisect
          scores = [(100, 'perl'), (200, 'tcl'), (400, 'lua'), (500, 'python')]
          bisect.insort(scores, (300, 'ruby'))
	  print('\n')
          scores
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: >>> >>>
	: [(100, 'perl'), (200, 'tcl'), (300, 'ruby'), (400, 'lua'), (500, 'python')]
******* Heap							      :heapq:
	The "heapq" module provides functions for implementing heaps based on
	regular lists.  The lowest valued entry is always kept at position
	zero.  This is useful for applications which repeatedly access the
	smallest element but do not want to run a full list sort:

	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
          from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush
          data = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]
          heapify(data)                      # rearrange the list into heap order
          heappush(data, -5)                 # add a new entry
          print('\n')
          [heappop(data) for i in range(3)]  # fetch the three smallest entries
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: >>> >>> >>>
	: [-5, 0, 1]

****** Decimal Floating Point Arithmetic			    :Decimal:
       Several curious observations:

******* Difference in results
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
          from decimal import Decimal
          round(Decimal('0.70') * Decimal('1.05'), 2)
          round(.70 * 1.05, 2)
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: Decimal('0.74')
	: 0.73

******* Non-equality
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
          Decimal('1.00') % Decimal('.10')
          print('\n')
          1.00 % 0.10

          sum([Decimal('0.1')]*10) == Decimal('1.0')

          sum([0.1]*10) == 1.0
	#+END_SRC

******* Arbitrary precision
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session stdlib2
          getcontext().prec = 36
          Decimal(1) / Decimal(7)
	#+END_SRC

***** Floating Point Arithmetic:  Issues and Limitations
      Just remember, even though the printed result looks like the exact
      value of 1/10, the actual stored value is the nearest representable
      binary fraction.
      #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session floating
        import math
        format(math.pi, '.12g')
        format(math.pi, '.2f')

        .1 + .1 + .1 == .3              # Sad but true ;-(
	round(.1, 1) + round(.1, 1) + round(.1, 1) == round(.3, 1)
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:

      : '3.14'
      : '3.141592653589793'
      : False
      : False

****** Representation Error
       refers to the fact that some (most, actually)
       decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary (base 2)
       fractions. This is the chief reason why Python (or Perl, C, C++, Java,
       Fortran, and many others) often won't display the exact decimal number
       you expect.

******* Ease of debugging and testing

******* Composability

	Over time you'll form a personal library of utilities.  Often you'll
	assemble new programs by arranging existing functions in a new
	configuration and writing a few functions specialized for the current
	task.

****** Generators						      :yield:
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       Generators are a special class of functions that simplify the task of
       writing iterators.  Regular functions compute a value and return it,
       but generators return an iterator that returns a stream of values.
       #+END_QUOTE
       This is what generators provide; they can be thought of as resumable
       functions.
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session fp
         def gen_ints(n):
             for i in range(n):
                 yield i

         j = gen_ints(4)  # j is simple generator
	 print('\n')
         next(j)
         print(next(j))
       #+END_SRC

       #+RESULTS:
       : 
       : ... ... >>> >>>
       : 0
       : 1

       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       When you call a generator function, it doesn't return a single value;
       instead it returns a generator object that supports the iterator
       protocol.  On executing the "yield" expression, the generator outputs
       the value of "i", similar to a "return" statement.  The big difference
       between "yield" and a "return" statement is that on reaching a "yield"
       the generator's state of execution is suspended and local variables
       are preserved.  On the next call to the generator's "__next__()"
       method, the function will resume executing.

         def deco1(f):
             def new_f1():
                 print("Entering", f.__name__)

       Another approach:
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session deco
         def p_decorate(func):
             def func_wrapper(name):
                 return "<p>{0}</p>".format(func(name))

                 return "<strong>{0}</strong>".format(func(name))
             return func_wrapper

         def div_decorate(func):

         @div_decorate
         @p_decorate
         @strong_decorate
         def get_text(name):
             return "lorem ipsum, {0} dolor sit amet".format(name)

         print('\n')
         print(get_text("Ahab"))

       #+END_SRC

       #+RESULTS:
       : 
       : ... ... ... >>> ... ... ... ... >>> ... ... ... ... >>> ... ... ... ... ... >>>
       : <div><p><strong>lorem ipsum, Ahab dolor sit amet</strong></p></div>

***** Decorating Methods
      #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session deco
        def p_decorate(func):
            def func_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                return "<p>{0}</p>".format(func(*args, **kwargs))
            return func_wrapper

        class Person(object):
            def __init__(self):
                self.name = "John"
                self.family = "Doe"
            @p_decorate
            def get_fullname(self):
                return self.name+" "+self.family

        my_person = Person()
	print('\n')
        print(my_person.get_fullname())
	print(my_person.get_fullname.__name__)
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      : 
      : ... ... ... >>> ... ... ... ... ... ... ... >>> >>>
      : <p>John Doe</p>
      : func_wrapper

***** Passing arguments to decorators
      #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session deco
        def tags(tag_name):
            def tags_decorator(func):
                def func_wrapper(name):
                    return "<{0}>{1}</{0}>".format(tag_name, func(name))
                return func_wrapper
            return tags_decorator

        @tags("p")
        def get_text(name):
            """returns some text"""
            return "Hello "+name

        print('\n', get_text("John"))
        print(get_text.__name__) # get_text
        print(get_text.__doc__) # returns some text
        print(get_text.__module__) # __main__
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      : 
      : ... ... ... ... ... >>> ... ... ... ... >>> 
      :  <p>Hello John</p>
      : func_wrapper
      : None
      : __main__

      Obviously that all private methods are overwritten
      by decorator function. It is no matter for learning
      sample but huge significant detail during debugging.

***** functools.wraps()					    :functools:wraps:
      They are rescue in that case:
      #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session deco
        from functools import wraps

        def tags(tag_name):
            def tags_decorator(func):
                @wraps(func)            # <
                def func_wrapper(name):
                    return "<{0}>{1}</{0}>".format(tag_name, func(name))
                return func_wrapper
            return tags_decorator

        @tags("p")
        def get_text(name):
            """returns some text"""
            return "Hello "+name

        print('\n', get_text("John"))
        print(get_text.__name__) # get_text
        print(get_text.__doc__) # returns some text
        print(get_text.__module__) # __main__

      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      : 
      : >>> ... ... ... ... ... ... ... >>> ... ... ... ... >>> 
      :  <p>Hello John</p>
      : get_text
      : returns some text
      : __main__

      - Decorators are widely used in Python
      - It's possible to overuse decorators
	Be mindful
      - They can improve maintainability, increase
	clarity and reduce complexity

*** Mastering Python OOP                                                :OOP:
**** Introduction To Object Oriented Python
***** Introduction And About The Author
****** Course Objectives
       - Design reusable Object-Oriented Python classes
       - Apply powerful OOP concepts to handle complexity 
	 + Classes, instances
	 + Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
       - Handle errors (exceptions)
       - Serialize (store) objects for later use
       - Debug, test and benchmark your code
****** Purpose and Outcomes

	 + Java
	 + C++
	 + JavaScript
	 + etc.
       - Be able to contribute Python code on a professional level
       - Understand OOP terminology when discussed online or in interviews
       - Take an essential next step in your Python education
       - If already familiar with OOP, see how it is applied in a 
       /Pythonic/ way
	
***** What Is Object Oriented Programming And Why
****** What is an Object
       An /object/ is a unit of data (having one or more attributes), of
       a particular class or type, with associated functionality (methods)
****** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
       - Developed in the 1960's (Simula67, smalltalk)
       - A paradigm for code organization and design
       - The OOP paradigm:
	 - Organized data into /objects/ and functionality into /methods/
	 - Defines object specifications (data and methods) in classes
       - Promote collaboration, code extension and maintenance
       - The primary paradigm for software design worldwide
****** OOP: Why?
       - OOP organizes code so it is:
	 - Easier to use
	 - Easier to understand
	 - Easier to maintain and extend
	 - Easier to collaborate
       - Complexity must always be managed
       - OOP is a universal paradigm (many languages)
       - Learning OOP is a necessary next step into the larger world of 
       software engineering
****** OOP: three pillars					    :pillars:
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       - encapsulation
	 - data hiding or restricting access to data
	 - put data and operations in the same place
       - inheritance
       - polymorphism
	 - the provision of a single interface to entities of
	   different types
       #+END_QUOTE
       object composition is a way to combine simple objects
       or data types into more complex ones
***** Object-Oriented Python
      - Everything is an object, even numbers
      - Other languages employ /primitives/ (non-object data)
      - All entities in Python follow the same rules of objects
	- Every object (instance of a class) has a type (the class)
	- The object or class has attributes, some of which are methods

***** Modules Versus Classes
      - Python modules are files that contain Python code
      - Python modules can b executed or imported
      - Modules can contain class definitions
      - Sometimes a module consists of a single class;
	in this case a module may seem synonymous with a class
	 
**** Getting Started
***** Prerequisites And Toolkit
      1. Prerequisites
      2. Able to write and run Python programs
      3. Have debugged programs and diagnosed errors
      4. Can use /built-in/ data structures:
	 - numbers
	 - strings
	 - lists
	 - tuples
	 - dictionaries
	 - sets
	 - files
      5. Can use /for/ loops, /while/ loops /if/ statements
      6. Can write functions
      7. Python 2.x
	 - built-in on most Mac and Linux systems
	 - must be installed on Windows
	 - use ~python -V~ at Python prompt to see version
	 - Python 3 is very similar to Python 2
      8. Supplementary Module Installs
	 - *Yaml* for data serialization
	 - *pytest* for testing
***** Choosing An IDE Or Text Editor And Workflow
      An integrated development environment is a text editor
      geared toward software development
      - Syntax highlighting
      - Function indexing
      - Running programs
      - Debugging

**** Classes
***** Classes, Instances, Attributes And Methods
      - Class: a blueprint for an instance
      - Instance: a constructed /object/ of the class
      - Type: indicates the class the instance belongs to
      - Attribute: any object value: /object.*attribute*/
      - Method: a =callable attribute= defined in the class
***** Defining A Class
      - Review: /class/
	- Classes are =instance factories=
	- Classes define an =instance blueprint=
      - Construct an /instance/ or object of the class
	- Instances know to which class they belong (=type=)
	- Instances can access variables defined in the class
      #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session oop
        class MyClass(object):
            pass

        this_obj = MyClass()
        print('\n')
        print(this_obj)
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      : 
      : >>> >>> ... ... >>> >>>
      : <__main__.MyClass object at 0x7ff2119ce128>
****** Brief overview differences between old-style
       and new-style objects [[https://wiki.python.org/moin/NewClassVsClassicClass][there]]
***** Instance Methods
      When we call the instance method this instance is passed as the
      first argument automatically
      - Instance methods are variables defined in the class
      - They are accessed through the instance:
	*instance.method()*
      - When called through the instance the instance is 
	automatically passed as first argument to the method
      - Because of this automatic passing of the instance, 
	instance methods are known as /bound/ methods, i.e. 
	bound to the instance upon which it is called

      Six point to remember:

      - An /instance/ of a /class/ knows what class it's from
      - Vars defined in the class are available to the instance
      - A method on an instance passes /instance/ as the first 
	argument to the method (named /self/ in the method)
      - Instances have their own data, called /instance attributes/
      - Variables defined in the class are called /class attributes/
      - When we read an attribute, Python looks for it first in the 
	instance, and then the class
      #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session oop
        class Joe(object):
            def callme(self):
                print('calling "callme" method with instance:  ')

***** Instance Attributes

      An /object/ is a unit of data (having one or more attributes),
      of a particular /class/ or type, with associated functionality
      (methods).

      =STATE=
      - We have seen than an instance can access variables defined 
	in the class
      - An instance can also get and set values in /itself/
      - Because these values change according to what happens to 
	the object, we call these values =state=
      - Instance data takes the form of /instance attribute/ values, 
	set and accessed through *object.attribute* syntax

***** Encapsulation
      OOP three major facets (pillars)
      - encapsulation
	- refers to the safe storage of data (as attributes) 
	  in an instance
	- data should be accessed only through instance methods
	- data should be evaluated as correct (depending on the 
	  requirements set in class methods)
	- data should be safe from changes by external processes
      - inheritance
      - polymorphism

      *Breaking encapsulation*

      - Although normally set in a setter method, instance
	attribute values can be set anywhere
      - Encapsulation in Python is a voluntary restriction
      - Python does not implement data hiding, as does other 
	languages
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session oop
          class MyClass(object):
              def set_val(self, val):
                  self.value = val

      - _init_ is a keyword variable: it must be named init
      - It is a method automatically called when a new instance is
	constructed
      - If it is not present, it is not called
      - The *self* argument is the first appearance of the instance
      - __init__ offers the opportunity to initialize attributes
	in the instance at the time of construction

       Class attributes vs instance attributes

       - _Attributes_ / _variables_ in the class are accessible through the
	 instance
       - Instance attributes are also accessible by the instance
       - When we use the syntax /object.attribute/, we're asking Python
	 to look up the attribute:
	 - first in the instance
	 - Then in the class
       - Method calls through the instance follow this look-up.
       #+END_QUOTE

       6 points to understanding classes

       - An instance of a class knows what class it's from
       - Vars defined in the class are available to the instance
       - A method on an instance passes /instance/ as the first
	 argument to the method (named /self/ in method)
       - Instances have their own data, called /instance attributes/
       - Variables defined in the class are /class attributes/
       - When we read an attribute, Python looks for it first in
	 the instance, and then the class.

****** Some inheritance terms
       - An inheriting class
	 - Child class
	 - Derived class
	 - Subclass
       - An inherited class
	 - Parent class
	 - Base class
	 - Superclass
****** Inheritance itself
******* The second pillar of *OOP*
******* One class can inherit from another
******** The class/ attributes ar inherited
******** In particular, its methods ar inherited
******** This means that instances of an inheriting (child)
	 class can access attributes of the inherited (parent) class
******* This is simply another level of attribute lookup:
	- instance;
	- class;
	- inherited class.
***** Inheritance Examples

        class Animal(object):
            def __init__(self, name):

        f = Cat('Fluffy')

        r.fetch('paper')
        f.swatstring()
        r.eat('dog food')
        unittest.TestCase.assertRaises(AttributeError, r.swatstring())
        f.eat('cat food')

      #+RESULTS:

****** Inheritance hierarchy
       - Classes can be organized into an /inheritance hierarchy/
       - A child class can access the attribu;tes of all parent 
	 (grandparent, etc.) classes
       - Inheritance promotes code collaboration and reuse
       - "No code should appear twice"
***** Polymorphism
      *Many Shapes*
      - The third pillar of OOP
      - Two classes with same /interface/ (i.e., method name)
      - The methods are often different, but conceptually similar
      - Allows for expressiveness in desigh: we can say that this 
	group of related classes implement the same action
      - /Duck typing/ refers to reading an object's attributes to 
	decide whether it is of a proper type, rather than checking 
	the type itself
	
****** Example #1
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
         class Animal(object):
             def __init__(self, name):
                 self.name = name

             def eat(self, food):
                 print('{0} eats {1}'.format(self.name, food))

***** Inheriting The Constructor
      - *__init__* is like any other method; it can be inherited
      - if a class does not have an *__init__* constructor, Python 
	will check it parent class to see if it can find one
      - As soon as it finds one, Python calls it and stops looking
      - We can use the *super()* function to call methods in the 
	parent class
      - We may want to initialize in the parent as well as our 
	own class

****** Example #2
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
         import random

         class Animal(object):
             
             def __init__(self, name):
                 self.name = name


         class Dog(Animal):

             def __init__(self, name):
                 super(Dog, self).__init__(name)
                 self.breed = random.choice(['Shih Tzu', 'Beagle', 'Mutt'])
                 
             def fetch(self, thing):
                 print('{0} goes after the {1}'.format(self.name, thing))

         d = Dog('Pluto')
         print(d.name)
         print(d.breed)

       #+RESULTS:

***** Multiple Inheritance And The Lookup Tree
      - Any class can inherit from multiple classes
      - Python normally uses a /depth-first/ order when 
	searching inheriting classes
      - But when two classes inherit from the same class, 
	Python elieminates the first mention of that class from 
	the /mro/ (method resolution order)
      - The above applies to "new style" classes (inheriting from 
	/object/)

***** Abstract Classes
***** Method Overloading - Extending And Providing
***** Composition Versus Inheritance

**** Advanced Features
***** Implementing Core Syntax
      Our classes can respond to core syntax features:
      - Operators like +, -, *, /
      - Operators like =in=
      - Built-in functions like len() and str()
      - Looping
      - Subscripts and slices



      Core syntax features translate to ~magic~ method calls
      [[http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html][Full list]] of ~magic~ methods
****** Core syntax resolutions:
       | Strict implementation | Magic method            |
       |-----------------------+-------------------------|
       | 'abc' in var          | var.__contains__('abc') |
       | var == 'abc'          | var.__eq__('abc')       |
       | var[1]                | var.__getitem__(1)      |
       | var[1:3]              | var.__getslice__(1, 3)  |
       | len(var)              | var.__len__()           |
       | print(var)            | var.__repr__()          |
****** Sample
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :session core
         class SumList(object):

             def __init__(self, this_list):
                 self.mylist = this_list

             def __add__(self, other):

                 new_list = [x + y for x, y in zip(self.mylist, other.mylist)]
                 return SumList(new_list)

             def __repr__(self):
                 return str(self.mylist)
       #+END_SRC
       Now, when our example class is defined, lets try to evaluate it:
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :session core
         cc = SumList([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
         dd = SumList([100, 200, 300, 400, 500])

         ee = cc + dd
         print ee
       #+END_SRC


***** Subclassing Built-Ins
      
****** Classical usage
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :session core
         class MyClass(object):
             pass

         x = MyClass()
         x.this = 'Hello'
         x.that = 'anything'

         print(x.this, ' ', x.that)
       #+END_SRC
       
****** Inheriting from built-ins
       - Python lets our classes inherit from built-in classes;
       - An inheriting (child) class of a built-in shares all the same 
	 attributes (including methods) of the built-in;
       - We can take advantage of core built-in functionality, but 
	 customize selected operations;
       - Built-in behaviour is familiar to all Python developers - this 
	 can make use of our inheriting class easy to learn.

******* Sample #1
       	#+BEGIN_SRC python :session core
          class MyDict(dict):
              pass

          dd = MyDict()
          dd['a'] = 5
          dd['b'] = 6

          for key in dd.keys():
              print('{0}={1}'.format(key, dd[key]))
       	#+END_SRC

******* Sample #2
       	#+BEGIN_SRC python :session core
          class MyDict(dict):

              def __setitem__(self, key, val):
                  print("setting a key and value!")
                  dict.__setitem__(self, key, val)  # prevent recursion

          dd = MyDict()
          dd['a'] = 5
          dd['b'] = 6

          for key in dd.keys():
              print('{0}={1}'.format(key, dd[key]))
       	#+END_SRC

******* Sample #3
       	#+BEGIN_SRC python :session core
          class MyList(list):  # inherit from list

              def __getitem__(self, index):
                  if index == 0: raise IndexError
                  if index > 0: index = index - 1
                  return list.__getitem__(self, index)  # prevent recursion

              def __setitem__(self, index, value):
                  if index == 0: raise IndexError
                  if index > 0: index = index - 1
                  list.__setitem__(self. index, value)  # prevent recursion

          x = MyList(['a', 'b', 'c'])
          print(x)
          x.append('spam')
          print(x[0])
          print(x[4])
       	#+END_SRC

***** Attribute Encapsulation

****** Classical example:
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :session core
         class MyClass(object):

             def set_val(self, val):
                 self.value = val

             def get_val(self):
                 return self.value

         a = MyClass()
         b = MyClass()

         a.set_val(10)
         b.set_val(100)

         print(a.get_val())
         print(b.get_val())
       #+END_SRC

****** But
       - Instance attributes can be changed anywhere, to any value, 
	 breaking encapsulation;
       - Getter and Setter methods /encourage/ encapsulation, 
	 but are clunker;
       - Users are expected to _do the right thing_;
       - Trusting the user is /Pythonic/

****** @property
       - *@property* is a decorator that designates an instance attribute 
	 as encapsulate-able through methods;
       - Getting, setting and deleting methods can be defined, called 
	 automatically when a user accesses the attribute;
       - The names are linked to the attribute name - the methods, 
	 and setter and deleter methods must use it;
       - @property offers some control, but don't try to force the user 
	 into certain behaviors - it's un-Pythonic!

****** Sample
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
         class GetSet(object):

             def __init__(self, value):
                 self.attrval = value

             @property
             def var(self):
                 print("Getting the 'var' attribute")
                 return self.attrval

             @var.setter
             def var(self. value):
                 print("Setting the 'var' attribute")
                 self.attrval = value

             @var.deleter
             def var(self):
                 print("Deleting the 'var' attribute")
                 self.attrval = None

         me = GetSet(5)

         me.var = 1000
         print(me.var)
         del me.var
         print(me.var)
       #+END_SRC

****** @property: additional notes
       - @property should not encapsulate /expensive/ operations, because 
	 attribute setting looks /cheap/;
       - @property controls attributes that are expected, but can't 
	 control attributes that are unexpected;
       - __slots__ can define allowable attributes
	 - saves memory by defining attributes ahead of time
	 - should not be used to limit attributes - /un-Pythonic/!

       - /Public/ attributes or variables (intended to be used by the importer
         of this module or user of this class):
         *regular_lower_case*
       - /Private/ attributes or variables (internal use by the module or class):
         *_single_leading_underscore*
       - /Private/ attributes that shouldn't be subclassed:
         *__double_leading_underscore*
       - /Magic/ attributes:
         *__double_underscores__*

***** With Context
      
****** Several premises:
       - Some objects need to /clean-up/ when done
         - =File= object needs to /close()/
         - A network connection may need to close
         - A data-intensive operation may need to /del/ the data
       - =__with__= provides a block that /cleans up/ when exited
       - Can handle exceptions that occur within the block
       - Can also execute code when entered

****** Sample #1
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :session core
         with open('filename.txt') as fh:
             for line in fh:
                 line = line.rstrip()
                 print(line)

         # and an alternative version:

         fh = open('filename.txt')
         for line in fh:
             print(line)
         fh.close
       #+END_SRC

****** Sample #2
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
         class SampleClass(object):

             def __enter__(self):
                 print('we have entered "with"')
                 return self

             def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
                 print('we are leaving "with"')

             def say_hi(self):

         with SampleClass() as cc:
             cc.say_hi()
         print('after the "with" block')
       #+END_SRC

       #+RESULTS:
       : we have entered "with"

**** Object Serialization
     - /Serialization/ means /persistent/ storage, i.e., to disk
     - /Relational/ storage writes data to tables
       (e.g., relational database text files)
     - /Object-based/ storage stores objects as they are used in code
     - /Object-relational mappings/ can meditate between the two

             tup = pickle.load(fh)  # this is a tuple as an initial one
       #+END_SRC
****** Pickle and cPickle
       - Python-native object storage
       - Can store most Python objects on disk
       - Does not store classes, modules or functions
         but can refer to them
       - Not human readable
       - Uses the /pickle protocol/ which changes between
         versions of Python
       - cPickle is faster, C-compiled implementation
***** JSON
      - Java-script object notation
      - Extremely popular standard for storing and
        communicating structured data
      - Human readable
      - Often used for configuration files
      - Resembles Python, but is not always valid Python
***** YAML
      *YAML*: "Yaml Ain't Markup Language"
      - Serializes Python objects, like Pickle or JSON
      - Uses whitespace to separate elements
        key: value
        key2: value2
        key3:
        - listelement
        - listelement2
        - listelement3
      - *Pyyaml* install: =sudo pip install pyyaml=

*** Writing Idiomatic Python					     :idioma:
**** 1 Control Structures and Functions
***** 1.1 If Statements
****** 1.1.1 Avoid comparing directly to True , False , or None
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
         def raise_shields():
             return True

         def number_of_evil_robots_attacking():
             return 10

         def should_raise_shields():
             # "We only raise Shields when one or more giant robots attack,
             # so I can just return that value..."
             return number_of_evil_robots_attacking()
         # if should_raise_shields():  # idiomatic approach
         if should_raise_shields() == True:
             raise_shields()
             print ('Shields raised')
         else:
             print("Safe! No giant robots attacking")
       #+END_SRC

       #+RESULTS:
       : Safe! No giant robots attacking
****** 1.1.2 Avoid repeating variable name in compound if statement
      #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
        is_generic_name = False
        name = 'Tom'
        if name == 'Tom' or name == 'Dick' or name == 'Harry':
            is_generic_name = True

        # Idiomatic
        name = 'Tom'
        is_generic_name = name in ('Tom', 'Dick', 'Harry')
        print(is_generic_name)
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      : True
****** 1.1.3 Avoid placing conditional branch code on the same line as
      the colon
      #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
        name = 'Jeff'
        address = 'New York, NY'
        if name: print (name)
        print (address)
        # Idiomatic
        if name:
            print (name)
        print (address)
      #+END_SRC

      #+RESULTS:
      : Jeff
      : New York, NY
      : Jeff
      : New York, NY

***** 1.2 For loops       
****** 1.2.1 Use the enumerate function in loops instead of creating an “index” variable
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
         my_container = ['Larry', 'Moe', 'Curly']
         for index, element in enumerate(my_container):
             print ('{} {}'.format(index, element))
       #+END_SRC

       #+RESULTS:
       : 0 Larry
       : 1 Moe
       : 2 Curly

****** 1.2.2 Use the in keyword to iterate over an iterable
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
         my_list = ['Larry', 'Moe', 'Curly']
         for element in my_list:
             print (element)
       #+END_SRC

       #+RESULTS:
       : Larry
       : Moe
       : Curly

****** 1.2.3 Use else to execute code after a for loop concludes
       #+BEGIN_SRC python
         for user in get_all_users():
             print ('Checking {}'.format(user))
             for email_address in user.get_all_email_addresses():
                 if email_is_malformed(email_address):
                     print ('Has a malformed email address!')
                     break
             else:  # for loop successfully iterated all items
                 print ('All email addresses are valid!')
       #+END_SRC

       #+RESULTS:

***** 1.3 Functions
****** 1.3.1 Avoid using '' , [] , and {} as default parameters to functions
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
         # The default value [of a function] is evaluated only once.
         # This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object
         # such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. For
         # example, the following function accumulates the arguments
         # passed to it on subsequent calls.
         def f(a, L=[]):
             L.append(a)
             return L
         print (f(1))
         print (f(2))
         print (f(3))
         print('=============')

         # Idiomatic
         # 
         # 
         # If you don't want the default to be shared between subsequent
         # calls, you can write the function like this instead:
         def f(a, L=None):
             if L is None:
                 L = []
             L.append(a)
             return L
         print (f(1))
         print (f(2))
         print (f(3))
       #+END_SRC
****** 1.3.2 Use *args and **kwargs to accept arbitrary arguments
       #+BEGIN_SRC python
         def make_api_call(foo, bar, baz, *args, **kwargs):
             # Now I can accept any type and number of arguments
             # without worrying about breaking existing code.
             baz_coefficient = kwargs['the_baz']
             # I can even forward my args to a different function without
             # knowing their contents!
             return baz_coefficient in new_function(args)
       #+END_SRC
**** 2 Working with Data
***** 2.1 Lists
***** 2.1.1 Use a list comprehension to create a transformed version
      of an existing list
      #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
        # Harmful

        some_other_list = range(10)
        some_list = list()
        for element in some_other_list:
            if is_prime(element):
                some_list.append(element + 5)

        # Idiomatic               

        some_other_list = range(10)
        some_list = [element + 5 for
                     element in some_other_list if
                     is_prime(element)]
      #+END_SRC
***** 2.1.2 Use the * operator to represent the “rest” of a list
***** 2.2 Dictionaries
      2.2.1 Use the default parameter of dict.get to provide default
      values
      2.2.2 Use a dict comprehension to build a dict clearly and
      efficiently
***** 2.3 Strings
      2.3.1 Prefer the format function for formatting strings
      2.3.2 Use ''.join when creating a single string for list elements
      2.3.3 Chain string functions to make a simple series of transfor-
      mations more clear
***** 2.4 Classes
      2.4.1 Use underscores in function and variable names to help mark
      “private” data
      2.4.2 Define __str__ in a class to show a human-readable repre-
      sentation
***** 2.5 Sets
      2.5.1 Use sets to eliminate duplicate entries from Iterable con-
      tainers
      2.5.2 Use a set comprehension to generate sets concisely
      2.5.3 Understand and use the mathematical set operations
***** 2.6 Generators
      2.6.1 Use a generator to lazily load infinite sequences
      2.6.2 Prefer a generator expression to a list comprehension
      for simple iteration
***** 2.7. Context Managers
      2.7.1 Use a context manager to ensure resources are properly
      managed
***** 2.8. Tuples
      2.8.1 Use tuples to unpack data
      2.8.2 Use _ as a placeholder for data in a tuple that should be
      ignored
***** 2.9 Variables
      2.9.1 Avoid using a temporary variable when performing a swap
      of two values
**** 3 Organizing Your Code
***** 3.1 Modules and Packages
      3.1.1 Use modules for encapsulation where other languages would
      use Objects
***** 3.2 Formatting
      3.2.1 Use all capital letters when declaring global constant values
      3.2.2 Avoid placing multiple statements on a single line
      3.2.3 Format your code according to PEP8
***** 3.3. Executable Scripts
      3.3.1 Use sys.exit in your script to return proper error codes
      3.3.2 Use the if __name__ == '__main__' pattern to allow a
      file to be both imported and run directly
***** 3.4 Imports
      3.4.1 Prefer absolute imports to relative imports
      3.4.2 Do not use from foo import * to import the contents of a
      module.
      3.4.3 Arrange your import statements in a standard order
**** 4 General Advice
***** 4.1 Avoid Reinventing the Wheel
      4.1.1 Learn the Contents of the Python Standard Library
      4.1.2 Get to know PyPI (the Python Package Index)
***** 4.2 Modules of Note
      4.2.1 Learn the contents of the itertools module
      4.2.2 Use functions in the os.path module when working with
      directory paths

*** Programming design patterns

**** Gang of Fours
***** Creational Patterns

****** Abstract Factory
       Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent
       objects without specifying their concrete classes.

****** Builder
       Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so
       that the same construction process can create different representations.

****** Factory Method
       Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses
       decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
       instantiation to subclasses.

****** Prototype
       Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,
       and create new objects by copying this prototype.

****** Singleton
       Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of
       access to it.

***** Structural Patterns

****** Adapter
       Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
       Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of
       incompatible interfaces.

****** Bridge
       Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary
       independently.

****** Composite
       Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
       Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions
       of objects uniformly.

****** Decorator
       Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators
       provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

****** Facade
       Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade
       defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

****** Flyweight
       Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

****** Proxy
       Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

***** Behavioral Patterns

****** Chain of Responsibility
       Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than
       one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects
       and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

****** Command
       Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients
       with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

****** Interpreter
       Given a language, define a represention for its grammar along with an
       interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

****** Iterator
       Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially
       without exposing its underlying representation.

****** Mediator
       Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
       Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other
       explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

****** Memento
       Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object’s
       internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

****** Observer
       Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object
       changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

****** State
       Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The
       object will appear to change its class.

****** Strategy
       Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
       Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

****** Template Method
       Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to
       subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an
       algorithm without changing the algorithm’s structure.

****** Visitor
       Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
       Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the
       elements on which it operates.

***** Preface
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      A design pattern in architecture and computer science is a formal way of 
      documenting a solution to a design problem in a particular field of expertise. The 
      idea was introduced by the architect Christopher Alexander in the field of 
      architecture and has been adapted for various other disciplines, including computer 
      science. An organized collection of design patterns that relate to a particular field
      is called a pattern language. 
      #+END_QUOTE

***** The Model-View-Controller Pattern
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      “Model–View–Controller (MVC) is a software 
      architecture, currently considered an architectural 
      pattern used in software engineering. The pattern 
      isolates “domain logic” (the application logic for the 
      user) from input and presentation (GUI), permitting 
      independent development, testing and maintenance of 
      each.”

**** Design patterns from Lynda

***** What is a design pattern
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Well-known solutions to recurring problems
      #+END_QUOTE
      Widely accepted solutions by the software
      development community.
      Why use design patterns?
****** Motivations
******* No need to reinvent the wheel and waste your
	time
******* Systematic reuse of design ideas of best
	practices yields lower cost and higher quality
***** Types of design patterns
****** Creational Patterns
******* Definition
	Used to create objects in a systematic way
******* Benefits
	Flexibility
******* Example:
	Different subtypes of objects from the same
	class at runtime
****** Structural Patterns
******* Definition
	Establishes useful relationships between software
	components in certain configurations.
	To accomplish a goal: both functional and
	nonfunctional
	Different goals yield  different structures
****** Behavioral Patterns
******* Definition
	Best practices of objects interaction
******* Focus
	Define the protocols
***** Understanding object-oriented programming
      Object-oriented mechanism used /interfaces/ for
      - Structural inheritance;
      - Creational polymorphism;
      - Behavioral methods and their signatures
***** Working with inheritance and polymorphism
****** Inheritance
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       Establishes a relationship between two classes
       as *Parent* and *Child*
       #+END_QUOTE
****** Child Class
******* =Keeps= the attributes and methods
	of its parent
******* =Adds= new attributes or methods of
	its own
******* =Overrides= the existing methods of
	its parent
****** Polimorphism
******* Relies on inheritance
******* Allows child classes to be instantiated
	and treated as the same type as its parent
******* Enables a parent class to be manifest into
	any of its child classes
***** Understanding Pattern context
****** Participants
       - Classes involved to form a design pattern
       - Roles
****** Quality attributes
******* Nonfunctional requirements
	Usability, modifiability, reliability,
	perfomance, etc.
******* Effect on the entire software
	Architectural solutions
****** Forces
       Various factors or trade-offs to consider.
       Manifested in quality attributes.
       In most cases would intail unintended
       consequences.

***** Singleton

****** Definition
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software
       design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to
       one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed
       to coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes
       generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only
       one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a
       certain number of objects.

****** Problem
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern.
       Unlike the abstract factory pattern and the factory method pattern
       whose intention is to enable polymorphism, the intention of the
       builder pattern is to find a solution to the telescoping constructor
       anti-pattern. The telescoping constructor anti-pattern
       occurs when the increase of object constructor parameter combination
       leads to an exponential list of constructors.
       Instead of using numerous constructors, the builder pattern uses another
       object, a /builder/, that receives each initialization parameter step by
       step and then returns the resulting constructed object at once.
       #+END_QUOTE

       The main premise for design is an excessive number of constructors.

       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       =Builder= often builds a =Composite=. Often, designs start out using =Factory
       Method= (less complicated, more customizable, subclasses proliferate) and
       evolve toward =Abstract Factory=, =Prototype=, or =Builder= (more flexible,
       more complex) as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed.
       Sometimes creational patterns are complementary: =Builder= can use one of
       the other patterns to implement which components are built.

** Neural Networks for Machine Learning
*** Why do we need machine learning?
    It is very hard to write programs that solve problems like
    recognizing a three-dimensional object from a novel viewpoint in
    new lighting conditions in a cluttered scene.

    - We don't know what program to write because we don't know
      how its done in our brain;
    - Even if we had a good idea about how to do it, the
      program might be horrendously complicated.


    It is hard to write a program to compute the probability that a
    credit card transaction is fraudulent.

    - There may not be any rules that are both simple and reliable
      We need to combine a very large number of weak rules.
    - Fraud is a moving target. The program needs to /keep changing/


    Instead of writing a program by hand for each specific task,
    we collect lots of examples that specify the correct output
    for a given input.
    A machine learning algorithm then takes these examples
    and produces a program that does the job.

    - The program produced by the /learning algorithm/ may look
      very different from a typical hand-written program. It may
      contain millions of numbers.
    - If we do it right, the program works for new cases as well
      as the ones we trained it on.
    - If the data changes the program can change too by training
      on the new data.

    Massive amounts of computations are now cheaper than paying
    someone to write a task-specific program.

    Some examples of tasks best solved by learning

    Recognizing patterns:
    - Objects in real scenes
    - Facial identities or facial expressions
    - Spoken words


    Recognizing anomalies
    - Unusual sequences of credit card transactions
    - Unusual patterns of sensor readings in a nuclear power plant


    Prediction
    - Future stock prices or currency exchange rates
    - Which movies will a person like?


    A standard example of machine learning is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database][MNIST database]].

**** Installing Git
**** Getting Started
**** Git Concepts and Architecture
***** Exploring the three-trees architecture
	- Two-trees architecture close-up:
       	  + repository
       	  + working copy
	- Three-trees
       	  + staging index
	    /as a middle-ware/ between
***** The Git work-flow
	- change working copy
	- add these changes to staging index
	- commit they into repository
***** Using hash values (SHA-1)
	- Git generates a checksum for each change set
       	  - checksum algorithms convert data into a simple number
       	  - same data always equals same checksum
	- Data integrity is fundamental
       	  - changing data would change checksum
	- Git uses SHA-1 hash algorithm to create checksums
       	  - 40-character hexadecimal string (0-9, a-f)
***** Working with the HEAD pointer
      *HEAD*
      - pointer to *tip* of current branch in repository
      - last state of repository, what was last checked out
      - points to parent of next commit
	/where writing commits takes place/
**** Making Changes to Files
***** Adding files
***** Editing files
***** Viewing changes with diff
      git diff
***** Viewing only staged changes
      git diff --staged
***** Deleting files
      git rm
***** Moving and renaming files
      git mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
**** Undoing Changes
***** Undoing working directory changes
     ~git checkout -- index.html~
***** Unstaging files
     ~git reset HEAD resources.html~
***** Amending commits
     ~git commit --amend -m 'The last commit edit by join the new one'~
     /the same command to change commit message only/
***** Retrieving old versions
     ~git checkout <commit_id> -- <filename>~
***** Reverting a commit
     /mirror changes and invert it/
     ~git revert <commit_id>~
***** Using reset to undo commits
      ‘x’     (‘magit-reset’)

      Reset the head and index to some commit read from the user =and=
      defaulting to the *commit at point*.  The working tree is kept as-is.
      With a prefix argument also reset the working tree.

***** Demonstrating a soft reset
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Just rewind back in time
     #+END_QUOTE
     ~git reset --soft <commit_id>~
     - changes are allocated into the staging index
     - it's possible to:
       ~git reset --soft <recent_id>~
       ~git reset --soft HEAD^~
     - Like a *Time Machine*
     - Moves HEAD pointer among commits
     - Safest solution
***** Demonstrating a mixed reset
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Same as the previous one except that changes move into
     working tree (not staging index)
     #+END_QUOTE
     - Hence it handy to edit it up one more time
***** Demonstrating a hard reset
     - Move project state backward only
     - Leaves no traces of unnecessary commits
     - Really dangerous option *be aware*
***** Removing un-tracked files
     ~git clean~
     thrown away all unstaged files at once
**** Ignoring Files
***** Using .gitignore files
***** Understanding what to ignore
***** Ignoring files globally
***** Ignoring tracked files
     - add to .gitignore
     - tell git to stop tracking it
       ~git rm --cached <filename>~
       /removes the <file> out from staging index/
***** Tracking empty directories
**** Branching
***** Branching overview
***** Viewing and creating branches
***** Switching branches
***** Creating and switching branches
***** Switching branches with uncommitted changes
***** Comparing branches
     ~git diff <branch_1>..<branch_2>~
     ~git diff --color-words <branch_1>..<branch_2>^~
     ~git branch --merged~
***** Renaming branches
     ~git branch -m <old_b_name> <new_b_name>~
***** Deleting branches
     ~git branch -d <b_name>~
***** Configuring the command prompt to show the branch
**** Merging Branches
***** Merging code
***** Using fast-forward merge vs. true merge
***** Merging conflicts
***** Resolving merge conflicts
****** Abort
       ~git merge --abort~
****** Resolve the conflict manually
       It is necessary to test how to resolve it
******* Switch on custom branch
******* Make changes
	{this changes from the custom branch}
******* Commit changes
******* Return on master branch
******* Change the same hunk of code
******* Commit this changes
******* Merge branches
****** Use a merge tool
       ~git mergetool <Enter>~
***** Exploring strategies to reduce merge conflicts
****** keep lines short
****** keep commits small and focused
****** beware stray edits to whitespace
       - spaces;
       - tab;
       - line returns
****** merge often
****** track changes to master

**** Stashing Changes
     Special fourth area in git repository

***** Save changes
      ~git stash save "message~

***** View stashed changes
      ~git stash list~
      Changes in stash available to review from all branches
      ~git stash show [-p(atch)] stash@{0}~

***** Retrieve changes out from stash
      ~git stash pop~ removes stashed changes out from stash
      ~git stash apply~ leaves a copy in the stash

***** Deleting stashed changes
      ~git stash drop stash@{0}~
      ~git stash clear~ delete all existing stashed changes

**** Remotes
     The remote branch *master* mirrored by the local
     *origin/master*
     and it's possible to sync with your custom-made
     branch with the same name *master*

     ~git remote -v~
     ~git remote add~
     ~git remote add <shortname> <url>~
     etc.

     ~git branch -r(emotes)~
     ~git branch -a(ll)~
    
**** Tools and Next Steps
     ~git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'~

** Fork useful projects				:forks:
*** Manual how to fork
**** Forking itself
     Just by pushing the button on useful project
     page. It's enough to get its fork in your
     repo.
**** Sync your fork
     Sometimes in fork's ancestor occure changes.
     Exactly to pull it on your local version of
     repo do [[https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/][this]] or something like this:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git remote -v # check up does upstream configured ever
     # add it
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/mikeckennedy/talk-python-transcripts.git
     git remote -v
     git fetch upstream
     git checkout master
     git merge upstream/master     
     #+END_SRC
