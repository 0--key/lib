   This first one is shamelessly stolen from a presentation I saw at
   Microsoft a few years ago:

   1 Complex solutions to simple problems.
   2 Complex solutions to complex problems.
   3 Simple solutions to complex problems.
   4 Complex problems disappear

   Or, on another axis:

   1 You suck.
   2 You seek the advice of your teammates.
   3 Your teammates seek advice from you.
   4 People on other teams come to you for advice.

   (Never forget that despite 3 and 4, item 1 is still true and item 2 is
   still a good idea.)
   Or, on another axis:

   1 Your can write code.
   2 You can understand your code.
   3 You can fix your code.
   4 You can understand other peoples' code.
   5 You can fix other peoples' code.
   6 You can understand and fix your own code even when you wrote it so
   long ago that it might as well have been written by someone else.

   [Edited to add one more section...] 
   The following is all from a Wikipedia page about Four stages of
   competence. It is actually not about programming specifically, but it
   is a way to look at one's competence in any endeavor. I've found it
   interesting to look at all sorts of skills in these terms:

   1 Unconscious incompetence - The individual does not understand or
   know how to do something and does not necessarily recognize the
   deficit. They may deny the usefulness of the skill. The
   individual must recognize their own incompetence, and the value
   of the new skill, before moving on to the next stage. The length
   of time an individual spends in this stage depends on the
   strength of the stimulus to learn.
   2 Conscious incompetence - Though the individual does not
   understand or know how to do something, he or she does recognize
   the deficit, as well as the value of a new skill in addressing
   the deficit. The making of mistakes can be integral to the
   learning process at this stage.
   3 Conscious competence - The individual understands or knows how
   to do something. However, demonstrating the skill or knowledge
   requires concentration. It may be broken down into steps, and
   there is heavy conscious involvement in executing the new skill.
   4 Unconscious competence - The individual has had so much practice
   with a skill that it has become "second nature" and can be
   performed easily. As a result, the skill can be performed while
   executing another task. The individual may be able to teach it
   to others, depending upon how and when it was learned.

  shirk
  
** увиливать

   verb
   1. уклоняться (dodge, skew, avoid, shrink, evade, shirk)
   2. увиливать (shirk, prevaricate, equivocate, dodge, evade, wriggle out of)
   3. увиливать от работы (shirk, soldier)
   4. саботировать (sabotage, ratten, shirk)

   DEFINITION

   verb
   1. avoid or neglect (a duty or responsibility).
      "their sole motive is to shirk responsibility and rip off the
      company"

   noun
   1. a person who shirks.
      "His status as a shirk would normally render him somewhat of a
      pariah."


   To shirk your responsibilities is to avoid dealing with them — like
   when you watch four consecutive hours of infomercials instead of
   facing your homework.

   A verb is an action word, so it's ironic that the verb shirk
   suggests inaction in the avoidance of work. To shirk carries with it
   a negative connotation of laziness. When Eleanor Roosevelt was asked
   how she conquered her shyness to become a powerful public figure,
   she responded, "I faced each problem as it came along. . . . I never
   tried to shirk. I tried never to evade an issue. When I found I had
   something to do — I just did it." Ah, Eleanor, why can't we all be a
   bit more like you?

  consecutive
  
** последовательный

   adjective
   1. последовательный (consistent, serial, consecutive, successive, sequential, coherent)
   2. следственный (consecutive, inquisitional)

   DEFINITION

   adjective
   1. following continuously.
      "five consecutive months of serious decline"


   If things are consecutive, they happen one after the other with no
   break. If there are five consecutive snowstorms on five consecutive
   days, you'll have to shovel your way out on day six.

   Consecutive comes from the Latin consecutus, meaning "following
   closely" with no gap. Just like those snowstorms — one storm
   happened each day, back to back, for five days in a row. Consecutive
   numbers also follow each other, or advance in the right order. For
   example, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are consecutive numbers. You should
   number the pages on a term paper to keep them consecutive so the
   teacher doesn't get confused.

   To shirk your responsibilities is to avoid dealing with them — like
   when you watch four consecutive hours of infomercials instead of
   facing your homework.

* pallid							   :Demo:adj:
  [2016-06-26 Sun 17:47]

  мертвенно-бледный

  adjective
  1. бледный (pale, light, pallid, faint, wan, white)
  2. мертвенно-бледный (ashen, ghastly, pallid, livid, lurid, lunary)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. (of a person's face) pale, typically because of poor health.
     "Her mother was propped up against a pillow, her pallid face
     hardly standing out against the white background."


  Santa looks a little pallid, meaning that he has a pale complexion,
  from spending too much time at the North Pole. A few days in Hawaii
  might do wonders to add color to his pale, bearded face.

  Pallid means pale, or lacking color. It's often used together with
  complexion to describe someone who has a pale face, either due to a
  lack of sunshine or some kind of emotional distress. A reclusive
  author could be pallid from spending too much time indoors. His
  books can also be called pallid if they're lacking in color and
  excitement.

  'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow
  up the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt
  a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the
  half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in
  spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the
  touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic
  influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to
  appreciate.

* splendid							   :Demo:adj:
  [2016-06-26 Sun 17:54]

  великолепный

  adjective
  1. великолепный (great, sumptuous, gorgeous, magnificent, excellent, splendid)
  2. роскошный (luxurious, sumptuous, splendid, deluxe, palatial, rich)
  3. замечательный (remarkable, wonderful, great, admirable, marvelous, splendid)
  4. превосходный (excellent, superb, superior, superlative, fine, splendid)
  5. блестящий (brilliant, shiny, shining, bright, glossy, splendid)
  6. отличный (great, excellent, cool, splendid, classy, super)
  7. первоклассный (classy, superfine, topnotch, crack, exclusive, splendid)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. magnificent; very impressive.
     "a splendid view of Windsor Castle"


  Looking truly magnificent today? Then someone (probably British)
  might stop you to say "Wow! You look splendid, darling!" Thanks the
  person, because splendid means glorious, fabulous, wonderful, and/or
  splendiferous.

  Use the adjective splendid to describe something of the highest
  quality. If you're so lucky as to have someone buy you, say, a Harry
  Winston diamond, splendid! But splendid doesn't apply only to
  expensive items such as jewelry, clothing, or art. You can also have
  a splendid idea, morning walk, or encounter with an old friend. For
  some, using Splenda in their coffee instead of sugar is, for them,
  well, splendid!

  'Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South
  Kensington! Here, apparently, was the Palaeontological Section, and
  a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the
  inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and
  had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine
  hundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if
  with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and
  there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare
  fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the
  cases had in some instances been bodily removed—by the Morlocks as I
  judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our
  footsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping
  glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very
  quietly took my hand and stood beside me.

* stave							     :Demo:noun:verb:
  [2016-06-26 Sun 17:57]

  палка

  noun
  1. палка (stick, cane, staff, stave, bevel, discipline)
  2. шест (pole, perch, stave)
  3. бочарная клепка (lag, stave)
  4. перекладина (crossbar, beam, horizontal bar, rail, slat, stave)
  5. строфа (stanza, verse, strophe, stave)

  verb
  1. снабжать бочарными клепками (stave)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. a vertical wooden post or plank in a building or other structure.
     "It's like a workshop in Hades - you feel the heat from barrels
     set over open fires in the floor and hear the piercing din of
     hammers on steel as hoops are pounded onto staves ."
  2. a verse or stanza of a poem.

  verb
  1. break something by forcing it inward or piercing it roughly.
     "the door was staved in"
  2. avert or delay something bad or dangerous.
     "a reassuring presence can stave off a panic attack"


  A stave is the crosspiece between the legs of a chair or a wooden
  slat forming the side of a barrel. In music, it's the five lines you
  write notes on.

  Stave comes from the word staff, as in a walking stick. You're most
  likely to encounter the word stave if you're learning woodworking.
  If someone "staves in" a door, they've broken a hole in it. You also
  might hear the idiom "stave off," which means to hold off for a
  short time.

* stall							     :Demo:noun:verb:
  [2016-06-26 Sun 19:05]

  стойло

  noun
  1. стойло (stall, stable, box, bay, crib)
  2. киоск (kiosk, booth, stall, stand, newsstand, loge)
  3. ларек (stall, stand, loge)
  4. кабинка (cabin, stall)
  5. прилавок (counter, stall, bar)
  6. палатка (tent, booth, stall, bivvy, pavilion, tabernacle)
  7. конюшня (stable, barn, stabling, stud, stall)
  8. потеря скорости (stall)

  12. кресло в партере (stall)
  13. место стоянки автомашин (stall)
  14. забой (face, slaughtering, breast, side, stall)
  15. штабель (pile, stockpile, clamp, stall)
  16. увертка (subterfuge, evasion, dodge, quip, quibble, stall)
  17. стойло для обжига руды (stall)

  19. сиденье в алтаре или на хорах (stall)

  verb
  1. глохнуть (stall, go deaf, grow deaf)
  2. ставить в стойло (stall)
  3. делать стойло в конюшне (stall)

  11. быть занесенным снегом (stall)
  12. заглушать (choke, drown, muffle, silence, damp, stall)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. a stand, booth, or compartment for the sale of goods in a market or large covered area.
     "fruit and vegetable stalls"
  2. an individual compartment for an animal in a stable or barn, enclosed on three sides.
     "This configuration recalls the form of traditional livestock
     barns with a center walkway and animal stalls to each side."
  3. a fixed seat in the choir or chancel of a church, more or less enclosed at the back and sides and often canopied, typically reserved for a particular member of the clergy.
     "There were so many choir wannabes that they filled the choir
     platform, the stalls and the circle seats - and outnumbered the
     audience confined to the upper galleries."
  4. the seats on the ground floor in a theater.
     "The action is seen as it would be from a good seat in the
     theatre stalls ."
  5. an instance of an engine, vehicle, aircraft, or boat stalling.
     "speed must be maintained to avoid a stall and loss of control"

  verb
  1. (of a motor vehicle or its engine) stop running, typically because of an overload on the engine.
     "her car stalled at the crossroads"
  2. stop or cause to stop making progress.
     "his career had stalled, hers taken off"
  3. put or keep (an animal) in a stall, especially in order to fatten it.
     "One more row was behind these stalls on both sides, allowing a
     maximum of eighty horses to be stalled in the large place."


  Stall means to stop or delay. If your car stalls, it comes to a
  stop. When you want a horse to stop, you put him in a stall, or
  small enclosure inside a barn.

  The word stall implies stopping something that will start again — a
  horse will leave the stall eventually and start moving, a stalled
  car can be restarted. Remember that when you're thinking about stall
  in the sense of postpone or delay. You can stall your professor from
  giving an exam by talking about last night’s big game. Your little
  sister can stall going to bed by asking for one more story. If you
  want to delay an approaching army, you might steal their boots —
  they'll still come but the "stall tactic" will buy you time.

  1) "BTW, there's no toilet paper in that stall...." Not the same kind
  of issue in the ladies that it is in the gents. Most of the traffic
  in the men's room is headed to a urinal with no need of TP. In the
  women's I've both encountered stalls out of TP more often and had
  people mention it to other women headed for the deficient stall.

* virtue                                                          :Demo:noun:
  [2016-06-26 Sun 20:55]

  добродетель

  noun
  1. добродетель (virtue, goodness, honor, honour)
  2. достоинство (dignity, virtue, merit, denomination, quality, meritoriousness)
  3. сила (force, power, strength, intensity, might, virtue)
  4. целомудрие (chastity, virtue, pudicity)
  5. хорошее качество (goodness, virtue)
  6. действие (act, action, effect, force, influence, virtue)
  7. свойство (property, characteristic, feature, attribute, affinity, virtue)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. behavior showing high moral standards.
     "paragons of virtue"
  2. (in traditional Christian angelology) the seventh highest order of the ninefold celestial hierarchy.
     "It is said that 2 virtues midwived for Eve as she gave birth to
     Cain."


  Virtue is the quality of being morally good. If you're writing a
  screenplay and you want it to be a real tearjerker, make sure your
  hero is full of virtue.

  The word virtue comes from the Latin root vir, for man. At first
  virtue meant manliness or valor, but over time it settled into the
  sense of moral excellence. Virtue can also mean excellence in
  general. One of your virtues might be your generous willingness to
  help out your friends. The phrase by virtue of means "as a result
  of" or "by authority of." You will achieve success by virtue of hard
  work (or by virtue of inside connections).

  Your decisions your life : A great poet once said, "Wisdom is
  knowing what to do and virtue is doing it". Take decisions wisely.

* superstition 							  :Demo:noun:
  [2016-07-01 Fri 17:31]

  суеверие

  noun
  1. суеверие (superstition)
  2. религиозный предрассудок (superstition)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. excessively credulous belief in and reverence for supernatural beings.
     "he dismissed the ghost stories as mere superstition"


  A superstition is a belief or practice that isn’t entirely based on
  facts or reality, like carrying a rabbit’s foot because you think it
  brings you good fortune, or believing that Friday the 13th is a day
  of bad luck.

  When you pick up a penny, is it because you’re poor or do you think
  it’s lucky? If the quickest route makes you walk under a ladder,
  will you do it even though it’s bad luck? These are two examples of
  superstitions, irrational decisions we make for some weird reason.
  The Latin roots of the word translate as “standing over,” like how
  you freeze standing over a broken mirror. Don’t worry, it’s only a
  superstition, right?

  Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and
  superstition.

* begets							  :Demo:verb:
[2016-07-01 Fri 17:44]

To beget means to generate something, usually children, and it can be
used to refer to the role of either a mother or a father.

If we analyze the word beget, we get the prefix be-, which tends to
intensify the meaning of the following verb, and get, which means to
cause something to enter one's possession. The word is usually used to
refer to having children, although it can be used to refer to anything
that generates something else — for example, an inspiration can beget
a brilliant idea.

There are in fact two things, science and opinion;
the former begets knowledge, the latter ignorance.
* giddy							      :Demo:verb:adj:
[2016-07-01 Fri 17:52]

If you've ever spun in circles until you fell to the ground laughing,
you know how it feels to be giddy. This adjective can mean dizzy,
elated, or — as in the spinning around example –- a lightheaded,
lighthearted combination of the two.

The hackneyed phrase "giddy as a schoolgirl" calls forth the image of
a kid giggling with her friends over some adolescent
foolishness. Giddy has been used to describe someone incapable of
serious thought or easily excited as far back as the sixteenth
century. Given that, in modern usage, giddy describes someone silly
and frivolous, it's interesting to know that the Old English source
for this word has a slightly darker tinge: gidig means "insane" or
"god-possessed."

If anybody says he can think about quantum problems without getting giddy, that only shows he has not understood the first thing about them.
* lacs								  :Demo:noun:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:00]

Title: I am working in an MNC with a package of 3.4 lacs per annum. Can I earn upto 15 lacs per annum, inspite of being from a non IIT or non NIT college?
* hike							     :Demo:verb:noun:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:01]

To hike is to walk a long way at a leisurely pace. You might love to
hike in the woods on weekends.

When you hike, you walk for pleasure, often in a wooded or hilly
area. The trip itself is also a hike, whether you hike the Appalachian
Trail or climb a local hill. Another meaning of hike is "to increase,"
as when the library decides to hike the fees for late books. Hike has
been around since the 1800's, when it was spelled hyke, but its origin
is uncertain. The "walk vigorously" meaning is older than the "raise
or increase" meaning.

And it is happening with me. I was getting even lesser than you. I
asked for 30% hike but they said they can't give.
* fervently							   :Demo:adv:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:05]

If you fervently believe or feel something, then you believe or feel
it strongly — with a lot of passion.

People feel fervently about a lot of things. A sports fan may be
fervently supportive of a football or basketball team and go to every
game. Many religious people fervently believe in a god. If you're
extremely self-confident, you might fervently believe in
yourself. This word means a lot of passion is present. If you feel
blah about something, or you just like it a little, you don't
fervently believe in it.

But there were days I fervently wished for life before him. There were
days we'd broke down about it. There were nights I didn't want to get
up and walk the little guy back to sleep. And only until I accepted
and went through these things, did I find the joy and peace of my
situation. As he gets older, I slowly regain some freedoms I used to
have, and now I can thoroughly appreciate them, unlike before when I
didn't know a life without them.
* contemplation 						       :noun:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:20]

Contemplation is long, hard thinking about something. If you’re
writing a book on the meaning of the universe, then you’re going to
need to do a great deal of contemplation.

Contemplate has the word temple in its roots, and originally referred
to the kind of thinking you do in a special space set aside for
observation. Now we use it to describe any kind of thinking that we
spend a long time doing. While clicking on someone’s photos on
Facebook doesn’t count as contemplation, usually, you might spend
hours in contemplation of your family and your history if you come
across a box of old photos in the attic.

It is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, which, by often rumination, wraps me in a most humorous sadness.
* sundry						      :Demo:adj:noun:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:21]

A woman emptying out her purse after many years might find an old
stick of gum, a pair of broken sunglasses, a few movie tickets, and
sundry items, meaning that that her purse was filled with a random
collection of unrelated things.

Most people associate the word sundry with the old-fashioned drugstore
in their neighborhood that used to sell all sorts of odds and ends,
from magazines to hairbrushes. The word is typically used as an
adjective to describe a collection of various different items found in
one place, as in — "I discovered records, perfume bottles, and sundry
items at my neighbor's yard sale." The phrase "all and sundry" refers
collectively to a group of people, as in, "I invited all and sundry of
my relatives to my tea party."

It is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, which, by often rumination, wraps me in a most humorous sadness.
* rumination							  :Demo:noun:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:21]

If someone asks you to make a difficult decision — like what to have
for dinner — it might lead to rumination, or a long period of deep
thought.

Use the noun rumination when there's thoughtful consideration going
on. If your grandfather answers every question by saying, "Hmm. Let me
think about that," he is a fan of rumination. It comes from the verb
ruminate, which means "to think deeply," but also means "to chew the
cud." Both words come from the Latin word ruminatus, which has the
same meaning and which is rooted in rumen, or "gullet."

It is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, which, by often rumination, wraps me in a most humorous sadness.
* sojourn						     :Demo:noun:verb:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:23]

A sojourn is a short stay or visit. If you want a fancy way to say
that you took a trip to the countryside, you might talk about your
country sojourn.

The verb is originally from the Latin prefix sub- "under" plus diurnus
"of a day." You might refer to your vacation as a sojourn, but it
might make more sense if you are describing a trip to Provence rather
than a trip to Disney World. Or In figurative use, sojourn means to
delve––your math teacher may stop midway through lessons on fractions
for a brief sojourn into techniques for slicing pie.

THIS is the story of a five-year sojourn that I and my family made on the Greek island of Corfu. It was originally intended to be a mildly nostalgic account of the natural history of the island, but I made a grave mistake by introducing my family into the book in the first few pages. Having got themselves on paper, they then proceeded to establish themselves and invite various friends to share the chapters. It was only with the greatest difficulty, and by exercising considerable cunning, that I managed to retain a few pages here and there which I could devote exclusively to animals.
* cunning						      :Demo:adj:noun:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:35]

In fairy tales, always watch out for the cunning fox or the cunning
witch. Cunning means clever, in the sense of trickery. A cunning plan
might involve setting traps for the innocent and pure at heart to fall
into.

This adjective goes back to the 14th century English verb cunnen,
which meant "to know," and is actually related to our English verb
know. In earlier times, the noun was used to mean a high level of
skill in using the hands. You can be cunning, but you can also use
your cunning to figure out a very clever and tricky plan.

* considerable							   :Demo:adj:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:35]

Use the adjective considerable to describe something that is large in
amount. Things you probably spend a considerable amount of time on:
homework and laundry. Things you'd rather spend time on: anything that
isn't homework and laundry!

The adjective considerable can describe something of importance and is
worthy of notice or respect. If you are an excellent singer, dancer,
musician, writer, or similar profession, people may ask you to donate
your considerable talents to charitable causes. If you're not an
excellent singer, dancer, musician, or writer, they will still ask you
to donate, but they are more likely to ask for money!

* retain							  :Demo:verb:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:37]

Retain means to hold on to or keep. People who can retain a lot of
information are often mistaken for geniuses, but really they just have
very good memories.

To retain is to keep or maintain, whether in mind, possession or a
certain condition. If you have a great personal assistant, you'll
probably want to retain him for as long as you can. If your body is
retaining water you might look a little plump. The verbs restrain and
detain sound similar, but they mean to keep something by force.

* penetratingly							   :Demo:adv:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:40]
I have attempted to draw an accurate and unexaggerated picture of my family
in the following pages; they appear as I saw them. To explain some of their
more curious ways, however, I feel that I should state that at the time we 
were in Corfu the family were all quite young: Larry, the eldest, was 
twenty-three; Leslie was nineteen; Margo eighteen; while I was the youngest,
being of the tender and impressionable age of ten. We have never been very 
certain of my mother's age, for the simple reason that she can never remember 
her date of birth; all I can say is that she was old enough to have four children. 
My mother also insists that I explain that she is a widow for, as she so 
penetratingly observed, you never know what people might think.
* habitually							   :Demo:adv:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:45]

Your mind is on autopilot all the time and taking 5-10 minutes a day
to just separate from the neurotic mind is necessary save wasted
energy that goes into fantasizing and daydreaming and being habitually
negative.
* deserve							  :Demo:verb:
[2016-07-01 Fri 18:47]

We deserve things based on our actions. For example, many people
believe murderers deserve the death penalty.

Deserve is used in many ways, but it always carries a sense of balance
or justice. If someone receives an award for their work, it means they
deserve praise and attention. If you deserve a day off, it means
you've been working hard and have earned a vacation. If you threw a
book during class, you deserve a punishment of some kind. Many laws —
and lots of arguments — are about deciding what different people
deserve. It's often hard to tell.

No, instead, I'm going to tell you that in order to feel as good as
you know you want and deserve to feel EVERY DAMN DAY, you need to
exercise so that your body rewards you with happiness, literally. When
your body is happy YOU are happy. When your body is recharged through
exercising, so is your mind, so is your heart, and that energy pours
over into every single part of your life. Don't exercise because the
doctor and your parents tell you its necessary to live a long and
healthy life (obviously its important), but exercise because you want
to operate at maximum capacity on a daily basis, and exercising is
necessary to ensure that.

* savor							     :Demo:verb:noun:
[2016-07-02 Sat 17:11]

Whether it’s a feeling of joy or a piece of pecan pie — when you savor
something, you enjoy it to the fullest.

When you savor something, you enjoy it so much that you want to make
it last forever. With that in mind, savor carries a connotation of
doing something slowly. If you savor that flourless chocolate tart,
then you eat it slowly, bit by bit, deliberately picking every last
crumb off the plate. The word is often applied to eating, but you can
savor any pleasurable experience, whether it’s the winning touchdown
or your moment in the spotlight.

When going to bed do a quick mental check on the things you are
grateful for. I don't mean list them by rote.. I mean "savor" them. "I
am grateful my kids are healthy" "I am grateful I have a fabulous wife
who loves me" "I am grateful my job is close to where I live" "I am
grateful my doctor didn't see anything wrong with me" "I am grateful
for friend X"...
* blasphemy							  :Demo:noun:
[2016-07-02 Sat 17:16]

Saying offensive things about God or religion is blasphemy. Blasphemy
can be used for offensive ideas in other areas too.

If you're saying something bad about a god, or taking the Lord's name
in vain, or questioning a religious institution in any way, you could
be accused of blasphemy — insulting something sacred. You can use this
word in a lot of other ways too. At a meeting of conservatives, a
liberal idea could be considered blasphemy (and vice versa). You might
even jokingly cry "Blasphemy!" if a friend said your favorite ice
cream flavor stinks.

blasphemy
* soliciting						     :Demo:verb:noun:
[2016-07-02 Sat 17:17]

ходатайство

noun
 1. ходатайство (intercession, petition, motion, solicitation, soliciting, pleading)
 2. домогательство (soliciting, bid, exaction)
 3. выпрашивание (begging, soliciting)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. ask for or try to obtain (something) from someone.
    "he called a meeting to solicit their views"

Solicit means to ask for. It is what those people on the street are
doing, when they ask, "Do you have a moment to talk about the
destruction of the planet?" They are soliciting donations for their
cause.

Solicit has an official sounding impressiveness to it––doesn't
soliciting donations sound better than begging for money? It can also
have a more sinister cast. "When the teacher left the room, two girls
solicited their friends to throw all the textbooks out the windows,
injuring members of the cheer squad below — where they were soliciting
signatures for a petition banning smoking in the football locker
rooms."

If you're traveling to the US to do business (that is, making a sales
or professional visit), bear in mind that the attitude between
business associates is not like that found in Mediterranean, Hispanic
or Middle Eastern countries; it is more comparable to that of northern
Europeans. Whereas most Middle Eastern and many Hispanic business
hosts want to “get to know you” first, before doing business (asking
about your family, soliciting personal details, and very possibly
sharing a meal or at least coffee, so they can determine if you have
the kind of character worth doing business with), such personal
questions are considered peculiar, intrusive, and possibly even rude
to Americans. They are also unlikely to want or need to be given a
gift, as is customary in some countries. Like northern Europeans, they
are much more likely to get right down to business, without any
elaborate preliminaries or formalities.
* peculiar						      :Demo:adj:noun:
[2016-07-02 Sat 17:18]

своеобразный

adjective
 1. своеобразный (peculiar, singular, sui generis, idiomatic, idiomatical)
 2. специфический (specific, particular, peculiar, racy)
 3. особенный (special, particular, peculiar, especial, specific, individual)
 4. странный (strange, weird, odd, bizarre, curious, peculiar)
 5. характерный (characteristic, specific, distinctive, peculiar, representative, racy)
 6. необычный (unusual, extraordinary, odd, different, peculiar, exceptional)
 7. индивидуальный (individual, separate, special, particular, distinct, peculiar)
 8. специальный (special, ad hoc, technical, express, extra, peculiar)
 9. собственный (own, proper, peculiar)
10. эксцентричный (eccentric, bizarre, whimsical, queer, erratic, peculiar)
11. свойственный исключительно (peculiar)
12. отдельный (separate, individual, single, particular, distinct, peculiar)
13. личный (private, personal, individual, intimate, identity, peculiar)
14. частный (private, partial, particular, individual, proprietary, peculiar)
15. принадлежащий исключительно (peculiar)

noun
 1. личная собственность (peculiar)
 2. особая привилегия (peculiar)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. strange or odd; unusual.
    "his accent was a peculiar mixture of Cockney and Irish"
 2. belonging exclusively to.
    "the air hung with an antiseptic aroma peculiar to hospitals"

noun
 1. a parish or church exempt from the jurisdiction of the diocese in which it lies, through being subject to the jurisdiction of the monarch or an archbishop.
    "Yet others, founded by kings or bishops as their own, were later known as ‘ peculiars ’, withdrawn from ordinary diocesan jurisdiction."

Something peculiar is notably unusual. If your friend starts saying
strange things you don't understand, ask her why she's suddenly become
peculiar.

Peculiar comes from the Latin peculiaris, meaning one's own, or
personal.  In English, it originally meant belonging to one person,
private, like your fondness for your peculiar hairbrush.  It also had
the meaning of something unlike others, special, or
remarkable. Eventually we mostly stopped using it for belongings,
instead using peculiar to mean unusual or odd.

обычный

adjective
 1. привычный (habitual, familiar, accustomed, customary, regular, wonted)
 2. обычный (common, conventional, regular, normal, ordinary, customary)
 3. основанный на опыте (experiential, empirical, empiric, experimental, customary, a posteriori)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. according to the customs or usual practices associated with a particular society, place, or set of circumstances.
    "it is customary to mark an occasion like this with a toast"

Something customary is done according to practice. When a bride walks
down the aisle, it's customary for everyone at the wedding to rise out
of respect.

Every culture has its own customary traditions.  In American culture
it's customary for a child who loses a tooth to put it under her
pillow and wait for the Tooth Fairy to arrive. In Greece, on the other
hand, it's customary to throw a child's lost tooth onto the roof for
good luck. Customary can also reference habitual things a person does,
like taking your shoes off when you come home, or writing in your
diary before bed.

* niceties 							  :Demo:noun:

[2016-07-02 Sat 17:21]

тонкости

Clearly, you're interested in the nicety of a word's meaning if you're
checking out this website. A nicety is a fine detail or shade of
meaning that anything — not just a word — can possess.

Even the word nicety has niceties. The emphasis on detail can also
refer to a precision or accuracy of sorts; if someone has judged
something "to a nicety," they've judged it exactly. Yet another common
meaning is in the sense of a minor aspect of polite behavior. Washing
your hands before dinner is a "social nicety." So is covering your
mouth when you cough. Now where would we be without niceties?

Americans do not bow, nor do they normally kiss strangers. A simple
handshake is sufficient upon meeting a business associate; and even
that is unnecessary (and even considered strange) when dealing with
more transient and casual contacts (such as store clerks, hotel
clerks, waiters, cab drivers, etc.). It is sufficient just to say “Hi”
or “Good morning,” and state what you need. Most American service
personnel are used to such informal and abrupt contacts, and are not
offended by a lack of social niceties. HOWEVER – it is NEVER
acceptable to treat such people as your servants! Americans are quite
egalitarian, expect to be treated with a normal level of professional
dignity, and will not put up with ill treatment by a stranger. (And
their employers will usually back up the employee if a customer is
abusive.) If you physically strike a service person who has displeased
you, you may expect to be arrested for assault.
* egalitarian						      :Demo:adj:noun:
[2016-07-02 Sat 17:22]

уравнительный

adjective
 1. эгалитарный (egalitarian)
 2. уравнительный (egalitarian, countervailing)
 3. уравнительский (egalitarian)

noun
 1. эгалитарист (egalitarian)
 2. поборник равноправия (egalitarian)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. of, relating to, or believing in the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities.
    "a fairer, more egalitarian society"

noun
 1. a person who advocates or supports egalitarian principles.
    "Labour's long-term supporters, ethical socialists, public service workers, egalitarians and anti-monarchists, trade unionists and pacifists, were harder to deal with."

An egalitarian is a person who believes in the equality of all people,
and an egalitarian society gives everyone equal rights.

This is a word that means something close to equality and has to do
with fairness. If you believe that everyone deserves a chance to vote,
go to school, get good jobs, and participate in society, then you are
an egalitarian. When laws make life fairer, the law is getting more
egalitarian. The opposite of an egalitarian system could be a fascist
society or dictatorship. Monarchies are not egalitarian. When you see
this word, think about equality and freedom.

* courteously 							   :Demo:adv:
[2016-07-02 Sat 17:23]

учтиво

Women in the workforce are typically treated the same as men:
professionally, courteously and directly. Do not assume that a woman
who meets you for a business or professional appointment is merely a
secretary or assistant; she may be the boss! Treating her dismissively
or disdainfully will probably lose you business. Furthermore, bear in
mind that the US has strict prohibitions in law against sexual
harassment. Making suggestive comments, or unwanted physical contact,
can get you in trouble. The same is true of gay and lesbian people.

* dismissively							   :Demo:adv:
[2016-07-02 Sat 17:24]

пренебрежительно

To be dismissive is to be indifferent and a little rude. Being
dismissive is a sign of disrespect.

If you're dismissive, you show little consideration for others. If a
teacher laughs at a student's earnest answer to a question, that's
dismissive. An employer throwing a resume in the trash without reading
it? Dismissive. People are dismissive to others they think are beneath
them. You can also be dismissive to ideas and suggestions. It's like
waving someone or something away and saying, "whatever."

* disdainfully							   :Demo:adv:
[2016-07-02 Sat 17:24]

пренебрежительно

When you do something disdainfully, you do it with disapproval or
contempt. You might look disdainfully at an airplane passenger who's
yelling at his young son.

When you act disdainfully toward someone, you're expressing your lack
of respect — either for the person himself, or what he's doing. If
your grandmother disapproves of just about everyone she meets, she'll
probably glance disdainfully at your friends when they show up in
their loud car to pick you up. The Old French root of disdainfully is
desdeignier, "scorn, refuse, or repudiate," from des, "do the opposite
of," and deignier, "treat with respect."

лишения

noun
 1. лишения (privation, hardship, destitution, asperity)
 2. трудность (difficulty, hardship, intractability, severeness)
 3. лишение (deprivation, privation, hardship, destitution, divestment, divestiture)
 4. нужда (need, want, distress, poverty, necessity, hardship)
 5. тяжелое испытание (ordeal, hardship)
 6. неудобство (inconvenience, disadvantage, discomfort, nuisance, uneasiness, hardship)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. severe suffering or privation.
    "intolerable levels of hardship"

If something is a hardship, it causes suffering or
unpleasantness. After all the hardship you endured while training for
the marathon, you really hope that you’ll do well — or at least
finish!

The word hard in hardship is a tip-off to its meaning: something
that’s a hardship is hard. It could be hard work that you do for a
larger goal — like training for the marathon — or it could be a
situation that’s hard to endure. If you lose your job, you could end
up experiencing financial hardship. Sometimes a hardship is something
that just happens, like the hardship people suffer following a
disaster.

* liability							  :Demo:noun:

 1. ответственность (responsibility, liability, charge, accountability, blame, onus)

 4. склонность (tendency, propensity, inclination, penchant, addiction, liability)
 5. подверженность (liability, amenability)
 6. помеха (hindrance, noise, obstacle, impediment, nuisance, liability)
 7. долг (debt, duty, obligation, credit, trust, liability)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. the state of being responsible for something, especially by law.
    "the partners accept unlimited liability for any risks they undertake"
 2. a person or thing whose presence or behavior is likely to cause embarrassment or put one at a disadvantage.
    "he has become a political liability"

A liability is a debt or obligation or a personal flaw that stands in
your way. A company's liabilities are simply the debts on its ledger,
but a personal liability might be your extreme shyness in social
situations.

Depending on how you use it, the word liability has very different
meanings. In a business or financial sense, a liability is a debt or
fiscal obligation, like a mortgage or a loan. A limited liability
company means if the company fails, the partners are on the hook for
only what they initially invested in the company. A personal
liability, however, is some element of your past, your character, or
your behavior that might give you a disadvantage.

* crutch							  :Demo:noun:

 4. костыль больного (crutch)
 5. кормовой брештук (crutch)
 6. уключина (rowlock, oarlock, thole, crutch, tholepin)
 7. промежность (crotch, perineum, fork, crutch)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a long stick with a crosspiece at the top, used as a support under the armpit by a lame person.
    "It's difficult to understand why so many crutches , white sticks and wheelchairs remain unclaimed."

A crutch is something you lean on when you’re hurt or weak. It can be
a physical crutch you use because you broke your leg, or a friend you
depend on a bit too much when you’re having a tough time.

A medical crutch is a device that helps you walk when you’re
injured. A psychological crutch helps you when you need it, or think
you do. Medical crutches come in pairs and have soft pads that fit
under your arms and handles to help you rest your body weight on
them. Other types of crutches fit securely around the lower part of
your arm. The Old English root word is crycce, "staff," and the
figurative meaning dates from about 1600.

 2. капризный (capricious, whimsical, cranky, naughty, fractious, wayward)
 3. прихотливый (capricious, whimsical, fanciful, fancy, whimsy, arabesque)
 4. эксцентричный (eccentric, bizarre, whimsical, queer, erratic, kinky)
 5. фантастический (fantastic, fantastical, fancy, fanciful, visionary, whimsical)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. playfully quaint or fanciful, especially in an appealing and amusing way.
    "a whimsical sense of humor"
 2. acting or behaving in a capricious manner.
    "the whimsical arbitrariness of autocracy"

Whimsical means full of or characterized by whims, which are odd ideas
that usually occur to you very suddenly. If you decide at the last
minute to fly to Europe, you could say you went there on a whim.

Whimsical can also mean tending toward odd or unpredictable
behavior. Both whimsical and whim are derived from an earlier English
word whim-wham, which is of unknown origin. Whim-wham had about the
same meaning as whim, but could also refer to an odd object or piece
of clothing.

This book by Randall Munroe (which is actually a compilation of posts
from his wickedly popular blog xkcd) is equally whimsical and
informative. He explores questions like “from what height would you need
to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?” and “what
would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks,
where each brick was made of the corresponding element?” and he provides
explanations that are well-researched, sourced and scientifically valid,
while still using a giraffe as a measurement for height. You’ll be
entertained, and Mr. Gates says, “you’ll also learn about a lot of other
things like ballistics, DNA, the oceans, the atmosphere and lightning.”

* plea								  :Demo:noun:
[2016-07-08 Fri 14:30]

мольба

noun
 1. заявление (statement, application, declaration, claim, allegation, plea)
 2. просьба (request, application, plea, petition, wish, entreaty)
 3. призыв (call, appeal, plea, exhortation, draft, slogan)
 4. мольба (pleading, plea, supplication, prayer, entreaty, cry)
 5. довод (argument, reason, plea, cause)
 6. ссылка (link, reference, exile, ref, citation, plea)
 7. оправдание (justification, excuse, acquittal, defense, vindication, plea)
 8. жалоба (complaint, appeal, claim, grievance, plaint, plea)
 9. предлог (pretext, excuse, preposition, guise, plea, cloak)
10. заявление подсудимого (plea)
11. иск по суду (plea)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a request made in an urgent and emotional manner.
    "he made a dramatic plea for disarmament"
 2. a formal statement by or on behalf of a defendant or prisoner, stating guilt or innocence in response to a charge, offering an allegation of fact, or claiming that a point of law should apply.
    "he changed his plea to not guilty"

A plea is what you make when you're begging for something with a sense
of urgency and emotion. While you wouldn't call asking for a hall pass
a plea, you could make a plea for justice or world peace.

Plea also has a legal meaning. When you get a traffic ticket or if
you're accused of a crime, you have to enter a plea of "guilty" or
"not guilty." A "plea bargain" is when you make a deal with the
prosecutor — you may plead guilty to a charge (by entering a guilty
plea) that has less of a penalty and, in return, the prosecutor drops
the more serious charge.

In this Richard Dawkins book, he poses a question at the beginning of
each chapter, offers colorful myths from different places around the
world and finally reveals an elegant scientific answer. “It’s an
engaging, well-illustrated science textbook offering compelling answers
to big questions, from how the universe formed to what causes
earthquakes,” Mr. Gates writes in his review. “It’s also a plea for
readers of all ages to approach mysteries with rigor and curiosity,
rather than buying into the supernatural myths at the core of most faith
traditions.”

* amend								  :Demo:verb:
[2016-07-08 Fri 20:09]

изменить

verb
 1. вносить поправки (amend)
 2. исправлять (correct, fix, mend, rectify, repair, amend)
 3. улучшать (improve, better, refine, perfect, improve on, amend)
 4. чинить (repair, fix, mend, darn, bodge, amend)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. make minor changes in (a text) in order to make it fairer, more accurate, or more up-to-date.
    "the rule was amended to apply only to nonmembers"

When you amend something, you correct or improve it. If you confused
your audience when you gave your speech, don't be afraid to amend what
you said.

Amend can also describe adding amendments to an official document,
such as a constitution or law. If politicians in your state want to
address the growing number of home foreclosures, they might amend the
state constitution to include restrictions intended to reduce
foreclosures. Amend comes from the Latin word emendare, meaning "to
correct, free from fault."

* amendment

поправка

noun
 1. поправка (amendment, correction, modification, corrective, rectification, rider)
 2. изменение (change, variation, modification, alteration, shift, amendment)
 3. исправление (correction, rectification, repair, redress, amendment, reformation)
 4. редакция (editorial office, wording, redaction, release, formulation, amendment)
 5. поправка к закону (amendment)
 6. улучшение (improvement, enhancement, betterment, amelioration, development, amendment)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a minor change in a document.
    "Had he been told about this, he would have made the necessary amendments to the sale documents to reflect that fact."

* deceive							  :Demo:verb:
[2016-07-08 Fri 20:10]

To deceive means to trick or lie. A crafty kid might deceive his
mother into thinking he has a fever by holding the thermometer to a
light bulb to increase the temperature.

Deceive is the trickier cousin of lie. You might lie about why you
were late to school. But if you simply don't explain to your mom that
you were late in the first place, you are deceiving her. Deceive
carries with it a feeling of both craftiness and betrayal. When you
deceive someone, forgiveness can be hard to come by. Have you heard of
the spelling rule, "i before e except after c" that has so many
exceptions? Well, deceive follows that rule.

deceive
* profanity							  :Demo:noun:
[2016-07-08 Fri 20:25]

Profanity is a type of language that includes dirty words and
ideas. Swear words, obscene gestures, and naughty jokes are all
considered profanity.

You know those four-letter words you're not supposed to say? They're
profanity: language that's vulgar and obscene. R-rated movies and
cable stations like HBO have a lot of profanity, but you won't hear it
on a station like NBC or ABC. Profanity tends to be about off-color
subjects, like sex and going to the bathroom. Everyone probably spews
some profanity at some point, but you better be careful about who's
listening.

profanity
* outburst							  :Demo:noun:
[2016-07-08 Fri 20:26]

When you can't help an angry shout or a burst of emotion, that's an
outburst. A toddler's outburst might take the form of a full-blown
temper tantrum.

An outburst of passion or emotion can be angry words, a broken glass,
or a triumphant whoop. There are also figurative outbursts, like the
outburst of political enthusiasm within a particular group of voters,
or an outburst of energy in the midst of a modern dance
performance. The Middle English verb that proceeded outburst was
outbresten.

"an outburst of profanity"

* obscene							   :Demo:adj:
[2016-07-08 Fri 20:28]

Obscene describes something that is morally offensive in a sexual
way. It's never a good idea to use obscene language at school.

Certain films, books, magazines, and other forms of entertainment are
considered obscene because they portray sex in a very frank way that
some people find vulgar and lewd. Obscene material, language, and
jokes are considered taboo in polite society. Obscene can also be used
to describe something repulsive — like when your friend ate an obscene
number of snails at the Bastille Day bash.

obscene
* decency							  :Demo:noun:
[2016-07-08 Fri 20:29]

The personal quality of decency is one of honesty, good manners, and
respect for other people.

Over time, decency has referred to manners, but today decency is
mainly a strong sense of right and wrong, and a high standard of
honesty. When a criminal or dictator does horrible things, people
assume they have no sense of decency. When a tasteless or violent TV
show becomes popular, some people wonder if society has lost its sense
of decency. Asking "Have you no decency?" is a serious question,
unless you're being silly and complaining about something like
homework.

decency
* unjust							   :Demo:adj:
[2016-07-08 Fri 20:29]

Something or someone that is unjust is just not fair. An unjust boss
might fire you the very first time you're late for work.

You might think of the word justice in order to remember the meaning
of the word just, which means "fairness or righteousness." An unjust
judge does not play by the rules; he might send a person to jail even
though there isn't enough evidence that a crime was committed. Unjust
behavior is improper or dishonest: "The professor acted in an unjust
manner when he gave everyone an F just because there was a rumor that
his students didn’t like him."

unjust
* infuriating						      :Demo:adj:verb:
[2016-07-08 Fri 20:30]

Use the adjective infuriating to describe something that makes you
really, really angry. It's infuriating to see a little kid being
bullied.

When something makes you furious it's infuriating. You can use the
word to talk about things that are truly offensive or outrageous —
someone snatching your grandmother's purse, for example — or things
that are merely aggravating or annoying. You might find it infuriating
trying to parallel park on a busy street or waiting in line at the
post office. The roots of infuriating can be traced all the way back
to the Latin furere, which means "to rage" or "to be mad."

infuriating
* hapless							   :Demo:adj:
[2016-07-08 Fri 20:31]

Use the adjective hapless to describe someone unlucky and deserving of
pity, like the hapless used car buyer who gives in to the fast-talking
salesperson.

The word hapless traces all the way back to the Old Norse word happ,
meaning “chance, good luck.” Combine this with the suffix -less
(“lacking”) and hapless means “unlucky” or “ill-fated.”  A traveler
who goes to Moscow and briefly gets lost on the subway? Just a
tourist. A traveler who goes to Moscow, accidentally eats food he is
allergic to, somehow loses all his money, and by chance gets on a
train destined for Mongolia? Definitely hapless.

hapless
* inflict							  :Demo:verb:
[2016-07-08 Fri 20:32]

When you force an undesirable or harmful event on someone, you inflict
it on them. You might prefer that someone inflict some physical pain
on you rather than inflict you with the boredom of another trip to the
annual flower show.

The verb inflict comes from the Latin word inflictus, meaning “to
strike or dash against.” If you cause anything bad to happen to a
person, animal, or even an object, you inflict that badness on
them. For example, someone can inflict injuries or suffering on other
people or inflict damage on property. We can inflict pollution or
over-development on our environment. It's always a negative thing —
you wouldn't say you inflict happiness or love on others.

inflict
* muggy								   :Demo:adj:
[2016-07-08 Fri 20:33]

Think of hot, humid, steamy weather as being so unpleasant that you
feel "mugged" by it when you step outside. That's one way to remember
the meaning of muggy.

"It's not the heat! It's the humidity!" That's what your grandma says
when she wants to complain about muggy weather. Muggy means a
combination of humidity and heat that makes you sweaty and
uncomfortable and long for air-conditioning. You might be cursing the
cold and the snow today, but mark my words, come August and the muggy
dog days of summer, you'll be nostalgic for the cold.

muggy

* generosity							  :Demo:noun:
[2016-07-10 Sun 11:46]

Generosity is a quality that's a lot like unselfishness. Someone
showing generosity is happy to give time, money, food, or kindness to
people in need.

Generosity is a quality — like honesty and patience — that we all
probably wish we had more of. When you show generosity, you might give
away things or money or put others before yourself.  But generosity is
about more than cash and stuff. When you're forgiving and gentle to
people, you show generosity of spirit. If you give others help or
credit, that shows generosity. The world would certainly be a better
place if more people showed generosity to others.

My grateful thanks, then, to:
    Dr Theodore Stephanides. With typical generosity, he allowed me to make use of material from his unpublished work on Corfu, and supplied me with a number of dreadful puns, some of which I have used.
* puns							     :Demo:noun:verb:
[2016-07-10 Sun 11:47]

A pun is a play on words. If a bird flying overhead takes a poop on
the cake you’re carrying, you could say “Isn’t that just the icing on
the cake!” But only if you want to be punny.

Friend of the double entendre and other witticisms, a pun is a comedic
phrase that plays off of the sounds and double meanings of words. Puns
can be quite clever, but often come off as silly, cheeseball attempts
at humor. That's probably why any good comedian will tell you that "a
pun is a short quip followed by a long groan."

My grateful thanks, then, to:
    Dr Theodore Stephanides. With typical generosity, he allowed me to make use of material from his unpublished work on Corfu, and supplied me with a number of dreadful puns, some of which I have used.
* dreadful							   :Demo:adj:
[2016-07-10 Sun 11:47]

Something that's terribly bad is dreadful. Some people love going to
the opera, but for others there's no more dreadful way to spend three
hours.

Dreadful means "full of dread," "feeling a sense of dread," or
"causing dread." Dread means fear or anxiety. The adjective dreadful
can describe something truly devastating, like the dreadful aftermath
of a tornado, or something that's awful on a more personal level, like
a dreadful blind date. If it's bad, fearsome, or unpleasant, you can
call it dreadful.

My grateful thanks, then, to:
    Dr Theodore Stephanides. With typical generosity, he allowed me to make use of material from his unpublished work on Corfu, and supplied me with a number of dreadful puns, some of which I have used.
* unconsciously							   :Demo:adv:
[2016-07-10 Sun 11:51]
бессознательно

adverb
 1. бессознательно (unconsciously)

My family. They, after all, unconsciously provided a lot of the material, and helped me considerably during the writing of the book by arguing ferociously and rarely agreeing about any incident on which I consulted them.

* ruthless							 :Family:adj:
[2016-07-10 Sun 11:57]

Ruthless means showing no mercy or compassion. If you really want to
cut down on the clutter in your apartment, you can't be sentimental
about keepsakes. You have to be ruthless and throw out everything
that's not absolutely essential.

If you're ruthless, you're the polar opposite of Mother Theresa. You
get called heartless and cold-blooded. That's one of the reasons the
word crops up so often to describe dictators and tyrants, though it
can also apply to other personality types — like corporate raiders and
colleagues so success-driven that they'll gladly steamroll anyone to
get ahead. It finds its way into milder contexts, too: Just be
ruthless and rip off the Band-Aid already!

Sophie, my secretary, who was responsible for the introduction of commas and the ruthless eradication of the split infinitive.
* eradication							:Family:noun:
[2016-07-10 Sun 11:57]

When people talk about the eradication of something, they are
referring to its total destruction. Imagine a movie villain destroying
a planet with a massive laser beam and you'll have the right idea.

If a gardener's goal is the eradication of every single weed in his
back yard, he might start by uprooting dandelions. Fittingly, the root
of eradication is the Latin word for "uproot," ērādīcāre. The
eradication of anything, whether it's disease, poverty, war, or weeds,
involves removing every last trace of it, right down to the roots.

Sophie, my secretary, who was responsible for the introduction of commas and the ruthless eradication of the split infinitive.
* intact							 :Family:adj:
[2016-07-10 Sun 12:24]

If something is intact it's still in one piece. If you'd like your
sand castle to remain intact, I suggest you build it away from the
water.

The Latin word intactus means “untouched,” but today something is
intact if it's whole, if it hasn't fallen apart. After a long day at
work, you might feel lucky to be intact. Your letter to the post
office states that you would prefer your packages to arrive intact
from now on.

I should like to pay a special tribute to my mother, to whom this book is dedicated. Like a gentle, enthusiastic, and understanding Noah, she has steered her vessel full of strange progeny through the stormy seas of life with great skill, always faced with the possibility of mutiny, always surrounded by the dangerous shoals of overdraft and extravagance, never being sure that her navigation would be approved by the crew, but certain that she would be blamed for anything that went wrong. That she survived the voyage is a miracle, but survive it she did, and, moreover, with her reason more or less intact. As my brother Larry rightly points out, we can be proud of the way we have brought her up; she is a credit to us. That she has reached that happy Nirvana where nothing shocks or startles is exemplified by the fact that one week-end recently, when all alone in the house, she was treated to the sudden arrival of a series of crates containing two pelicans, a scarlet ibis, a vulture, and eight monkeys. A lesser mortal might have quailed at such a contingency, but not Mother. On Monday morning I found her in the garage being pursued round and round by an irate pelican which she was trying to feed with sardines from a tin.
* crate 						   :Family:noun:verb:
[2016-07-10 Sun 12:37]

A crate is a wooden container that's made for transporting or shipping
goods. Your uncle might send you a crate of Florida oranges for a
Christmas gift.

Boxes made of wood that are filled with goods and loaded on trucks,
ships, or planes are called crates, and to fill them is also to
crate. Groceries are often shipped or delivered in crates, like crates
of eggs, milk crates, or a crate of bananas. The amount of some item
that fits in one crate is also called a crate — "The market ordered
seven crates of ice cream for the Fourth of July weekend."

I should like to pay a special tribute to my mother, to whom this book is dedicated. Like a gentle, enthusiastic, and understanding Noah, she has steered her vessel full of strange progeny through the stormy seas of life with great skill, always faced with the possibility of mutiny, always surrounded by the dangerous shoals of overdraft and extravagance, never being sure that her navigation would be approved by the crew, but certain that she would be blamed for anything that went wrong.

* quailed							:Family:verb:
[2016-07-10 Sun 12:38]

Smaller than the chicken and not as well known as the pigeon, quail is
like the often-overlooked middle child of the ground-dwelling bird
family. Quail can also mean to cringe in fear or pain. So if you are a
quail, you might quail at the thought of quail-hunting season.

Quail is a broad, catchall word; it can refer to any one of many small
domestic game birds.  So if you’re bragging about the quail you shot
on a hunting trip to your uptight, bird-obsessed pals, they might
demand to know if it was the Bobwhite quail, the Valley quail or the
Scaled quail, to name just a few. If you use this word as a verb, it
means to draw back in fear or pain. You might quail in fear at the
sight of a playground bully. A good way to remember this verb meaning
is to think of how the word chicken is also associated with fear.

I should like to pay a special tribute to my mother, to whom this book is dedicated.

* contingency							:Family:noun:
[2016-07-10 Sun 12:40]

If you plan to walk home if the weather is nice, but bring subway fare
just in case, then taking the subway is your contingency plan. A
contingency is an event you can't be sure will happen or not.

The noun contingency describes something that might or might not
happen. We use it to describe an event or situation that is a possible
outcome but one that's impossible to predict with certainty. A company
might have a contingency plan for what to do if something goes wrong
with their primary strategy, also known as "plan B." They might even
have plans C, D, and E, to prepare for multiple contingencies.

* flamboyant							 :Family:adj:
[2016-07-10 Sun 12:46]

Flamboyant means elaborate and ostentatious. When you think of
flamboyant, think of Las Vegas showgirls: feathers, sequins,
three-inch heels, enough make-up to disguise any irregularity.

Flamboyant means showy, and though we often roll our eyes at it, it's
not a hateful thing. Liberace was flamboyant. So was Elvis. The word
comes from the French flamboyer, to flame. Think of passion and
pageantry all rolled into one, and you'll have a good idea what
flamboyant should mean at its best. If that doesn't do it for you,
think of a man playing a shiny white grand piano at a rock concert,
wearing a white satin jump suit and 8-foot wide, fully-feathered
wings. See? Flamboyant.

Lastly, I would like to make a point of stressing that all the anecdotes about the island and the islanders are absolutely true. Living in Corfu was rather like living in one of the more flamboyant and slapstick comic operas. The whole atmosphere and charm of the place was, I think, summed up neatly on an Admiralty map we had, which showed the island and the adjacent coastline in great detail. At the bottom was a little inset which read:
    CAUTION: AS the buoys marking the shoals are often out of position, mariners are cautioned to be on their guard when navigating these shores.

 2. хлопушка (slapstick, flapper, petard, flap)
 3. дешевый фарс (slapstick comedy, slapstick)
 4. грубый фарс (slapstick comedy, knockabout, slapstick)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. comedy based on deliberately clumsy actions and humorously embarrassing events.
    "slapstick humor"

* adjacent							 :Family:adj:
[2016-07-10 Sun 12:49]

Adjacent means close to or near something. You may consider the people
up and down your street to be neighbors, but your next-door neighbor
is the person who lives in the house or apartment adjacent to yours.

Adjacent can refer to two things that touch each other or have the
same wall or border. And the adjective is often followed by the
preposition to: Her office is adjacent to mine. This word is from
Latin adjacere "to lie near," from the prefix ad- "to" plus jacere "to
lie, throw."

* rusty								   :Demo:adj:
[2016-07-11 Mon 06:04]

If your German is rusty, it's like the bike you left out in the rain
too many times that turned brown and flakey on the metal parts. Like
your bike, your German skills became rusty, meaning they're suffering
from neglect.

You can also describe yourself as rusty: you used to do flips on your
skateboard, but you haven't practiced in a while and now you're a
little rusty. Rusty can also refer to the color of rust, which is a
reddish-brown — a rusty-colored dog, for instance. Anything made of
iron or steel that you leave outside in the elements is likely to
oxidize and become rusty, covered with rust.

The skills are rusty, but the knowledge is still there. I'm ready for
the zombie apocalypse.

* reinforce :Demo:
[2016-07-15 Fri 18:31]

To reinforce means to make stronger. You can reinforce your roof by
putting some extra supports under it.

Besides a physical structure, there are many things you can
reinforce. If you want to reinforce a message, you can say it louder,
rephrase and repeat it or give examples of what you expect. You use
dog biscuits to reinforce certain behaviors in your dog. Bad
experiences will reinforce your fears, good ones your hopes. And when
military leaders reinforce their troops, they send additional soldiers
to the front.

Anything you reinforce. So.

* glowing							  :Quora:adj:
[2016-07-15 Fri 18:39]

If something is glowing, it's either lit up like a light or it's full
of praise and enthusiasm. So, you could receive a glowing candle or a
glowing report card. You choose.

When a report or account is glowing, it's unreservedly positive, like
a book critic's glowing review of a new mystery novel or your
grandmother's glowing praise for the good job you did mowing her
lawn. Glowing comes from glow, which can mean "a flush of radiant
feeling," and which comes from the Old English glowan, "to glow or
shine as if red-hot."

Any major work experience (a Job) is considered an Excellent
extracurricular activity, as long as you get a glowing letter of

[2016-07-15 Fri 18:42]

Praise means "admiration or approval," and when you're on the
receiving end of it, you feel great.

Whether it's used as a verb or a noun, praise means "approval." If you
enthusiastically praise your dog, he's likely to wag his tail and
expect a treat. What you've given him (in addition to the treat) is
praise, the noun. In a religious context, the verb praise is
interchangeable with worship, as when a minister says, "Praise God."

verb
 1. хвалить (praise, commend, compliment, laud, talk up, glorify)
 2. восхвалять (praise, eulogize, magnify, exalt, sing the praises of, glamorize)
 3. превозносить (exalt, praise, extol, glorify, laud, eulogize)

* toughy							 :Quora:noun:

 2. трудная проблема (toughy, toughie)
 3. непокладистый человек (tough customer, toughie, toughy)

 5. хулиган (bully, hooligan, hoodlum, ruffian, tough, toughie)

* refinement							   :LPT:noun:
[2016-07-16 Sat 08:49]

Do you know which fork is for your salad and which one is for dessert?
Then you have some refinement — good manners and taste.

Things that go through a process of refinement have been refined;
they've lost their rough edges. For people, this means they have good
manners, and for substances like oil and sugar, it means that their
impurities have been removed. With refinement, things and people
become more acceptable: the sugar's refinement makes it appropriate to
serve at a fancy party, and your refinement makes you a perfect guest
there.

This gives you a pretty basic understanding of what we'll be talking
about in this book. There are many refinements and tools to make the
process quicker and easier, but the basic idea is to tell the computer
what you expect, using simple and easily-written chunks of code, and then
tell the computer to double-check your expectations throughout the coding
process. Because expectations are easy to describe, you can write them
down first, allowing the computer to shoulder much of the burden of
debugging your code. Because expectations are easy to describe, you can
write them down fast, allowing you to move on to interesting things while
the computer keeps track of the rest.

* lure							      :LPT:verb:noun:
[2016-07-16 Sat 08:57]

To lure is to entice or bait someone.  A lure is used to bait or
entice fish to attach themselves to your hook.  "He had a new shiny
lure, which was enough to lure me into going on the fishing trip."

The verb lure is related to words that mean “bait,” “deceit,” and
“invite.”  Often, when lure is used, there is a nefarious implication,
as in: “He was able to lure her into the alley, but her friends soon
came looking for her.”  The noun lure is the thing that draws in the
person or animal, which can be either a physical object or a concept.
"The lure of his great wealth kept her in the relationship despite his
infidelity."

For this reason, newcomers to automated testing are sometimes lured into
ignoring the distinction between unit testing and integration testing.

* encompass							   :verb:LPT:
[2016-07-16 Sat 08:58]

Encompass means to contain. When you see the word, picture a campus
which encompasses lecture halls, a football field, a medical center, a
dining hall and some parking lots.

Encompass can be used when talking about anything that contains
something else. A lecture on Edward Hopper might encompass all aspects
of his life and art, a work of art could encompass many techniques,
and a policeman's jurisdiction may encompass an entire state. The
continental U.S. encompasses 48 states. This entry encompasses many
examples of the word encompass in use!

In integration testing, the boundaries of isolation are pushed further
back, so that the tests encompass the interactions between related units.

* shoulder :LPT:
[2016-07-16 Sat 09:09]

noun
 1. the upper joint of the human arm and the part of the body between this and the neck.
    "Occasionally it starts in one region such as the neck and shoulders and spreads over a period of time."
 2. a part of something resembling a shoulder in shape, position, or function.
    "the shoulder of a pulley"
 3. a paved strip alongside a road for stopping on in an emergency.
    "My partner and I had parked on the shoulder of the highway and began to chat."

verb
 1. put (something heavy) over one's shoulder or shoulders to carry.
    "we shouldered our crippling backpacks and set off slowly up the hill"
 2. push (someone or something) out of one's way with one's shoulder.
    "she shouldered him brusquely aside"

 1. legal; conforming to the rules.
    "is this car legit?"

Title: Is Udacity's job placement guarantee legit?

* eligible :Quora:
[2016-07-16 Sat 09:39]

If you get good grades, volunteer at the hospital, play varsity
sports, and write for your school paper, you might be eligible for a
college scholarship.

If you’re eligible for something, you’re either qualified for it or
allowed to do it. You’re eligible for unemployment benefits if you’ve
recently been laid off, but not if you've never had a job in the first
place. You may not be eligible to enter a sweepstakes if you work for
the company giving away the money. Neither your dog nor your friend
from Australia is eligible to run for president of the United States,
but you might be!

Like these programs, Udacity's program has the limitation that you
must be able to work in the United States (so only 5% of people are
even eligible).

 1. выброшенный (ejected, discarded, rejected)
 2. выкинутый (ejected, discarded, rejected)

* noble :Quora:
[2016-07-16 Sat 12:38]

A noble is a titled peer of the realm or an aristocrat. As an
adjective, noble describes someone with high or elevated character, or
who is impressive in appearance.

From feudal times, we have known nobles as the heirs to thrones or as
the holders of aristocratic title. British aristocracy, for example,
produces many people of various noble titles, including dukes, earls,
princes, kings, and queens. As various royal histories tell us,
however, many of these nobles in title weren't quite so noble in
character.

Tywin understands, and so does Tyrion. that killing 10,000 men in
battle is not noble.

* hangover 							      :Quora:
[2016-07-19 Tue 18:51]

noun
 1. a severe headache or other after effects caused by drinking an excess of alcohol.
    "These side-effects are far more severe than a hangover and can act as a strong deterrent to drinking."

* commitment :Quora:
[2016-07-19 Tue 18:33]

Making a commitment involves dedicating yourself to something, like a
person or a cause. Before you make a commitment, think carefully. A
commitment obligates you to do something.

Some commitments are large, like marriage. When you take a job, you're
making a commitment to show up and do the job well, and your employer
makes a commitment to pay you. There are smaller commitments too. If
you said you'd meet a friend at six, that's a commitment  show up or
your friend will be mad. You also can speak of commitment as a
quality. Staying after school for a study group shows your commitment
to good grades.

7. Love is a broad spectrum - Love is a commitment. Love is being
there for someone when things go south. Love is making adjustments and
compromising.

* asset :Quora:
[2016-07-19 Tue 19:02]

An asset is something you have that is positive. It can mean a piece
of property, a piece of equipment, an ability, or even a quality.

"Her facility with math is an asset when it comes to figuring out the
restaurant tab. She is an asset to the group." A person's overall
financial picture is determined by lining up everything they own in
the asset column, and everything they own in the liability (or debit)
column.

In terms of humility, depending on your educational background, you
may end up in a situation where you feel intellectually ahead of some
of your more experienced colleagues, or more familiar with modern
technology, or so forth. But there is also a lot you can learn from
your colleagues and being a friendly and humble person to work with is
always an asset.
* groove :Quora:
[2016-07-19 Tue 19:07]

A groove is an indentation or rut in something — like the grooves on
an old record.

Groove is rooted in an old Dutch word for "furrow" or "ditch." And
that's just what a groove is: a carved out line, like wheel ruts in a
muddy road or the narrow opening that a sliding door moves in. If you
can't "find your groove," you feel off track and out of whack. But
when you're "in the groove," everything is working smoothly and you've
found a good routine. And if someone says "let's groove!", they want
to dance.

She did not just tell me. She actually made me repeat after her
several times, so it wore a groove.
* dorm :Quora:
[2016-07-19 Tue 19:09]

A dorm — short for dormitory — is a place where college or university
students live. You'll find a lot of bunk beds in most dorms.

If you go away to college, you’ll probably live in a dormitory — or
dorm. It's much more common for students to say dorm because it's
shorter and slangier. A dorm is where students live, often with
roommates. Dorms have laundry rooms and rec rooms, and it's a place
where many friendships are made. Students often study or try to avoid
studying in the dorm. It's their home away from home. Dorms are also
called residence halls and student residences.

When I was 18, I was a full-time college student. I was living in a
dorm on campus, about an hour and a half away from my hometown. I
worked a minimum wage job washing dishes in the cafeteria when I was
at school, and I worked at the McDonald's in my hometown when I was
there for breaks. I was still financially dependent on my parents.

* hookup 							      :Quora:

 1. a connection to a public electric, water, or sewer line, or to a similar service.
    "the campground has 70 sites with water and sewer hookups"

* sewer :Quora:
[2016-07-19 Tue 19:16]

noun
 1. an underground conduit for carrying off drainage water and waste matter.
    "A common problem is the unlawful channelling of storm water drainage into the sewer system."
 2. a person who sews.
    "Irene Caldwell is the company's costume designer who works with a small group of budding sewers ."

* poultry :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 08:56]

noun
 1. domestic fowl, such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese.
    "Specific arrangements may need to be put in place for poultry , horses, fish and exotic livestock."

From the perspective of the poultry farmer, male chickens are useless.
* ornery :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 08:57]

To be ornery is to be grumpy and hard to please. Oscar the Grouch?
Definitely ornery.

The adjective ornery sprung up in the early 19th century when people
started pronouncing ordinary with an accent.  The root of ordinary is
the Latin word for “order,” and if you disrupt the orderly existence
of an ornery person, prepare to get yelled at.  A person can have a
consistently ornery personality, or maybe you’re feeling ornery today
because you skipped breakfast.  Some synonyms for ornery are
cantankerous and crotchety, words that sound as grumpy as the people
they describe.

* vexed :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 08:59]

Vexed means "difficult and much debated." If your family is having
trouble coming to an agreement about where to go on vacation next
summer, your holiday trip has become a vexed issue.

When people can't resolve an issue or find a solution, it is a vexed
problem — one that's become complicated because of differing and
probably strong opinions. Vexed can also describe being irritated. If
you borrowed your sister's car without asking permission, and if she
had a fancy way of putting things, she might tell you she's incredibly
vexed with you right now.

* divulge :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 09:01]

If you've been sneaking around with your best friend's boyfriend,
that's probably one secret you don't want to divulge, because
revealing that tidbit of information will probably cut your friendship
short.

Divulge often precedes the word secret, because it means to reveal
something, and that something is often of a personal or private
nature. A gossip columnist's job is to divulge which celebrities are
secretly dating and which ones have been caught in embarrassing
situations. Although the word comes from the Latin word for making
something public to the masses, it can also be used to describe
information passed from one person to another. For example, a mother
could divulge to her daughter that she was adopted.

* unveiled :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 09:43]

verb
 1. remove a veil or covering from, especially uncover (a new monument or work of art) as part of a public ceremony.
    "the mayor unveiled a plaque"

* dexterity :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 09:48]

If you fall asleep with your heavy head on your arm, you might not
have the dexterity, or control of your hand, to hit the OFF button on
the alarm clock in the morning.

Very small children do well with mittens, because their dexterity, or
skill in using their hands, isn’t as developed as in older kids and
adults, who wear gloves to separate their fingers. Dexterity helps
fingers and hands to coordinate for completing fine tasks like
writing, sewing, and playing string instruments. "Mental dexterity"
means a sharpness of mind, or skill in thinking creatively and
understanding and expressing something quickly and easily.

* convex :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 09:50]

If something is bulging outwards in a curve, it's convex in shape. The
surface of a soccer balls, old television screens, and eyeballs are
all convex in shape.

One of the most famous uses of a convex shape are the curving mirrors
in a fun house. Not to be confused with its popular partner, the
concave mirror, which curves inwards. How can you tell which is which?
If you look like you're three feet tall and weigh 300 pounds, you're
looking in a convex mirror. If you look like you're twelve feet tall
weigh 30 pounds, you're looking in a concave mirror. Enjoy!

* concave :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 09:51]

Concave describes an inward curve; its opposite, convex, describes a
curve that bulges outward. They are used to describe gentle, subtle
curves, like the kinds found in mirrors or lenses.

A valley is a concave curve, a mountain is a convex curve—you can
remember this by thinking that things that vex you tend to stick out,
and that caves tend to be holes that go in, like valleys or innie
belly buttons. If you want to describe a bowl, you might say there is
a large blue spot on the center of the concave side.

* bead :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 09:52]

A bead is a small bauble or jewel with a hole through its middle for
stringing on a necklace or bracelet. You can make your own jewelry by
stringing colorful beads on a long cord.

Beads are decorative balls made from stone, glass, or plastic. Rosary
beads — or other prayer beads — are used for praying or meditating,
and in some societies beads are the equivalent of money, used as
currency to buy things. You can also describe a round drop of liquid
as a bead, like a bead of sweat on your forehead. The earliest meaning
of bead is "prayer bead," from the Old English gebed, "prayer."

* captivating :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 09:54]

The adjective captivating describes something that's completely
enthralling and holds your attention. You might find a marathon of
episodes of a TV show so captivating that you forget to eat dinner.

When people are captivating, they're often very intelligent,
attractive, charming, or otherwise fascinating. Something that catches
and holds your interest is captivating, like a captivating mystery
novel you just can't put down. In fact, this adjective comes from the
Latin captivatus, "to take or capture," and early in its use,
captivating had that literal meaning. Now it's only used to mean
capturing interest.

* perceives :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 09:56]

When we perceive something, we become aware of or notice it. Sometimes
we perceive things by using our senses of sight, hearing, and smell.

Or we can use our mind to perceive things, which means that we are
able to recognize or understand them. We can also perceive a person or
thing as having certain qualities: Do you perceive yourself as a good
student? The Latin root percipere means "to receive, understand," from
the prefix per- "thoroughly" plus capere "to seize, take."

* plush :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 10:05]

Things that are plush are luxurious and a little over the top. A
bedspread made of mink fur would be considered plush.

Plush originally referred to a rich, soft type of fabric, and it’s now
used to describe anything extravagant. A plush lifestyle is one only
the wealthy can afford, with expensive restaurants, obedient servants,
and fancy furniture. A plush living room is full of paintings and
decorations. Someone who dresses in a plush way only buys the finest,
most expensive clothing. Plush living is lavish living.

* lore 								   :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 10:06]

Lore is a body of knowledge or tradition that is passed down among
members of a culture, usually orally. It's the lore in "folklore," and
responsible for spreading the word on mythical figures like Santa
Claus, Paul Bunyan, and even Uncle Sam.

Most lore begins as an oral tradition, passed on by word of mouth, and
only later takes on a written form. We tend to think of lore as
something centuries-old, as in the British "Arthurian lore"
surrounding the doings of the mythical King Arthur and his
court. However, newer lore — such as baseball lore — is constantly
springing up. Humans need and love their lore.

The Human Performance Lab occupies a plush office complex on the
outskirts of Tallahassee. The bookshelves that line the walls overflow
with an eclectic catalog of titles that have been relevant to Ericsson’s
research: The Musical Temperament, Surgery of the Foot, How to Be a Star
at Work, Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy, Lore of Running, The
Specialist Chick Sexer.

* stroll							   :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 16:27]

As a noun, a stroll is a leisurely walk. After a heavy meal, you may
want to go out for a stroll to help you work off some of the
calories. You also will take a stroll on your day off and the weather
is nice.

The word stroll originally came to English through the German word
strollen, which means to wander aimlessly. The word stroll can also be
used as a verb meaning to take a leisurely walk in which you do some
wandering. You may enjoy a stroll through the park, along the beach,
or down the city streets — take your time.

* plague							   :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 16:31]

When the homeowner described her ant problem as a plague, the
exterminator thought she was being a bit melodramatic. After all, a
few bugs aren't exactly a huge calamity.

Centuries ago, if you had admitted to a friend that you had the
plague, that friend would have hightailed it in the other
direction. In the Middle Ages, the plague was a horribly contagious
illness that spread like wildfire through Europe, killing millions of
people. Thanks to the introduction of better hygiene and antibiotics,
plague doesn't describe a killer disease as often these days. Instead,
it commonly overstates an annoyance, like an apartment dweller
claiming his building is plagued by cockroaches.

My problem is that I have been persecuted by an integer. For seven years
this number has followed me around, has intruded in my most private data,
and has assaulted me from the pages of our most public journals. This
number assumes a variety of disguises, being sometimes a little larger
and sometimes a little smaller than usual, but never changing so much as
to be unrecognizable. The persistence with which this number plagues me
is far more than a random accident. There is, to quote a famous senator,
a design behind it, some pattern governing its appearances. Either there
really is something unusual about the number or else I am suffering from
delusions of persecution.
* delusions :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 16:34]

A delusion is a belief that has no evidence in fact — a complete
illusion. The cook at the hot dog stand who thinks he is the best chef
in the world? That opinion is definitely a delusion.

The noun delusion is often used in the phrase delusions of grandeur,
which expresses the belief that unattainable goals are well within
reach, like a terrible actress's delusions of grandeur that she won't
just land her first role in a movie, it also will make her an Academy
Award winner. Delusions like that can be amusing for onlookers, but
other kinds of delusions are not, like those suffered by the mentally
ill. Their delusions can remove them from reality, making it hard to
function.

* savvy :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 16:48]

You are known as someone with a lot of business savvy, but only
because you've managed to keep your staggering debts a secret. Which
is actually pretty savvy. Someone who is savvy is shrewd and
perceptive.

Most English words stem directly from other European languages, like
French and Latin.  Not savvy.  It comes from the West Indies, a twist
on the French savez vous? — “Do you know?”  Savvy was first recorded
in its adjective form in 1905. Synonyms for the noun form include
acumen, discernment, grasp, perception, and sharpness.

Our working memories serve a critical role as a filter between our
perception of the world and our long-term memory of it. If every
sensation or thought was immediately filed away in the enormous database
that is our long-term memory, we’d be drowning, like S and Funes, in
irrelevant information. Most of the things that pass through our brain
don’t need to be remembered any longer than the moment or two we spend
perceiving them and, if necessary, reacting to them. In fact, dividing
memory between short-term and long-term stores is such a savvy way of
managing information that most computers are built around the same model.

* strewn :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 16:52]

When you strew something, you scatter it all over the place. At a
wedding, for example, the flower child's job is to strew the path with
petals.

One of the scariest parts of "The Wizard of Oz" is when the winged
monkeys pounce on the Scarecrow and strew his insides all over the
forest floor. It's a tricky word, because it sounds the same in the
present as it does in the past. The monkeys strew the straw then and
might strew it now: in any case, the straw will be strewn all
over. After the clambake, the beach was strewn with empty shells and
beer bottles. After strewing all that stuff, they forgot to clean up.

My own memory test did not occur in front of the Human Performance Lab’s
floor-to-ceiling projection screen. There were no guns holstered to my
belt, no eye-tracking devices attached to my head. My humble contribution
to human knowledge was extracted in Room 218 of the FSU psychology
department, a small windowless office with a stained carpet and old IQ
tests strewn across the floor. Ungenerously, it might be described as a
storage closet.

* staggering :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 17:15]

A staggering amount is an astonishing, astounding, stupefying
amount. Anything staggering blows your mind.

If you know that stagger means to stumble around uncertainly, then
you're close to the meaning of staggering: this is a word for things
that are so hard to believe you might fall down when you hear them. If
the President gets shot, that's staggering news. If there's a major
earthquake, that's staggering. Alien life contacting the Earth would
be extremely staggering. Anything that knocks your socks off or makes
your mind reel is staggering.

You are known as someone with a lot of business savvy, but only
because you've managed to keep your staggering debts a secret. Which
is actually pretty savvy. Someone who is savvy is shrewd and
perceptive.

* calamity :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-22 Fri 17:22]

Use the word calamity to describe an event that causes great harm and
misery, or a general state of distress or misery: the calamity of war.

Near synonyms are catastrophe and disaster. The noun calamity is from
Middle English calamytey, from Latin calamitas, a word which might be
related to Latin clades "destruction." Calamity Jane was the nickname
of a 19th-century woman living on the U.S. frontier. She claimed to
have some very exciting adventures.

* twitch :MoonWalk:

noun
 1. a short, sudden jerking or convulsive movement.
    "his mouth gave a slight twitch"

* rigorous :MoonWalk:
[2016-07-25 Mon 18:43]

If you are rigorous when you do something, you do it extremely
carefully and precisely. A rigorous inspection of your tax records has
revealed the government owes you money. Congratulations!

The Latin root for rigorous is rigor, meaning “stiffness.” This might
remind you or rigor mortis, the stiffening of a body after death, as
often seen on cop shows. This is a good, if creepy, way of remembering
the meaning of rigorous: rigorous people are stiff and unbending about
the standards of their work. This requires being alive, of course.

We made some efforts to write our tests in Chapter 2, Working with doctest,
according to this discipline, although we allowed ourselves some wiggle room
because we were focusing on writing a testable specification. In this
chapter, we're going to be more rigorous.
* niggle :Quora:
[2016-07-26 Tue 18:51]

To niggle means to argue over petty things, like battling over who
gets the front seat or bickering about who's turn it is to take out
the garbage.

To niggle is to squabble over something silly or even to persistently
nag or worry someone to death. Etymologists believe the verb niggle
could be from Scandinavian roots, but there's no point quibbling over
its unclear origin. All you need to know is that niggling is largely
annoying to all involved.

It was honestly a mistake the first time. He loved the peas and I told
him he couldn't have any more until after he finished the rest of his
meal. This obviously made him feel it was a restricted food like
cookies and chocolate which he also couldn't have until after his
meal. Before I knew it he started asking me whether he would get peas
if he ate all his food well. Instead of correcting him we just let it
be and now every time I give him a handful of peas he glows like I
handed him a basket of candy. I feel a slight niggle of guilt but then
I figure it can only be good for him.

* cynical :Quora:
[2016-07-26 Tue 18:59]

If you think public officials are nothing but a bunch of greedy
buffoons, you have a cynical attitude about politics.

A cynical person has a bleak outlook about others, always imagining
that people are ruled by their worst instincts. H.L. Mencken was
famous for saying cynical things like, "Nobody ever went broke
underestimating the intelligence of the American public." The original
Cynics were ancient Greek philosophers who never had a good word to
say about anyone. The Greek word kynikos actually means "canine,"
maybe because all of that sneering seemed a little dog-like.

At $75k, I also became slightly cynical due to the many "$30,000
millionaires" in Dallas who make $30-60k yet drive very nice (leased)
cars and rack up huge credit card bills (which often get paid off by
wealthy parents). It used to bother me that people would assume I was
just one of the same when I wanted people to know I was self-made.
* panache :Quora:
[2016-07-26 Tue 19:07]

To have panache is to have a stylish flair. You might wear your giant
polka-dotted scarf with great panache.

Panache comes from the Latin word pinnaculum, which means “small wing”
or “tuft of feathers.” When you decorate yourself with a flourish,
have an elegant appearance, or do something with style, you are said
to have panache. You might wear your beret with new-found
panache. Your aunt Milly may throw a party with unmatched panache. Or
you brother's ability to turn a phrase may show an uncommon panache.

Reputations, prestige, panache do not get you a free pass or any
breaks. They just buy you some time. If that.

* tangled :LPT:
[2016-07-27 Wed 10:21]

Tangled is an adjective that describes a confused mass. You're likely
to hear tangled used most often when referring to hair. If it's
tangled, you can't brush or comb through it.

Other than discussing hair, tangled can be used to refer to anything
that's jumbled up and confused. Like that tangled pile of wires behind
your television and computer that you keep tripping over. Tangled can
also mean something highly complicated or intricate, like the
relationships between ex-wives, ex-husbands and stepchildren in a
family. The word tangled is most famous for being included in a
well-known literary quote from Sir Walter Scott's poem, "Marmion" —
"Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to deceive."

Answer: There are three units that exist in the preceding code and that
  are as follows: __init__, method1, and method2. __init__ is a method,
  just as method1 and method2. The fact that it's a constructor means
  that it's all tangled up with the other units, but it's still a method
  containing code and a possible location for bugs, and so we cannot
  afford to treat this as anything other than a unit.
* rigamarole :LPT:
[2016-07-27 Wed 10:26]

Rigamarole is a messy, complicated process that takes longer than it
should. The rigamarole involved in getting your driver's license might
make it tempting to just keep riding your bike.

The word rigamarole, which is also spelled rigmarole, is a great way
to describe bureaucratic procedures like paying taxes or registering
for college classes, or lengthy tasks like helping a small child put
on boots, mittens, a coat, and a hat before leaving the house on a
snowy day. You can also use it to mean "a long, rambling story:" "He
went into the rigamarole of how he'd pulled himself up by his boot
straps."

The smaller the units are, the more useful the tests tend to be because
they narrow down the location and nature of bugs more quickly. For
example, if you choose to treat the Testable class as a unit, tests of
the class will fail if there is a mistake in any of the methods. This
tells you that there's a mistake in Testable, but not that it's in
method2, or wherever it actually is. On the other hand, there is a
certain amount of rigamarole involved in treating method4 and its like as
units, to such an extent that the next chapter of the book is dedicated
to dealing with such situations. Even so, I recommend using methods and
functions as units most of the time because it pays off in the long run.
* bogged :LPT:
[2016-07-27 Wed 10:28]

You'd be pretty soggy by morning if you accidentally set your tent up
in a bog. A bog is a swampy kind of ground made up mostly of
decomposing plants and mosses.

Nothing can be built on a bog because the ground is so spongy and
damp, and no crops can be grown there. The dried soil from a bog can,
however, be dried and burned for fuel. A figurative bog is anything
that you tend to get stuck in, like a bog of health problems. Things
can also "bog you down", or slow you down literally or figuratively,
like when your homework bogs you down so you can't enjoy the weekend.

We're going to walk through the development of one class, treating it as
a complete programming project and integrating unit testing at each step
of the process. For something as small as a single standalone class, this
may seem silly, but it illustrates the practices that keep larger
projects from getting bogged down in a tangle of bugs.

    "With the doors and windows sealed, the air should be purified by sprinkling perfumes and scents and by burning aromatic woods such as laurel , myrtle, rosemary and cypress."
 2. the foliage of the bay tree woven into a wreath or crown and worn on the head as an emblem of victory or mark of honor in classical times.

* conceal :LPT:
[2016-07-27 Wed 12:14]

When you conceal something, you are keeping it from being discovered:
“To avoid another argument with his cousins, Jonathan worked hard to
conceal his disappointment at the outcome of the race.”

The verb conceal can be used to describe the hiding of feelings (as in
“to conceal anger”) or facts (as in “to conceal identity”). Conceal
also can be used to describe the act of hiding or covering an item to
prevent discovery. If you eat the last piece of chocolate cake, for
example, you may want to conceal the evidence by removing the
icing-stained plate from your room.

I'd wonder, how did my parents conceal the fact that I had an
identical twin? Then I'd realize, it wasn't really hard. Maybe they
sent out one for adoption directly from the hospital. Next question,
why? No good answers there.
* stray :Quora:

Little Red Riding Hood strayed from the path and ended up getting

paying attention to where you're going, and sometimes you get in
trouble.

Stray can be used as a verb or as a noun. Your attention may stray
when you're tired and listening to a very boring lecture. You may be
the kind of person who brings home strays, the dogs and cats that have
wandered away from their homes and are lost and hungry. When you're
organizing your sock drawer and you've got one sock without a mate,
you might find the stray sock left behind in the dryer.

Something daunting can scare you off. If you have a lot of studying to
do, it may seem like a daunting task. Good news is you can get through
it by working hard. Or weasel out of it by playing sick.

Often used in the phrases “daunting prospect” and “daunting task,”
daunting describes something that you are not looking forward to
doing. Having to fill out complicated tax forms every year is a
daunting task for many people. Once a daunting task is complete, you
no longer describe it as daunting, but instead can call it a job well
done, or at least another life experience survived.

Keeping track of multiple repositories may seem like a /daunting/
     prospect, but the fundamentals you learn in this chapter apply

Contentment is the state of being happy and satisfied. On Thanksgiving
when you think about all you are grateful for, hopefully you feel a
sense of contentment. If not, have another piece of pie and then
you’ll feel contentment.

Contentment isn’t an excited kind of happy, it’s more like a peaceful
ease of mind. It’s being satisfied with what you have, whatever that
is. You might feel a sense of contentment knowing you have a cup of
hot chocolate and a good movie to look forward to tonight. Or you
might experience contentment thinking about the vast estate you just
purchased in the Hamptons. Whatever is going on in your life, you’re
pleased about it.

To facilitate means to make something easier. If your best friend is

Facilitate comes from the Latin facilis, for easy. It means to make
something easier or more likely to happen. You facilitate growth or a

someone will be assigned to facilitate a discussion so people don't

* swaths :ProGit:
[2016-07-30 Sat 17:32]

A swath was originally the long narrow space created by a single swing
of a scythe in a field of grass or corn as the cutter moved through
it. Nowadays it is used more figuratively to mean any kind of path
someone makes.

The figurative use of swath has nonphysical senses as well, as in the
term "a significant swath of the population believes..." Or if someone
is trying to attract attention to themselves, or is making quite a
public stir, they might be said to be "cutting a swath through the
business world" or "cutting a swath on the dance floor." Hopefully,
neither of the latter involves using scythes.

The Open Source community using Git has also exploded. When I originally sat
down to write the book nearly five years ago (it took me a while to get the
first version out), I had just started working at a very little known company
developing a Git hosting website called GitHub. At the time of publishing
there were maybe a few thousand people using the site and just four of us
working on it. As I write this introduction, GitHub is announcing our 10
millionth hosted project, with nearly 5 million registered developer accounts
and over 230 employees. Love it or hate it, GitHub has heavily changed large
swaths of the Open Source community in a way that was barely conceivable when
I sat down to write the first edition.
* conceivable							     :ProGit:
[2016-07-30 Sat 17:33]

adjective
 1. мыслимый (conceivable, thinkable, cogitable)
 2. возможный (possible, feasible, eventual, potential, probable, conceivable)
 3. постижимый (comprehensible, conceivable, apprehensible, perceivable)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. capable of being imagined or grasped mentally.
    "a mass uprising was entirely conceivable"
 
If you see yellowish skies on a humid, spring evening in Kansas, it is
entirely conceivable that a tornado is in the making. That is to say,
it's imaginable or even possible, so make sure you take every
conceivable precaution.

If you conceive of something, you imagine or think of it. So, it makes
sense that the adjective conceivable describes things that can be
imagined or thought of. People often use the word conceivable in
extreme contexts. If you look everywhere for your homework but still
can't find it, you might declare, "I searched in every conceivable
location! My homework must have disappeared." In response, your
teacher might remark that disappearing homework is inconceivable, or
"impossible to imagine."

* scythe							     :ProGit:
[2016-07-30 Sat 17:36]

A scythe is a sharp, curved blade used for mowing or reaping. While
farmers use it to cut plants, the grim reaper uses it to, well, scare
you to death.

In Old English, scythe was spelled siðe. Since there is no longer an ð
in modern English, scythe became the accepted form of the word in the
early 15th century. It drew its sc- start from the Latin scissor,
meaning “carver, cutter.” Farmers use these tools to slice and trim
grass and other plant stalks. Napoleon Bonaparte once noted that
“Occupation is the scythe of time,” meaning that work mows down or
diminishes time.

посеять

verb
 1. давать выход (vent, wreak, exhale, uncork)
 2. давать волю (give way, let loose, uncurb, loose, unrein, wreak)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. cause (a large amount of damage or harm).
    "torrential rainstorms wreaked havoc yesterday"

To wreak is to cause something to happen, usually with a terrible
consequence. You can make mischief, cause problems, or inflict pain,
but to wreak damage suggests a deeper level of destruction.

Wreak stems from the Old English wrecan, meaning "to avenge." Its
current meaning, that of causing something to happen — usually with
dire consequences — came about in the 19th century. The word is a
transitive verb, often paired with the equally intense havoc, meaning
"devastation."

And that sort of negative feedback can wreak havoc on your psyche.

verb
 1. опустошать (devastate, ravage, waste, decimate, desolate, havoc)
 2. разрушать (destroy, ruin, break, break down, disrupt, havoc)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. widespread destruction.

verb
 1. lay waste to; devastate.
    "The lack of participants is associated to a large storm that havocked Latvia in January 2005 and uprooted and destroyed large forest areas."

Havoc is a noun that means devastation or total mayhem. Havoc often
wreaked by hurricanes, angry mobs, plundering Vikings, and wild
parties that get out of control.

If we trace havoc way back, we arrive at a crossroads. Some people
believe that the word comes from the Old French havot, meaning
“plundering, devastation,” while others argue that it was passed down
to us from the Latin habere, meaning “to have, possess.” Either way
you look at it, the meaning remains the same: widespread disorder or
destruction.

From the Old French couper, cope means “come to blows with." Coping
can imply struggle, but it’s usually met with success or at the very
least, not failure. Another word to describe the balancing act of a

In a Western, outlaws will lie in wait at the top of a ravine, or
narrow valley, until they see a traveler entering at the bottom. Then,
the outlaws will come pounding down the ravine's steep sides.

Ravines can be lonely and violent places averse to settlement as
nothing can be built along their steep sides. The word ravine itself
derives from the archaic rapin, which is a violent seizure of
property. During times of heavy rains and snow melt, a ravine may be
filled with violent, rushing water.

I had many close calls but there was one close call I will never
forget last 2011 when I was running downhill, slipped a step, and fell
off a ravine. I was rolling and tumbling for I cannot remember how
many times. I just felt roots and stones hitting my ribs, my legs, my

    "A post-mortem examination found she had died of multiple injuries but had pre-existing bruises on her body."

verb
 1. inflict an injury on (someone or something) causing discoloration of the skin.
    "a bruised knee"

If you're just learning to skateboard, you’ve probably got an ugly
bruise or two to show for it — those purple and yellow patches you get
on your skin where you’ve bumped and scraped. They probably hurt, too!

You can find bruises at the grocery store, too — those soft, mushy
spots on a peach or an apple — and if you drop a tomato, you're likely
to bruise it.  You can bruise your knee or bruise someone's feelings —

If you were caught in the pouring rain, missed your own birthday
party, and then got food poisoning, you wouldn't just feel bad. You'd
be miserable — which means exceptionally unhappy. Victor Hugo's novel,
Les Miserables ("The Miserable Ones"), is the story of people who live
a wretched life filled with death and unhappiness. You might want to

adjective
 1. побудительный (incentive, impellent, urging)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a thing that motivates or encourages one to do something.
    "there is no incentive for customers to conserve water"

If your mom wants you to mow the lawn but you don't feel like it, she

incentive is something that stimulates you to take action or work

This noun dates back to Middle English, from Late Latin incentivum,
from incentivus "stimulating." In Latin, incentivus meant "setting the
tune," from incinere "to sing." The related English verb is
incentivize. The less common verb incent was first used in the early
1980s, and has been criticized as business jargon.

extreme than just a celebration. You might rejoice after scoring the
winning goal in a championship game, or you might rejoice when you
receive an amazing gift on your birthday. You’ll often hear this word
in the phrase “let us rejoice,” especially in some religious settings.

Little Lamb, who made thee
Dost thou know who made thee,
Gave thee life, and bid thee feed
By the stream and o'er the mead;
Gave thee clothing of delight,
Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
Gave thee such a tender voice,
Making all the vales rejoice?
* bereaved :Quora:
[2016-08-05 Fri 09:44]

Bereaved is an adjective describing people in deep sorrow at the loss
of a loved one. For some, being bereaved helps them leave the sadness
or release themselves from it by experiencing it for awhile.

From the Old English berēafian, meaning "deprive of," bereaved
describes the loss you feel when someone you love dies. You are
suddenly deprived of the person's presence, and missing and mourning
leads to being bereaved. Losing a pet causes similar feelings, and you
can be bereaved when a person goes away but is still alive. Loss and
separation even in life are still reason to be bereaved over the
absence. If someone leaves and you miss them deeply, you may be
bereaved.

White as an angel is the English child,
But I am black, as if bereaved of light.

* slew :Quora:
[2016-08-05 Fri 20:44]

Of all the many nouns referring to a large group of things, one of the
most fun is slew, as in "I saw a whole slew of birds in the tree by
the river."

American English is constantly evolving, its richness coming from the
many languages feeding into it. The noun slew, for instance, is from
the Irish Gaelic sluagh, meaning "multitude." As an unrelated verb,
it's the past tense of slay.

I don't think it's that impressive to be able to use a slew of
languages.
* mended :Quora:
[2016-08-06 Sat 16:02]

When you mend something, you fix it or make it better. If you can mend
your broken lamp, then it will shine again. If not you'll have to sit
in the dark.

The word mend was originally used as a religious term, meaning to free
a person from sin, usually through repentance and good deeds. Mend has
come to refer to fixing something that is broken. A mechanic might
mend a broken car, or a seamstress might mend a torn dress. The word
also frequently relates health and healing. Someone recovering from a
long bout of the flu is said to be "on the mend." But as the song
goes, "How can you mend a broken heart?"

* torn 								      :Quora:
[2016-08-06 Sat 16:25]

порванный

adjective
 1. порванный (torn)
 2. разорванный (torn, disrupted, lacerated, in rags, disrupt)
 3. разодранный (torn)
 4. продранный (torn)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. pull or rip (something) apart or to pieces with force.
    "I tore up the letter"
 2. move very quickly, typically in a reckless or excited manner.
    "she tore along the footpath on her bike"
 3. be in a state of uncertainty between two conflicting options or parties.
    "he was torn between his duty and his better instincts"
 4. (of the eye) produce tears.
    "the freezing wind made her eyes tear"

* parlance :Quora:
[2016-08-06 Sat 17:43]

The noun parlance means the manner of speaking and using words. Your
15-year-old will tell you that you are definitely not fluent in the
parlance of teenagers, no matter how cool you think you are.

Parlance comes from the French word parler, meaning "to speak." The
noun is often used to refer to the jargon or slang a certain group or
industry uses. If you work in the sciences, you'll be familiar with
the parlance of scientists and be familiar with such jargon as
"goodness of fit" and "iff", which means "if and only if". But if you
are not a scientist, you may stumble when you first come across such
terms.

A cherry-pick,
in Git parlance, is an operation which moves a specific glob of changed code
from one branch of the VCS to another.
* diverge 							      :Quora:
[2016-08-06 Sat 17:44]

When two roads diverge, they split and go in different directions. If
your opinion diverges from mine, we do not agree. To diverge means to
move apart or be separate.

The poet, Robert Frost, wrote: "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -/
I took the one less traveled by / And that has made all the
difference." The word diverge in the poem carries both the meaning of
separating and of being apart from the main. As a poet, it was Frost's
job to use words properly. Here he does not diverge from this role.

* brittle 							      :Quora:
[2016-08-06 Sat 18:32]

Something brittle is easily broken. Do you have brittle bones? Then no
football or rugby for you.

Besides meaning easily fractured and emotionally cold, brittle is also
a type of candy made of cooled sugar. To make peanut brittle, bake the
ingredients on a cookie sheet then let the brittle cool into sheets
which you break into pieces (and then eat — wreaking havoc with your
braces). It's ok to use the adjective brittle freely to describe lots
of things that will break easily — such as a heart, a theory, or a
poorly equipped army.
* mutt :Quora:
[2016-08-09 Tue 10:37]

A mutt is any dog that's a combination of different breeds, rather
than one identifiable breed. Your beloved mutt might be as big as a
Golden Retriever but with short, Corgi-like legs.

Most dogs are mutts, and many of their owners are fine with the word
mutt, despite the word's original implication of "inferior, mixed
breed dog." Dogs called crossbreeds are deliberately bred to combine
characteristics of two or more recognized breeds, while mutts — also
known as mongrels — are the result of accidental mixing of breeds. In
the late 1800s, mutt was a derogatory term meaning either "stupid
person" or "stupid dog."

She was a rescue, a mutt, maybe part bull terrier; absolutely
beautiful, lion colored, with a strong white chest and white snout.
* snout :Quora:
[2016-08-09 Tue 10:38]

An animal's long, protruding nose is often called a snout. The tricky
part, though, is that not all long animal noses are called snouts.

An elephant has a very long nose, but we don't call it a snout, we
call it a trunk. A horse's nose is rarely referred to as a snout,
because it's really their whole face that's long. Birds have beaks.
Most dogs have a snout, except for pugs and boxers and other dogs with
smashed-in faces. Bears have snouts, as do rats. Do yourself a favor,
though, and never tell a person that they have a snout, no matter how
large their nose is. Believe it or not, snout may actually be a cousin
of the word snot: that should help you remember it!

* flawed :Quora:
[2016-08-09 Tue 10:42]

Things that are flawed are less than perfect. A flawed dinner plate
might have a small chip in it, and a flawed English paper includes at
least one mistake.

Flawed objects have some kind of imperfection — a dent or a blemish.
No one's perfect, so everyone is flawed in some way, but when this
word describes a person it often means "weak in character."A
Shakespearian flawed hero has some flaw or foible that will ultimately
be his undoing: in other words, a "fatal flaw." Flawed comes from
flaw, originally "a flake of snow," later "a splinter," and finally
"an imperfection."

It's not that it isn't
true: it's that we are so incredibly flawed.
* intestines :Quora:
[2016-08-09 Tue 10:48]

When you eat food, it first passes into your stomach, and then into
your intestine. Fun fact: your large intestine is about five feet
long. Makes you wonder why they don't call it your "long intestine"
instead.

The human intestine is split into two sections: the small intestine
and the large intestine. Your intestine's job is to continue breaking
down the food you've eaten and absorb nutrients into your bloodstream.
Intestine comes from the Latin word intestinum, "gut" or "bowels,"
which is the neuter form of the adjective intestinus, "inward" or
"internal."

This will keep your body efficient by
not having to maintain everything inside your intestines at a certain
body temperature required to survive.
* exceedingly :Quora:
[2016-08-09 Tue 10:48]

Use the adverb exceedingly to mean "very." You might brag, for
example, that you did exceedingly well on the big math test last week.

Exceedingly means "to a very large degree," so it's best to save it
for things that really need to be emphasized. You might be exceedingly
angry at your little sister after she borrowed your favorite sweater
and spilled ketchup on it, or exceedingly happy to have gotten into
your first choice college. Exceedingly has a Latin root, excedere,
"depart, go beyond, be in excess, or surpass."

- Liquid water is exceedingly difficult to come by in extreme cold

* beverage :Quora:
[2016-08-09 Tue 10:50]

A beverage is any type of drink. It's something you might offer a
guest in your house; it's also the favorite moniker of companies that
manufacture both soda and juice — they call themselves beverage
companies.

One of the most popular beverages in history is Coca-Cola, developed
in 1886. Initially, Coke was called a brain tonic for intellectuals.
Ingredients of the original recipe included coca leaves and cola nuts,
and until 1909 contained small amounts of cocaine. Today, the Coca
Cola company markets hundreds of beverages including soft drinks,
juices, and sports drinks.

* mischievous :MoonWalk:
[2016-08-09 Tue 17:33]

/ˈmɪs tʃə vəs/ 

adjective
 1. озорной (mischievous, naughty, wicked, sly, gamine, prankish)
 2. вредный (harmful, adverse, detrimental, pernicious, bad, mischievous)
 3. непослушный (naughty, disobedient, unruly, rebellious, recalcitrant, mischievous)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. (of a person, animal, or their behavior) causing or showing a fondness for causing trouble in a playful way.
    "two mischievous kittens had decorated the bed with shredded newspaper"

If you’re the one making prank phone calls at 3 am and you can’t
resist short-sheeting your camp counselor’s bunk, you're mischievous.
If your dog likes to decorate your house with streamers of toilet
paper, he's mischievous, too.

You can be mischievous in harmless, playful ways, or you might also
use the word mischievous to describe behavior that's more than just a
little naughty. If you post online some embarrassing photos of an
acquaintance, your more generous friends might describe your behavior
as mischievous, although others might accuse you of being downright
mean. Keep in mind that the word has only three syllables:
MIS-chuh-vuhs.

* reputedly :MoonWalk:
[2016-08-09 Tue 17:37]

по общему мнению

adverb
 1. по общему мнению (reputedly, supposedly)

DEFINITION

adverb
 1. according to what people say or believe; supposedly.
    "he reputedly gained a £1.2-million settlement at the end of their marriage"

From that simple observation,
Simonides reputedly invented a technique that would form the basis of
what came to be known as the art of memory.
* intervening :MoonWalk:
[2016-08-09 Tue 17:40]

/ˌɪn tərˈvin/

verb
 1. вмешиваться (interfere, intervene, meddle, tamper, step in, interrupt)
 2. помешать (intervene, intercept, hopple)
 3. вступаться (intercede, intervene)
 4. вступать в дело (intervene, embark)
 5. происходить (occur, happen, take place, be, come, originate)
 6. лежать между (intervene)
 7. являться помехой (intervene)
 8. находиться между (intervene)
 9. иметь место (take place, occur, come off, pass, intervene)
10. находиться (be, locate, reside, lie, exist, be found)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. come between so as to prevent or alter a result or course of events.
    "he acted outside his authority when he intervened in the dispute"
 2. occur in time between events.
    "to occupy the intervening months, she took a job in a hospital"

Intervening means happening between other things. Middle school is an
intervening phase between elementary school and high school.

Intervening is an adjective that comes from the Latin intervenire,
from inter-, meaning “between,” and venire, meaning “come.” That which
is intervening comes between. The intervening period of your life
between high school and college could involve a stint in the circus.
You never know.

Though the intervening two thousand years have seen quite a few
innovations in the art of memory, the basic techniques have remained
fundamentally unchanged from those described in the Ad Herennium.
* oeuvre :MoonWalk:
[2016-08-09 Tue 17:42]

/ˈœ vrə/

The oeuvre of a writer or artist refers to all their work combined.
Writing one book isn't much of an oeuvre, but writing ten could be.

This is a French word often used by critics — people who comment on
the work of writers, painters, musicians, and other artists. An oeuvre
is the total output of an artist. Just like critics give a thumbs up
or down to a single movie, they give opinions on oeuvres as well. You
could say a band's current album stinks, but since they've made great
music for 10 years, they still have an impressive oeuvre.

Before I sampled Tony Buzan’s expansive oeuvre (he’s authored or
coauthored over 120 books) or any of the self-help books put out by the
top mental athletes, Ed wanted me to start my investigation with the
classics.

* literate :HRB:
[2016-08-10 Wed 13:16]

If you're literate you can read and write, and since you're reading
this, that's what you are.

Literate can also mean more than just being able to read and write,
but being really fluent in a field. If you're "computer literate," you
know how to use a computer with ease. If you're up on the latest
advances in science, you're "scientifically literate." If people
describe you admiringly as literate, they think you're widely read and
know a lot about lots of different fields. The opposite of literate is
illiterate.

Today many
more of the young men and women who complete high school enter and
complete four years of college; a much larger proportion of the
population has become literate in spite of or even because of the
popularity of radio and television.
* desideratum :HRB:
[2016-08-10 Wed 13:19]

/dɪˌsɪd əˈreɪ təm/

noun
 1. что-либо недостающее (desideratum)
 2. что-либо желаемое (desideratum)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. something that is needed or wanted.
    "integrity was a desideratum"

A desideratum is something you desire or want. It's a fancy word for a
must-have.

This official-sounding Latin word means something very common:
anything you want or need. A new book could be a desideratum. A
chocolate cake could be a desideratum. More commonly, a desideratum is
something that is truly needed, like food or shelter. For many people,
a happy marriage is a desideratum. For a politician, getting elected
is a desideratum. You can almost see the word desire in desideratum,
and that should help you remember it’s an object of desire.

One
constant is that, to achieve all the purposes of reading, the desideratum
must be the ability to read different things at
different-appropriate-speeds, not everything at the greatest possible
speed.
* ineptitude :HRB:
[2016-08-10 Wed 13:23]

Ineptitude is a lack of skill, ability, or competence. A doctor would
prove his ineptitude at practicing medicine if he mistakenly removed a
patient's spleen instead of his kidney.

Ineptitude and incompetence are synonyms to describe people who have
absolutely no idea what they're doing. It's definitely not a quality
you'd want in a pilot, who might prove his ineptitude by sending a
plane full of passengers hurtling to the ground. Ineptitude also isn't
a good quality to have in fields like medicine, where even one
careless mistake could be life-threatening.

A great many pupils do poorly in high school because
of sheer ineptitude in getting meaning from the printed page.
* compel 								:HRB:
[2016-08-10 Wed 13:41]

вынуждать

verb
 1. принуждать (compel, force, coerce, enforce, oblige, constrain)
 2. заставлять (force, make, cause, get, compel, lead)
 3. вынуждать (force, compel, necessitate, drive, constrain, enforce)
 4. добиваться (achieve, seek, get, obtain, press for, compel)
 5. подчинять (subordinate, submit, subject, subdue, subjugate, compel)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. force or oblige (someone) to do something.
    "a sense of duty compelled Harry to answer her questions"

Compel means to force or drive someone to do something. Even if you
don't like toast, when you visit the toast-eating natives of
Shrintakook Island, you'll be compelled to eat it, or they will not
trust you.

You don't want to be compelled to go to a classical music concert if
you'd rather listen to rap. School officials might be upset if a
winter storm compels them to cancel classes, but you'd be okay with
that. A compelling mystery forces you to pay attention because you
want to find out "whodunit."

Adler spends a good deal of this first section explaining why he was 
compelled to write this book.

* deem :Quora:
[2016-08-11 Thu 08:12]

verb
 1. считать (think, consider, count, feel, find, deem)
 2. полагать (believe, think, suppose, guess, consider, deem)
 3. думать (think, believe, expect, suppose, imagine, deem)
 4. размышлять (reflect, meditate, think, ponder, contemplate, deem)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. regard or consider in a specified way.
    "the event was deemed a great success"

To deem is a verb that means to view as or judge. Your parents or boss
may deem something necessary that you don't, like coming home by
midnight or working late.

Deem comes from the Old English word, deman — meaning "act as a
judge." If you deem something, you essentially become the judge of
whether it has a characteristic. For example, if you deem your little
sister's jokes to be too ridiculous to listen to, you will probably
just walk away.

Because It seems at times that the world is made for extroverts only,
introverts will deem it fit to conform to the extrovert model, as a
result of which they become pseudo-extroverts and bitter introverts.
* albeit :Quora:

 2. тем не менее (nevertheless, however, though, but, notwithstanding, albeit)
 3. даже хотя (albeit)

DEFINITION

conjunction
 1. although.
    "he was making progress, albeit rather slowly"
хотя

conjunction
 1. хотя (although, though, albeit, if, as, notwithstanding)
 2. тем не менее (nevertheless, however, though, but, notwithstanding, albeit)

    "he was making progress, albeit rather slowly"


This style of communications is becoming increasingly overrated, due
to a large number of introverts, crawling out out of their cocoons and
demanding social balance in their quiet albeit firm voices.
* dubious :Quora:
[2016-08-11 Thu 08:23]

Choose the adjective dubious for something you have doubts about or
you suspect is not true. That bridge you just "bought" might be of
dubious value.

Dubious stems from Latin dubiosus "doubtful" or "uncertain" and
contains the Latin root duo in this case meaning "of two minds." This
is apparent in that dubious generally describes something that appears
one way but is truly another. A dubious claim is probably not true,
whereas a dubious website or character is of questionable quality.
Dubious can also be synonymous with doubtful when referring to a
person as in "she was dubious about the idea."

3 Women cannot legally be paid less than men 
4 You can information anywhere through the Internet but unless you pay
  for it or go to a library the quality and depth can be dubious.
* vain :Quora:
[2016-08-11 Thu 15:53]

If you spend all day admiring yourself in reflective surfaces —
mirrors, pools of water, the backs of spoons — people may think you
are conceited or vain.

If, to your horror, you have searched everywhere for a reflective
surface but can't find one, you have made a fruitless or vain search
for a mirror. Vain is from Latin vanus "empty," and in English it
originally meant "lacking value or effect, futile"; we still say "a
vain attempt" using that sense, and the phrase "in vain" means
"without success." Normally, though, vain means "conceited, too proud
of oneself." Carly Simon's line "You're so vain, you probably think
this song is about you" is an excellent illustration of this use.

He was,
according to some, vain about his hair.

* slay :Quora:
[2016-08-12 Fri 08:37]

Slay means to kill in a violent way. It has a mythic quality. You
might slay the red knight. You might slay the dragon. You might slay
the demon. But you probably wouldn't slay an annoying mosquito.

Slay is an old word associated with knights and dragons. Like many old
words it has some funky forms. When you killed someone or something in
the past you say slew, as in "St. George slew the dragon." When you've
already done it, you say you have slain.

As an unrelated verb,
it's the past tense of slay.




* cumbersome :Quora:
[2016-08-12 Fri 11:01]

громоздкий

adjective
 1. громоздкий (bulky, cumbersome, unwieldy, ponderous, cumbrous)
 2. обременительный (burdensome, onerous, cumbersome, heavy, vexatious, cumbrous)
 3. нескладной (cumbersome, cumbrous)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. large or heavy and therefore difficult to carry or use; unwieldy.
    "cumbersome diving suits"

You have to wrestle a bit with the longish word cumbersome; it's
cumbersome, or kind of long and clumsy, to tumble out in a sentence.
It's hard to use it gracefully.

A "cumber" is something that slows you down, and though the words
aren't related, "lumber" includes big pieces of heavy wood, which
might slow down the person carrying them. Moving lumber is cumbersome,
because it's a heavy and awkward job. Getting your laundry down the
stairs or putting a Rottweiler in the bathtub can be cumbersome too.

- If it is cumbersome to use the external interface to set up the exact state
  that we want, or there is no interface method that retrieves the specific value

* tradeoff 							      :Quora:
[2016-08-12 Fri 11:06]

компромисс

noun
 1. компромисс (compromise, trade-off, accommodation, composition, give-and-take)
 2. взаимные уступки (give-and-take, trade-off)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a balance achieved between two desirable but incompatible features; a compromise.
    "a trade-off between objectivity and relevance"


For the second and third cases, the important point is to understand that there
is a tradeoff between convenience, test readability, and brittleness.

* exert 							      :Quora:
[2016-08-12 Fri 17:17]

verb
 1. вызывать (call, cause, induce, call forth, summon, produce)
 2. влиять (influence, affect, act, manipulate, exert, weigh)
 3. прилагать усилия (make efforts, endeavor, strive, exert, labor, take pains)
 4. оказывать давление (pressurize, exert, enforce, lean on, crowd, screw)
 5. напрягать силы (exert, extend)
 6. вызывать напряжение (exert)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. apply or bring to bear (a force, influence, or quality).
    "the moon exerts a force on the Earth"
 2. make a physical or mental effort.
    "he needs to exert himself to try to find an answer"

Exert basically means to put forth effort to do something. For
example, when you exert yourself in a workout, you can really feel the
burn in your muscles.

The Latin verb exserere — with its derivative form exsertus, which is
the source of our word — means to "put forth." That's where exert gets
its meaning of physical force — consider that when you try hard at
something, you put forth effort to do it, you push yourself. But exert
can refer to other ways you "push": you exert your influence to
convince others to think your way; when one nation exerts its power on
another; and gravity exerts its force on us, holding us down on earth.

One reader is better than another in proportion as he is capable of a 
greater range of activity in reading and exerts more effort.

* noteworthy :Quora:
[2016-08-12 Fri 17:24]

If you keep a journal, you probably write the day's most noteworthy
events in it, or the most remarkable things that happen to you.

Something is described as noteworthy when it's worth taking interest
in it. Your teacher's enormous new beehive hairdo might be noteworthy
to you, while her insight into the history of your town might be less
noteworthy. The adjective noteworthy is a compound word made from note
plus worthy; in other words, if something's worthy of making a note
about it, it's noteworthy.

It is noteworthy that the pitcher and catcher are successful only to the extent that they
cooperate.
* converge :Quora:
[2016-08-12 Fri 17:25]

Use the verb converge to describe something that comes together at a
common point: “Thousands of Elvis fans plan to converge on the small
Arkansas town where unconfirmed sightings of the deceased superstar
eating at a local barbeque restaurant had been widely reported.”

Two roads, a roomful of politicians, or a group of rabid fans — when
things come together from different points they converge. Converge
traces back to the Latin word vergere, meaning “to bend or to turn."
The prefix con- means "with," a good way to remember that things that
converge come together. Don't confuse it with diverge, which means the
opposite: "move away," because the prefix “dis-” means “apart.”

The
writer's skill and the reader's skill converge upon a common end.
* entail :Quora:
[2016-08-12 Fri 17:27]

влечь за собой

verb
 1. влечь за собой (entail, involve, bring, carry, spell)
 2. вызывать (call, cause, induce, call forth, summon, produce)
 3. навлекать (bring on, draw, call down, court, draw down, entail)

noun
 1. майорат (entail)
 2. майоратное наследование (entail)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. involve (something) as a necessary or inevitable part or consequence.
    "a situation that entails considerable risks"
 2. settle the inheritance of (property) over a number of generations so that ownership remains within a particular group, usually one family.
    "her father's estate was entailed on a cousin"

noun
 1. a settlement of the inheritance of property over a number of generations so that it remains within a family or other group.
    "The greater aristocracy built up their estates, often in several counties, and protected them from the follies of spendthrift heirs by the entail or strict settlement."

Entail means what something involves. "The job entailed us standing in
the snow for hours dressed as giant, human hot dogs. It entailed far
too much humiliation to justify the $3.55 an hour we were paid."

The word entail is connected to the idea of preconditions. If you want
something, you better figure out what it entails. If we want to see
the movie at 9 o'clock, that will entail us waiting in the lobby
another hour. If we want to stay out of trouble with our moms, that
will entail us calling them and letting them know we're going to be
later than we said.

* exemplified :Quora:
[2016-08-12 Fri 17:31]

If you exemplify something, you're the perfect example of it. Say you
wear frilly shirts, knee-high boots, and black eye-make-up — you
exemplify the fashion world's obsession with pirates.

Exemplifying something can also mean make it clearer by offering an
illustration or an example. If you want to exemplify your argument
that, say, pirate gear is fashionable, you might want to show your
friends some pictures of celebrities wearing eye patches.

These two relations are exemplified by two different
experiences that you can have in reading your book.

 1. able to be understood; comprehensible.
    "this would make the system more intelligible to the general public"

Use the adjective intelligible to describe speech that is loud and
clear, like the intelligible words of your principal which, thanks to
a microphone, you were able to hear.

When your goal is to make your writing intelligible to anyone who
reads it, you chose clear, precise words and give details that tell
more about what you mean. You might also include examples.
Intelligible comes from the Latin word intelligibilis, "that can
understand or that which can be understood." The earlier meaning of
intelligible was "able to understand," which today is closer to the
meaning of intelligent.

If the book is completely intelligible to you from start to finish, 
then the author and you are as two minds in the same mold.

* nagging :Quora:
[2016-08-16 Tue 10:42]

Something that's nagging really bothers you — whether it's your
nagging older sister, reminding you to take out the trash, or a
nagging headache that lingers all day.

A nagging boss might continually complain about your work — you could
also describe her as "overcritical" or "faultfinding." When a physical
pain or discomfort is nagging, it's just as disagreeable, tormenting
or irritating you in an ongoing way, like a nagging pain in your lower
back. The source of nagging is nag, which originally meant "gnaw or
bite."

Without
tests, we always have a nagging doubt about whether we are about to break
something, and more often than not we decide to leave things alone.
* prerequisite :HBR:
[2016-08-16 Tue 11:54]

A prerequisite is a required prior condition. If something is required
in advance of something else, like if you have to take a beginning
Spanish class before signing up for Spanish II, then it’s a
prerequisite.

Add pre meaning "before" to require and you have something that's
"required before." (That's helpful when trying to spell prerequisite!)
Prerequisites to be able to graduate from college can seem like a
pain, but most schools offer some fun ways to fulfill them. For
example, you can often meet the physical education prerequisite by
taking bowling. Prerequisites aren't just for school: “The most
called-upon prerequisite of a friend is an accessible ear,” said Maya
Angelou, the American poet.

Being informed is prerequisite to being
enlightened.
* sophomores :HBR:
[2016-08-16 Tue 11:56]

A sophomore is in their second year, either in high school or college.
Once you became a sophomore, thinking you now knew everything, you
pitied the freshmen for their confusion over how to write college
papers.

Sophomore comes from the word sophism which means "a bad argument
that's clever but false," and that's sometimes how sophomores in
college act. They're not bright-eyed newcomers anymore, and think they
know a lot, but really they've much to learn. We also use the word for
other seconds: a band's second album is usually called their sophomore
album.

They are all sophomores.
* thoughtlessly :HBR:
[2016-08-16 Tue 12:06]

бездумно

adverb
 1. бездумно (thoughtlessly, light-headedly, light-mindedly, happy-go-lucky)
 2. беспечно (carelessly, lightly, jauntily, thoughtlessly, light-heartedly)

No one who has done this sort of reading would say it can be done
thoughtlessly.

* keenness :HBR:
[2016-08-16 Tue 12:11]

увлеченность

noun
 1. увлеченность (keenness)
 2. чуткость (sensitivity, keenness, delicacy, tenderness, advertence, advertency)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. the quality of being eager or enthusiastic; eagerness.
    "he has expressed his keenness to retain his job"


The art of reading, in short, includes all of the same skills
that are involved in the art of unaided discovery: keenness of observation,
readily available memory, range of imagination, and, of course, an intellect
trained in analysis and reflection.

* compartments :Quora:
[2016-08-16 Tue 18:47]

A compartment is a space within another space, like the glove
compartment in a car.

Compartments are spaces, but they're not spaces that stand on their
own. Rather, compartments are part of other spaces: they're
subdivisions. The trunk is a compartment of a car. A pocket is a
compartment of a suitcase. Closets are like compartments of rooms. One
of the most common compartments is a car's glove compartment, where
people throw all kinds of things. Anything that is divided into
smaller spaces has compartments. The ventricles are like compartments
of your heart.

Emacs "registers" are compartments where you can save text, rectangles,
positions, and other things for later use.

* eliminating :TDPD:
[2016-08-17 Wed 12:05]

уничтожение

noun
 1. уничтожение (destruction, annihilation, extermination, abolition, eradication, eliminating)

adjective
 1. уничтожающий (destroying, annihilating, scathing, destructive, crushing, eliminating)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. completely remove or get rid of (something).
    "a policy that would eliminate inflation"

As eliminate means "get rid of or do away with," it has become used to
refer to the end of a problem or even an entire species. We need to
eliminate sources of pollution in order to maintain a healthy world.

The original literal meaning of eliminate was "to thrust over the
threshold and out of doors, to kick out," but the 18th century saw the
word expand to mean "to exclude," and later to ridding the body of
waste. The verb then came to refer to getting rid of anything, such as
a problem or foul odor. The word took an ominous turn in the 20th
century, when we saw man-made pollution eliminate whole species, and
war, hate, and famine nearly eliminate whole groups of people.

The aim of refactoring is to make the
code better by eliminating some code smell.

* tempt 							       :TDPD:
[2016-08-17 Wed 12:51]

To tempt is to lure or entice. You might tempt your runaway dog back
inside with pieces of cheese.

The verb tempt often has negative implications: "Don't let those
bullies tempt you into picking on smaller kids!" When something tempts
you, it's often with the knowledge that it's not the best idea,
however attractive it might be. Tempt was originally a religious term,
meaning "to entice to evil or sin," while today it's more likely to be
a slice of cake that tempts us than the devil.

If you are tempted to write a
comment about what a piece of code does, then stop and think about
refactoring the code instead.

* rid :TDPD:
[2016-08-17 Wed 12:52]

избавиться

verb
 1. освобождать (rid, free, exempt, release, loose, liberate)
 2. избавлять (deliver, rid, save, rescue, redeem, release)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. make someone or something free of (a troublesome or unwanted person or thing).
    "we now have the greatest chance ever to rid the world of nuclear weapons"

In this example, the code is self-explanatory, so we can get
rid of the comment altogether.

* composure :Quora:
[2016-08-17 Wed 16:17]

хладнокровие

noun
 1. самообладание (composure, countenance, poise, temper, control, equanimity)
 2. хладнокровие (composure, cool, coolness, equanimity, cold blood, calmness)
 3. спокойствие (tranquility, calm, serenity, peace, calmness, composure)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. the state or feeling of being calm and in control of oneself.
    "she was struggling to regain her composure"

When you stay calm under pressure, you keep your composure. Keeping
your composure for a skinned knee? Easy. Keeping your composure during
an avalanche? Not so easy.

The word composure is from the related word composed, but don't think
of the word in the musical sense. In this case, composed means calm.
What's the difference between the two? Well, composed is an adjective,
so you simply are composed. Composure, on the other hand, is a noun,
so you can lose, keep, regain, or maintain your composure — your
ability to stay calm. If you lose your composure, you're freaking out.

Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the
highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual
clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions.

* armistice :Quora:
[2016-08-17 Wed 16:28]

/ˈɑr mə stɪs/

When two sides of a war need a break from killing each other, they
agree to an armistice, a temporary battle timeout. An armistice isn’t
permanent, but it’s usually a sign that both sides want to give peace
a chance.

War is exhausting, and sometimes you need an armistice to catch your
breath and figure out a more peaceful way to live. The word has two
Greek roots: arma which means “weapons,” and stitium which means
“stoppage.” When you’re ready to stop using your weapons, it’s time to
propose an armistice. Although the word looks like a mouthful, it’s
easy to pronounce if you remember that it’s an arm with two rhymes:
ARM-iss-tiss.

The third map shows the 1949 armistice lines which Jordan and the arab
nations specifically said were NOT final borders just because they
wanted to conquer all of Israel eventually.

* compile 							      :Quora:
[2016-08-17 Wed 16:36]

/kəmˈpaɪl/ 

When you compile something, like a recipe-book or a mix-tape, you put
it together using things that already exist (recipes, songs).

Poetry anthologies, greatest-hits albums, and world-record books are
all compilations, because they're made up of things that were
originally published or released somewhere else. If you want to skip
out on soccer practice one day, you might compile of list of excuses.

Ramanujan died at the age of 32, and in his short life compiled around
3900 results, almost all of which have been verified to be correct.

* saddle 							      :Quora:
[2016-08-18 Thu 11:31]

седло

noun
 1. седло (saddle, col, pigskin)
 2. суппорт (support, carriage, saddle, rest)
 3. седловина (saddle, col, saddleback)
 4. седелка (saddle, pad)
 5. подпятник (saddle)
 6. салазки (sled, slide, skid, carriage, sleigh, saddle)
 7. гнездо (nest, jack, socket, receptacle, housing, saddle)
 8. башмак (shoe, boot, chock, clog, saddle, scotch)
 9. антиклинальная складка (anticline, saddle)
10. подушка (pillow, cushion, pad, chock, saddle, bearer)
11. подкладка (lining, liner, pad, backing, pillow, saddle)
12. каретка суппорта (saddle)
13. союзка (saddle)

verb
 1. оседлать (saddle)
 2. седлать (saddle, saddle up)
 3. взваливать (charge, load, saddle)
 4. обременять (burden, encumber, charge, load, saddle, embarrass)
 5. садиться в седло (saddle, back)

adjective
 1. седельный (saddle)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a seat fastened on the back of a horse or other animal for riding, typically made of leather and raised at the front and rear.
    "Proper Tuareg riding saddles are placed in front of the camel's hump and you sit cross-legged with your bare feet resting on the camel's neck."
 2. something resembling a saddle in appearance, function, or position, in particular.
    "As you position the saddle , take care not to puncture the roofing felt, as this can cause leaks."
 3. a large cut of meat consisting of the two loins.
    "The rabbit was served as a tiny saddle , loin and liver."

verb
 1. put a saddle on (a horse).
    "he was in the stable saddling up his horse"

It is an ideal refactoring to apply when we see that a class has
become saddled with multiple responsibilities.


* intimidating :Quora:
[2016-08-18 Thu 12:27]

пугающим

verb
 1. запугивать (intimidate, bully, cow, browbeat, bluff, daunt)
 2. пугать (frighten, scare, panic, fright, intimidate, alarm)
 3. устрашать (intimidate, daunt, appal, appall)
 4. припугивать (intimidate, threaten)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. frighten or overawe (someone), especially in order to make them do what one wants.
    "he tries to intimidate his rivals"

Someone or something that causes fear is intimidating. Bullies are
intimidating.

Anyone or anything that is fearsome, daunting, or terrifying could be
called intimidating. Looking at a huge list of vocabulary words is
intimidating. Any difficult job can be intimidating. Lots of people
find public speaking intimidating. Climbing into the mouth of a
volcano and trying to take a photograph for National Geographic would
be extremely intimidating, because you could die, and if you don't,
what if your pictures aren't that good?

This chapter looks quite huge and intimidating, but once
we are comfortable with the techniques, it would take only about 30 to 60
minutes to perform all these refactorings.

* analyze 							      :Quora:
[2016-08-20 Sat 17:01]

Analyze means to study or examine something carefully in a methodical
way. If you analyze your child's report card, you may determine his
strength and weaknesses (and how many times he cut class).

This verb analyze comes from the noun analysis. The noun analysis was
in turn borrowed from Greek, from analyein, or "to dissolve." If you
go into analysis, it means that you will be examined and helped by a
mental health professional — who will analyze your particular problems
and help you find solutions.

* settler 							      :Quora:
[2016-08-21 Sun 01:05]

отстойник

noun
 1. поселенец (settler, homesteader, squatter, colonist, colonizer)
 2. отстойник (sump, settler, decanter, well, sinker)
 3. осадитель (precipitant, settler)
 4. сепаратор (separator, eliminator, settler)
 5. решающий довод (clincher, corker, finisher, finishing stroke, settler, sockdolager)
 6. решающий удар (settler, sockdolager)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a person who settles in an area, typically one with no or few previous inhabitants.
    "With only one exception settlers never had to come together and form a government."


A settler is a person who moves to a new place with the intention to
stay there. Colonial America was built by settlers who came mainly
from England.

* enthralling :Quora:
[2016-08-26 Fri 09:35]

увлекающий

adjective
 1. захватывающий (exciting, spectacular, breathtaking, thrilling, engrossing, enthralling)
 2. увлекательный (enthralling, absorbing, engrossing, intriguing)
 3. увлекающий (enthralling)
 4. порабощающий (enthralling)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. capturing and holding one's attention; fascinating.
    "an enthralling bestseller"

verb
 1. capture the fascinated attention of.
    "she had been so enthralled by the adventure that she had hardly noticed the cold"


Something enthralling is fascinating — you become completely absorbed
in it. An enthralling book is hard to put down, even when it's past
your bedtime.

When things captivate or grip you, they're enthralling. You can find
another person enthralling, or a well-made movie, a wonderful concert,
or an entrancing painting in a museum. Enthralling comes from the verb
enthrall, which means "capture one's attention," but had the original
meaning of "enslave." The word comes from the prefix en-, "make or put
in," and thrall, from the Old English þræl, "serf or slave."

If I could do it all again I would choose something that I was
passionately interested in to make my college experience more
enthralling.
* plausible :Quora:
[2016-08-26 Fri 09:58]

правдоподобный

adjective
 1. правдоподобный (plausible, probable, colorable, specious, verisimilar, colourable)
 2. вероятный (likely, probable, possible, credible, plausible, feasible)
 3. благовидный (plausible, specious, colorable, colourable, fair-faced)
 4. умеющий внушать доверие (plausible)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. (of an argument or statement) seeming reasonable or probable.
    "a plausible explanation"

If something is plausible, it's reasonable or believable. Things that
are plausible could easily happen. A woman becoming President is very
plausible. A giraffe becoming President is not.

Plausible things are not far-fetched at all. Things in fantasy stories
— such as wizards, dragons, and unicorns — are not plausible. On the
other hand, some things in science fiction stories might be plausible:
who knows where spaceships will eventually go? If something really
seems like it could happen, then it's plausible. One of the many
tricky parts of life is figuring out what's plausible and what's not.

A straight conversion of syntax is highly plausible, but I wouldn't
expect any program of complexity to actually work.
* quench :Quora:
[2016-08-26 Fri 10:05]

утолить

verb
 1. гасить (extinguish, put out, quench, douse, out, blow out)
 2. тушить (stew, extinguish, put out, braise, quench, out)
 3. закаливать (quench, harden, chill, draw)
 4. охлаждать пыл (quench)
 5. подавлять чувство (quench)
 6. быстро охлаждать (quench)
 7. удовлетворять (satisfy, meet, fulfill, respond, serve, quench)
 8. утолять жажду (quench, slake)
 9. заставить замолчать (silence, shut up, squelch, gag, compel silence, quench)
10. затыкать рот (gag, quench)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. satisfy (one's thirst) by drinking.
    "He no longer quenches his thirst by drinking sodas."
 2. extinguish (a fire).
    "firemen hauled on hoses in a desperate bid to quench the flames"

noun
 1. an act of quenching something very hot.
    "It should be noted, however, that this is not altogether advantageous, since the direction, as well as the magnitude, of the stress existing after the quench , is important in relation to cracking."

Quench means to put out, put an end to, or satisfy. If you're stranded
in the middle of the desert with nothing to drink, you're probably
dreaming of a nice big glass of ice water to quench your thirst.

Quench originally meant “extinguish fires.” That meaning still works
today, but we've expanded it to also apply to quenching the fiery
thirst of a summer marathon runner or quenching the hot flames of
passion. If you want to get deep about the word quench, consider what
Voltaire said: “Superstition sets the whole world in flames;
philosophy quenches them.”

* succeed :Quora:
[2016-08-26 Fri 11:56]

succeed

добиться успеха

verb
 1. преуспевать (succeed, do well, prosper, get on, thrive, flourish)
 2. иметь успех (be successful, succeed, take, come off, take on, score)
 3. следовать за (succeed, supervene, string along with)
 4. наследовать (inherit, derive, succeed, heir, come after)
 5. сменять (change, succeed, relieve, relay, spell)
 6. достигать цели (succeed, prevail)
 7. спориться (succeed)
 8. быть преемником (succeed, follow)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. achieve the desired aim or result.
    "a mission which could not possibly succeed"
 2. take over a throne, inheritance, office, or other position from.
    "he would succeed Hawke as prime minister"

When you succeed at something, you reach a goal or do really well. If
you practice speaking Arabic every day, you are likely to succeed at
becoming fluent in this language.

When you succeed, you achieve the result you hope for, but another way
to use succeed is to describe taking over a position. A prince who
will inherit his father's kingdom will succeed his father one day, and
a new high school principal can be said to succeed the old one. The
Latin root of succeed is succedere, come close after.

You will not succeed in life if you expect people to hold your hand
and give you all the answers.
* stubborn :Quora:
[2016-08-26 Fri 12:00]

упертый

adjective
 1. упрямый (stubborn, obstinate, opinionated, headstrong, dogged, willful)
 2. упорный (persistent, stubborn, hard, refractory, rebellious, obstinate)
 3. неподатливый (unyielding, stubborn, intractable, unaccommodating, unamenable, uncompliant)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. having or showing dogged determination not to change one's attitude or position on something, especially in spite of good arguments or reasons to do so.
    "he accused her of being a silly, stubborn old woman"

Use the adjective stubborn to describe someone who is not open to new
ideas or ways of doing things, like your uncle who refuses to listen
to any music made after 1990. Stubborn is the opposite of flexible.

The Middle English version of stubborn carried the sense of
“untamable, implacable,” and there’s still a hint of that in how it is
used today. A stubborn person holds on to a view or an attitude,
refusing to change — to the point of being unreasonable. Things can
also be stubborn, like a stain that no amount of scrubbing can clean
or a medical condition that, even with treatment, doesn't improve.

Some people might be naturally more stubborn and persevering, which
will probably come in handy.

* tying :Quora:
[2016-08-28 Sun 22:04]
завязывание

noun
 1. завязывание (tying, fastening)

adjective
 1. связывающий (contact, linking, tying, adhesive, conjunctive, communicant)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. attach or fasten (someone or something) with string or similar cord.
    "they tied Max to a chair"
 2. connect; link.
    "self-respect is closely tied up with the esteem in which one is held by one's peers"
 3. achieve the same score or ranking as another competitor or team.
    "he tied for second in the league"

I remember tying some yarn around a TV remote and pretending to plug
it into the computer, then gave it to my little brother and let him
think he was playing it.
* yarn 								      :Quora:
[2016-08-28 Sun 22:04]
пряжа

noun
 1. пряжа (yarn)
 2. нить (thread, yarn, filament, fiber, clue, funiculus)
 3. длинный рассказ (yarn)

verb
 1. рассказывать басни (fable, yarn)
 2. болтать (chat, talk, dangle, chatter, prattle, yarn)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. spun thread used for knitting, weaving, or sewing.
    "There was a guy in there showing a girl how to spin yarn using a spindle."
 2. a long or rambling story, especially one that is implausible.
    "The open fire is a focal point around which many yarns are spun and stories told."

verb
 1. tell a long or implausible story.
    "they were yarning about local legends and superstitions"

If you want to knit a hat, you're going to need yarn, the thick string
made of twisted threads that's used to make sweaters, scarves, socks
and other knitted things.

Yarn is made from fibers, and it comes in many colors. When you knit,
you weave yarn with needles and end up with a pot holder or a pair of
mittens. Another kind of yarn is a long story that's told out loud.
You might, in fact, tell your friend a yarn while you crochet an
afghan with yarn. The Old English root word, gearn, means "spun
fibers," but it comes from the Proto-Indo-European ghere, or
"intestine."

I remember tying some yarn around a TV remote and pretending to plug
it into the computer, then gave it to my little brother and let him
think he was playing it.

* disrupt :Quora:
[2016-08-30 Tue 13:41]

To disrupt is to interrupt or throw something into disorder. If you
don't turn your phone off before a play, it might ring and disrupt the
actors and the audience.

Disrupt goes back to the Latin root disrumpere, "to break apart." When
you disrupt, you break someone's concentration, break up a routine, or
break apart a system or order, as when bad weather disrupts the travel
plans of people in airports. Even if your headphones keep the music in
your ears only, singing out loud can disrupt those around you. A
larger interruption would be if a war were to erupt. That would
disrupt the peace of an entire region and its people.

Everyone has an inner giant inside that is begging to be unleashed and
disrupt this world.

* expelled :Quora:
[2016-08-31 Wed 19:19]

исключенный

adjective
 1. изгнанный (expelled, banished, outcast, evicted, excommunicated, proscribed)
 2. исключенный (excluded, expelled, eliminated, evicted, dropout)
 3. высланный (expelled, exiled, deportee)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. deprive (someone) of membership of or involvement in a school or other organization.
    "she was expelled from school"

Getting expelled from a school is a step beyond suspension. It means
that you are asked to leave and never come back. In other words, you
have been kicked out.

More benignly, expel can mean discharge: if you're having a
water-fountain spitting-fight, you are hoping to expel water from your
mouth in the direction of your opponent before they can get you. But
don't do this; you won't get expelled from school, but the germs in
your body will be expelled all over your friends.

He said he would request she be expelled.
* flunked :Quora:
[2016-08-31 Wed 19:27]

завалила

verb
 1. провалить (vote down, damn, flunk, plow, snow under, screw up)
 2. провалиться на экзамене (flunk, fail, fail an examination, ball up)
 3. провалить на экзамене (flunk)
 4. исключать (exclude, rule out, eliminate, delete, expel, flunk)
 5. быть исключенным (flunk)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. fail to reach the required standard in (an examination, test, or course of study).
    "I flunked biology in the tenth grade"

To flunk is to do poorly on a test or in a class. One way to avoid
flunking is to start studying several nights before a test.

People have been flunking things ever since there were schools.
However, we’ve only been calling it flunking since the 1800s.
Originally, flunk could mean “to fail” or “to give up.” That’s a good
reminder that sometimes, to avoid flunking, you just need to keep
trying.

He flunked in mathematics in class 12.
* supplementary :Quora:
[2016-08-31 Wed 19:28]

/ˌsʌp ləˈmɛn tə ri/
дополнительный

adjective
 1. дополнительный (additional, more, further, complementary, extra, supplementary)
 2. добавочный (additional, extra, surplus, supplementary, plus, complementary)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. completing or enhancing something.
    "the center's work was to be seen as supplementary to orthodox treatment and not a substitute for it"

noun
 1. a supplementary person or thing.
    "Obviously we are a panel of three and different members of the panel will explore different issues, but we may well ask supplementaries in order that we can ensure that the areas on which we require further information are well explored."


Supplementary is a little something extra to fill in a gap, like when
your teacher suggests supplementary reading material that you may or
may not get around to checking out.

Supplementary can be an important part of something or just extra
support. The word supplement comes from the Latin supplementum for
"something added to fix a deficiency" and the suffix -ary means
"connected with." Put them together and you have something connected
with filling in. The supplementary support of digging a moat around
your sand castle might save it from a wave, but that supplementary
reading on your syllabus isn't required (although it might save your
grade).

He got a supplementary and after a Lot of efforts he just somehow
cleared his supplementary exam.

* litigation :Quora:
[2016-08-31 Wed 19:30]

Litigation is what goes on in court; it is the name for the process of
suing someone or trying them for a crime. When families fight over
their inheritance, the assets they want may end up being tied up for
decades in litigation.

If you paid a man to repair your roof and he never finished the job,
and he ignores your calls, the best option is to bring litigation
against him: take him to court! We can use litigation to talk about
one court case, or about cases in general. When the Congress debates
health care, they try to find ways to reduce for medical malpractice
litigation, which is one of the most expensive aspects of medicine.

* moot 								      :Quora:
[2016-08-31 Wed 19:31]

When a point is moot, it's too trivial to think about. If your
basketball team loses by 40 points, the bad call by the official in
the first quarter is moot: it isn't important.

Though moot can mean to debate endlessly without any clear decision or
to think about something carefully, it most often describes ideas and
arguments that don't really matter. If your plane is crashing, whether
or not your socks match is a moot point. When someone accuses you of
making a moot point, he's basically saying, "Come on! Let's talk about
what's important." As with so many things, people don't always agree
on what's moot and what's not.

[2016-08-31 Wed 19:45]

/rɪˈmɪt ns/ 

A remittance is a payment that gets sent somewhere else. If you get a
bill in the mail, you will usually have at least a week to send your
remittance.

To "remit" is to send money or make a payment and what you send is
called remittance. Buying anything from a website involves a
remittance — usually from a grownup's credit card, just as keeping
your cell phone going requires a regular remittance to cover minutes
and messages. If you go on a trip and run out of money, you might need
an emergency remittance for a plane or train ticket to get home.

* decidedly :Quora:
[2016-08-31 Wed 19:49]

Something described as being decidedly a certain way is absolutely
that way, with no hint of doubt. If a character in a movie is
decidedly evil, there's no question in your mind about it, it's so
clearly true.

The adverb decidedly is good for providing a strong emphasis. Your mom
might be decidedly unhappy about your new car, or your grades might be
decidedly improving this semester. In both cases, these things are
undeniably clear. Decidedly comes from the adjective decided, or
"resolute," from the Latin root decidere, "to decide or determine."

* riveted :Quora:
[2016-08-31 Wed 19:56]

A rivet is a metal fastener, a bolt-like device that holds together
two pieces of metal or fabric. The round metal fasteners on your
favorite pair of jeans are rivets.

Older buildings with metal frames like the Eiffel Tower are held
together with rivets, and so are some bridges and military vehicles.
Furniture upholstery often involves rivets, too. When you use a rivet
to fasten, you can say you rivet — and similarly, to hold attention or
captivate is also to rivet. The Old French root is river, "to clench
or fasten."

I finished college because I had to but never felt riveted by the
classes that I took.

* neatness :Quora:
[2016-08-31 Wed 19:58]

Neatness is a habit or quality of being tidy. Your neatness will come
in handy when you apply for a job sweeping the floor in a barber shop.

Your neatness shows in your well-organized desk, your spic-and-span
bedroom, and even your well-groomed hairdo and tidy outfit. When you
work as a pharmacist or a chemist or an Army sergeant, neatness is
important for doing your job well. Neatness comes from neat and its
Middle French root net, "clear or pure." The Latin source is nitidus,
"gleaming."

Title: How can one become a neatness freak?

* begging :Quora:

 1. галдеть (clamor, din, clamour)
 2. кричать (shout, cry, yell, holler, call out, clamor)
 3. шумно требовать (clamor, clamour)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. (of a group of people) shout loudly and insistently.

So why bother bringing in laborers who'll be taxing the system when
they are all out of work and clamoring for food and medicine?
* resuscitation :Quora:
[2016-09-04 Mon 12:15]

Resuscitation is the action of bringing someone back to consciousness.
Ambulance workers are skilled at resuscitation.

To resuscitate is to revive someone who has passed out: this act is
called resuscitation. If someone needs resuscitation, something
serious has happened — the person has lost consciousness and may be on
the verge of death. You've probably heard of "mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation," which is one method of reviving. Medical professionals
have many other techniques and gadgets that aid resuscitation. The
Latin root word is resuscitare, "rouse again, or revive," from re and
suscitare, "to raise."

* hinder :Quora:
[2016-09-05 Mon 20:55]

препятствовать

verb
 1. препятствовать (let, prevent, hinder, impede, inhibit, hamper)
 2. мешать (interfere, disturb, prevent, stir, interrupt, hinder)
 3. быть помехой (interfere, hinder, handicap)

adjective
 1. задний (rear, back, posterior, hind, tail, hinder)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. (especially of a bodily part) rear; hind.
    "the hinder end of its body"

verb
 1. create difficulties for (someone or something), resulting in delay or obstruction.
    "various family stalemates were hindering communication"

The verb hinder means to block or put something in the way of, so if
you’re in a high-speed car chase with the police, they might put up a
blockade to hinder your progress.

The word hinder came from the Old English hindrian, which means to
"injure or damage." That's a little more extreme than what it means
today, because, now it just means to get in the way of something or
someone. People might not like you too much if you make it a practice
to hinder their progress or get in the way of things they want, even
it's a small hindrance like blocking someone from getting to the
cookie jar.

My body works like a well-oiled

* tenure :Quora:
[2016-09-05 Mon 21:10]

срок пребывания

noun
 1. срок пребывания (tenure)
 2. пребывание (residence, stay, staying, tenure, indwelling, abode)
 3. владение (possession, ownership, hold, domain, tenure, command)
 4. пребывание в должности (tenure, incumbency, tour of duty)
 5. срок владения (tenure)
 6. недвижимость (real estate, real property, immovables, realty, tenure)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. the conditions under which land or buildings are held or occupied.
    "But without exception, these big operations use leased land, with tenures typically of two to five years."
 2. the holding of an office.
    "his tenure of the premiership would be threatened"
 3. guaranteed permanent employment, especially as a teacher or professor, after a probationary period.
    "College/university music teachers have tenure , rank and their employer's standards that provide professional status for them."

verb
 1. give (someone) a permanent post, especially as a teacher or professor.
    "I had recently been tenured and then promoted to full professor"

Take the noun tenure for the period of time a person holds a position
or office. Your tenure as a student ends when you graduate high school
— unless, of course, you go on to college.

Tenure from the Latin tenere means "to hold" and refers to the period
of time a person works at a particular job or in an office. A
president might have to deal with a recession during his tenure in the
White House. In university jargon, if you have tenure, you have a
permanent teaching position or professorship. In this sense, tenure
can also be used as a verb. You've got it made if you're tenured at
age 29.

As Douglas Adolph implies, people who join a company move to
increasingly senior positions over their tenure.

 5. ватин (batting, wadding, padding, bat)
 6. наваривание подушки (padding)

    "a padded envelope"

    "she padded along the corridor"

A cushioning or protective material is padding. When you're moving
into a new apartment, you might want to wrap your dishes in padding to
keep them from being damaged.

Padding has many different uses, from the padding in a padded mailing
envelope to the padding in a sofa cushion that gives you a soft place
to sit. There's also padding inside protective sports gear and built
into yoga mats. Sometimes padding is simply used to make something
seem bigger, and from this meaning comes the sense of padding meaning
"unnecessary extra material," especially superfluous words in a speech
or a book.


* billowing :Quora:

вздымающиеся

verb
 1. вздыматься (billow, surge, heave, shoot up, run high, crest)
 2. вздыматься волнами (billow)
 3. волноваться (worry, bother, fluster, be agitated, sweat, wave)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. (of fabric) fill with air and swell outward.
    "her dress billowed out around her"

If you've ever seen a space shuttle launch, you probably remember
seeing all the white smoke billowing, or swelling and rolling forth,
underneath.

You'll most often see the word billowing when someone is talking about
smoke, steam, or the wind blowing through something, like hair or a
flag. The word bylgja, from which billow derives, comes from an
unusual source for English words: Old Norse.

Any movie where things blow up in a huge billowing cloud of fire.

* affirmation :Quora:
[2016-10-02 Sun 10:36]

An affirmation is a big fat YES, an assertion that something is true.

Affirmations can show up in court, or taped to the walls of people who
need reassurance. In court, it's a judgment from a higher court that
agrees with one from a lower one, or something a religious person who
doesn't want to take an oath can use. Quakers use affirmations on the
stand instead of swearing, because they always speak plainly. It means
to assure, or agree, so you might find affirmations like "You're
awesome!" or "Lookin' good" taped to the mirror of people who need to
chin up.

I've found no affirmation, no incantation as effective a
motivational tool as my mission statement.

words -– in English literature.

Incantation shares a Latin source with enchant, both of which are
related to chant. An incantation, then, summons a thing or action into
being with words that are sung, spoken, or written. Long before it
became the catchword of stage magicians, abracadabra was regarded as a
powerful incantation capable of warding off serious disease. The
phrase hocus pocus may be a corruption of a seventeenth-century
incantation spoken during the Roman Catholic liturgy of the Eucharist,
"hoc est corpus."

I've found no affirmation, no incantation as effective a
motivational tool as my mission statement.
* discern :Quora:
[2016-10-11 Tue 20:34]

If you can make out, pick out, or distinguish something, you can
discern it. This is a word for recognizing and perceiving things.

Discerning has to do with being able to see or hear something. In a
loud room, it can be hard to discern one person's voice. If there's
not much light, you'll have trouble discerning the words on a page
well enough to read. If you have sloppy handwriting, then it's hard to
discern what you wrote. When you can discern something, you can tell
what it is; you can identify it.

When you discern the most efficient way to baking that
cake, you use an algorithm.
* scooped :Quora:
[2016-10-12 Wed 21:36]

Most people think of ice cream when they think of the noun scoop, but
journalists who get a story before others also get a scoop, and dog
owners need to scoop up after their dogs or else they will get a
ticket for littering.

When a newspaper reporter gets a scoop, it means they beat every other
reporter to publish an important story. Other meanings of scoop come
from the shape and motion of a scoop, which is hollowed out and looks
kind of like a pocket. Also, if you pick up a little dog into your
arms, you might say you scooped it up. Scoop is one of many words that
can be a noun and a verb, even in the same sentence: when you go to an
ice cream shop you can ask your server to give you one, two, or three
scoops.

Me and my friend ran towards her, my friend being closer to her hugged
her from her waist and scooped her out (thanks to her skinny physique
and the incredible reflexes of my friend).
* constipated :Quora:
[2016-10-12 Wed 21:38]

запорами

adjective
 1. страдающий запором (constipated, costive, bound, confined)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. (of a person or animal) affected with constipation.
    "For instance, women often don't take iron pills in pregnancy because they get constipated and assume that this is the effect of the iron."

I was getting super constipated because I was uncomfortable
using the restroom to poop while in such close proximity to my

* worn :Quora:
[2016-10-25 Tue 18:19]

изношенный

adjective
 1. заношенный (worn, dirty)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. damaged and shabby as a result of much use.
    "a worn, frayed denim jacket"

verb
 1. have on one's body or a part of one's body as clothing, decoration, protection, or for some other purpose.
    "he was wearing a dark suit"
 2. damage, erode, or destroy by friction or use.
    "the track has been worn down in part to bare rock"
 3. withstand continued use or life in a specified way.
    "a carpet-type finish seems to wear well"
 4. (of a period of time) pass, especially slowly or tediously.
    "as the afternoon wore on, he began to look unhappy"
 5. bring (a ship) about by turning its head away from the wind.
    "Shannon gives the order to wear ship"

You're just a lazy slob who's starting to get
fat, worn out and ugly.
* apathetic :Quora:
[2016-10-25 Tue 18:21]

Apathetic is an adjective that describes the feeling of being bored
with what’s going on around you. If you don’t care one way or another,
you’re apathetic.

The Greek word pathos describes a type of emotional suffering that
afflicts people who are super sensitive to their environment. Pathos
is a root word of apathetic, but the prefix a- turns it into the
opposite: emotional boredom, insensitivity, and a lack of enthusiasm.
Maybe you feel apathetic because nothing around you stirs your
interest, or maybe it’s because you need some coffee.

It was a financial anchor that weighed me down
for so long and gave me an apathetic view towards credit that lead me
to owing a similar amount on my credit card by the time I was 29.
* skimp :Quora:
[2016-10-25 Tue 18:28]

The verb skimp refers to using a limited amount of something. When
tomato prices are high, a cost-conscious restaurant might skimp on the
amount of chopped tomatoes it puts on salads.

Skimp can also describe getting by spending very little money, like
someone who skimps in order to save for the future. You can also skimp
on time and effort, like when you skimp on the amount of care you put
into your math homework. Skimp is likely a variation of scrimp, which
means "to make too small" and comes from the Swedish word skrumpna,
meaning "to shrink, shrivel up."

Title: What's something you used to skimp on, until you tried high quality and now you can't go back?
* abysmal :Quora:
[2016-10-25 Tue 18:29]

If you want to say something is really, really bad — then call it
abysmal. If one person shows up to your party, well then that is an
abysmal turnout. The 1958 Ford Edsel? An abysmal failure.

When someone describes the hole you just dug as abysmal, you may not
know whether to take it as positive or negative feedback. That's
because starting in the 1650s, abysmal simply meant “resembling an
abyss in depth.” By that definition you've just received a compliment
on your deep digging skills. But since the early twentieth century,
abysmal has been more commonly used to identify something as
"extremely bad." So it's more likely that your hole has just been
insulted.

  Because of my abysmal experience with cheap laptops, I had to get
  one of the toughest, meanest looking and idiot-proof laptops in
  existence today.
* sturdiness :Quora:
[2016-10-25 Tue 18:32]

крепкость

noun
 1. крепкость (sturdiness)

No other laptop I have set my hands on (apart from maybe a
  MacBook) comes even close to the quality and sturdiness of these
  machines.
* sluggishly :Quora:
[2016-10-25 Tue 18:33]

инертно

adverb
 1. вяло (sluggishly, inertly, drowsily, flabbily, sleepily, torpidly)
 2. лениво (idly, sluggishly, sleepily, loungingly)
 3. медлительно (sluggishly)
 4. инертно (inertly, stagnantly, sluggishly, supinely)

It was dirt cheap, but still works fine (although a bit sluggishly) up to today.
* reconciliation :Quora:
[2016-10-25 Tue 20:19]

Reconciliation is the act of getting two things to be compatible with
one another. You might have a reconciliation with a former enemy, or
your mom might call for a reconciliation between your spending habits
and your diminishing bank account.

If you want to do something on Friday night, but your friend is trying
to save money, going to a free art gallery opening would be a
reconciliation of both your desires. Reconciliation can also mean the
reestablishment of civil relations after a conflict. If you and your
friend got into an argument over what to do Friday night, you’d need
to have a reconciliation before you go hang out.

Being the
  'better' man often involves initiating forgiveness and
  reconciliation.
* revelation :Quora:
[2016-10-25 Tue 20:32]

Discovering that you had a long-lost sister would definitely be a
revelation, or a surprising realization. Finding out she had been
living in the house next door for years would be an even more
startling revelation!

It is not a surprise that the word revelation is related to the word
reveal, because revealing is the action of showing something that was
previously covered up or unknown. You can even use both words in the
same sentence: "You might find it a revelation if someone revealed to
you that your house was sitting on top of a gold mine!"

I think Python is a good language for learning, and I think when it
came out, it must have seemed like a revelation, but once Java
appeared, then C#, Python started to look old fashioned and never
really caught up, which is not surprising considering the budgets
Microsoft and Sun/Oracle/IBM were working with.
* attrition :Quora:
[2016-10-27 Thu 20:59]

потертость

noun
 1. потертость (attrition)
 2. истощение (depletion, exhaustion, attrition, emaciation, starvation, debilitation)
 3. истирание (abrasion, attrition, wear, abrading, seizing)
 4. изнурение (attrition, emaciation, maceration, inanition, fag, extenuation)
 5. истертость (attrition)
 6. трение (friction, abrasion, rubbing, rub, attrition, chafing)
 7. отсев (screening, attrition)
 8. изнашивание от трения (attrition, detrition)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. the action or process of gradually reducing the strength or effectiveness of someone or something through sustained attack or pressure.
    "the council is trying to wear down the opposition by attrition"
 2. (in scholastic theology) sorrow, but not contrition, for sin.
    "I should mention before I go through with this final act of attrition that if I misbehaved so egregiously over the past year, it must certainly reflect negatively on you both as parents."

Attrition is a gradual process of wearing down, weakening, or
destroying something.

When a company wants to reduce its payroll without firing anyone, it
will sometimes do so through attrition; that is, by waiting for people
to retire or quit without hiring anyone new to replace them. In a more
general sense, the word means break down, wear out, or reduce in
numbers. A triple overtime basketball game, with many players fouling
out, is a war of attrition. When you see the word attrition, think
"Gradually chipping away."

Title: After coming from learning Python, why does Java feel like a war of attrition against the computer?
* plow :Quora:
[2016-10-30 Sun 11:11]

A plow is a large tool used for farming. A farmer drives or pulls a
plow across a field to prepare it for planting.

The large blades of a plow break up the earth, cutting and turning it
so it's loose and ready to be planted with seeds. When you operate a
plow, you can say that you plow. Boats can plow through water, too —
in fact, anything that moves forcibly forward also plows: a car plows
through traffic, and figuratively, a student plows through her
homework.

It's getting "in the zone" and allows time to fly by while you plow
through a lot of work.
* contender :Quora:
[2016-10-30 Sun 11:14]

Baseball players, boxers, politicians: each is a contender in that
they compete or campaign to win something.

Contender has a slightly different meaning than competitor, often
implying a more vigorous, even scrappier, sense of taking on every
unexpected challenge. The most famous use of contender is Marlon
Brando's quote in the film On The Waterfront. Brando plays a once
promising boxer whose career has been ruined by a fixed fight. "I
coulda been a contender!" Brando cried, implying he could have been
the boxer whom everyone wanted to defeat.

I had a contender this afternoon.
* attend :Quora:
[2016-10-30 Sun 11:17]

The verb attend means to be present, to listen, or give care or
attention to. You can attend your family reunion, attend to a project
you've been ignoring, or attend to your teacher's voice.

When you use attend as "pay attention" or "take care of," it's
followed by "to." When you use attend as in "attend a party," you
don't. If you attend a political rally, you'll want to attend to what
the politicians have to say. When you take attendance, you are
checking which students have chosen to attend class, i.e. who is in
attendance.

When I told her that I was hoping to attend, she thanked me
for thinking of her.
* tractable :Quora:
[2016-10-30 Sun 11:18]

If your little brother quietly obeys your instructions and waits for
you at the food court while you and your friends wander around the
mall, he's probably a tractable child, meaning he's obedient,
flexible, and responds well to directions.

Note the similarity between tractable and tractor. Both come from the
Latin word tractare, which originally meant "to drag about." You can
think of a tractable person as someone who can be dragged about
easily, like a plow being dragged by a tractor.

Because they haven't walked up and down the hills and haven't hit the
dead ends and the brambles before, so it feels like a much more
tractable problem or task than it actually is.

* skimp :Quora:
[2016-11-05 Sat 20:50]

The verb skimp refers to using a limited amount of something. When
tomato prices are high, a cost-conscious restaurant might skimp on the

Skimp can also describe getting by spending very little money, like
someone who skimps in order to save for the future. You can also skimp
on time and effort, like when you skimp on the amount of care you put

неряшливый

adjective
 1. грязный (dirty, messy, filthy, muddy, foul, scruffy)
 2. неряшливый (sloppy, sleazy, slovenly, grubby, scruffy, unkempt)
 3. нечесаный (unkempt, uncombed, frowsy, scruffy, ragged, frowzy)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. shabby and untidy or dirty.
    "dressed in scruffy jeans and a baggy T-shirt"

He looked scruffy and had the sort of bulky muscles you get by
working out a lot.
* intimidated :Quora:
[2016-11-05 Sat 21:30]

When a person has been threatened and made to feel timid, he becomes
intimidated. You might be intimidated by a large barking dog, a mean
boss, or a pair of skinny jeans you'd love to fit into.

The adjective intimidated is derived from the similarly spelled Latin
intimidare, meaning “to frighten." Notice within both the English
adjective and Latin root another adjective timid, “fearful.” That
should help you remember the meaning. Maya Angelou said, “Education
helps one cease being intimidated by strange situations.” When you are
familiar with something, it becomes less frightful. Synonyms for
intimidated include afraid and daunted.

Please please,
pretty please, don't be intimidated by that.
* obscenely :Quora:

непристойно

adverb
 1. непристойно (obscenely, indecently, salaciously, scurrilously)
 2. бесстыдно (obscenely)

Title: Why are some software engineers being paid obscenely huge salaries even for junior level roles in the SF Bay Area?
* epitome :Quora:
[2016-11-05 Sat 21:34]

If you're talking about a typical example of something, call it the
epitome. The cartoon character Garfield is the epitome of the fat,
lazy, food-obsessed cat.

Coming to us from Greek through Latin, epitome refers to something
that is the ultimate representative of its class. Are you the epitome
of the hard-working student or do you believe in study in moderation?
Make sure you pronounce epitome with the accent on the second syllable
(uh-PIH-tuh-mee).

"she looked the epitome of elegance and good taste"

* courtesy :Quora:
[2016-11-05 Sat 21:35]

A courtesy is a polite remark or respectful act. Complain about a bad
meal, and you might get kicked out. But the common courtesy is usually
an apology from the manager and, if you're lucky, a free dinner.

Courtesy is all about using your good manners, which is why it shares
roots with the word courteous. Holding the door open for someone,
writing a thank-you note for a gift, and letting the pregnant lady
have the last seat on the bus are all courtesies that would make your
parents proud. And if something is kindly presented to you free of
charge, the gift-giver may say it's "courtesy of" someone special.

"he had been treated with a degree of courtesy not far short of deference"
* contemplative :Quora:
[2016-11-10 Thu 18:04]

The contemplative life is one filled with deep and serious thought,
and is often associated with monks, nuns, philosophers, and theorists.

The adjective contemplative means "pensive," "meditative," or
"brooding." Contemplative moments, of course, aren't restricted to
white-bearded hermits living in caves on mountaintops. You might also
hear the word when people are talking about yoga or meditation, as
these are quiet activities meant to be thoughtfully performed. Some
kinds of poetry and music are described as contemplative, especially
if they give you space to daydream or think about their themes. A walk
through nature can also be a contemplative activity.

These are known as 'contemplative routines' or
'contemplative devices.'
* imbue :Quora:
[2016-11-10 Thu 18:11]

To imbue is to fill up with or become "soaked" in an idea or emotion,
as a sponge takes in water. One visit to Africa might be enough to
imbue ambitions in a medical student to return to heal the sick.

You can use imbue in a similar way as "saturate," or "soak through,"
to describe a filling or absorbing. A "hue" is a color, and it rhymes
with imbue. When you're imbued with something, you are, in a way,
colored by it. If you imbue a dish sponge with oily orange water from
a spaghetti bowl, the color and the oil soak in. To fill people with
qualities or emotions is, for example, to imbue them with strength or
optimism.

Bu the point is this: the most productive people take their daily
habits and routines and they try to imbue them with aspects that
encourage them to think more deeply.
* mere :Quora:
[2016-11-14 Mon 14:37]

Mere means pure and simple, nothing more and nothing less. If the mere
mention of someone's name makes you happy, then just hearing his name
— and that alone — is enough to make you smile.

Mere can have a little irony attached. If you introduce yourself as "a
mere student," when you’re announcing your astounding invention,
you're contrasting your lowly status with the enormity of your
invention. This kind of mere comes from the Latin for "undiluted."
Mere has a homograph — a completely different word that's spelled the
same — and this mere means a lake or a pond. It’s related to the Dutch
word meer — there’s lots of water in Holland.

At that time, a debate had been raging over
the origin of life; Could life possibly form from mere chemicals?
* loamy :Quora:

суглинистый

adjective
 1. суглинистый (loamy)
 2. мергельный (loamy, marly)

Into this

similar to loamy soil, some wondered whether it may hint at the
existence of extra-terrestrial life.
* ensuing :Quora:
[2016-11-14 Mon 14:40]

If you go snowboarding in a leotard, prepare for an ensuing cold.
Ensuing means "coming right after, or as a result of something that
happened."

Ensuing is the adjective form of the verb ensue, which comes from the
Old French ensuivre, which means "following in." We usually use it to
show cause and effect. Blame your for entrepreneurial friend taking
bets in the lunchroom for the ensuing crackdown on employee gambling.
An ensuing event happens right after its cause. If a dog bites you
when you're eight, and twenty years later you start having nightmares
about dog bites, those aren't ensuing nightmares. They're surfacing
memories.

Nevertheless,
the mere possibility prompted later ideas that the origin of life on
earth indeed lay elsewhere in the universe, ideas that were greeted
with varying degrees of scepticism over ensuing decades.
* satiate :Quora:
[2016-11-14 Mon 14:43]

If you just can't get enough popcorn, even the jumbo tub at the movie
theater may not be enough to satiate, or satisfy, your desire.

Satiate is often used in situations in which a thirst, craving, or
need is satisfied. However, when satiate is used to describe eating,
it can take on a more negative, or even disgusted, tone. If you
comment that the diners at the world's largest all-you-can eat buffet
were satiated, you might not mean that they were merely satisfied. You
could be implying that they've been gluttons, and that they are now
overstuffed with fried chicken wings and mac and cheese.

Reading / writing - To satiate the hunger of mind and to spread the

* splurging :Quora:
[2016-11-14 Mon 14:47]

To splurge is to indulge yourself. You can also go on a splurge if you
spend a lot or act extravagantly in another way.

Anyone might have a cupcake. If you have 10 cupcakes, that's a
splurge. When you go on a splurge or are splurging, it usually applies
to money. Splurging happens when you see a lot of things you want — or
even one very expensive thing — and buy it, even though you might not
be able to afford it. When you splurge, you're going wild in some way.
A splurge is sometimes called a binge.

4 Food - splurging, and impulse buying is a unhealthy habit.
* hokey :Quora:
[2016-11-14 Mon 14:51]

Something that's hokey is silly and sentimental — you could also call
it "sappy" or "mawkish." A hokey speech is more likely to make people
roll their eyes and squirm than to make them cry.

You can buy your friend a hokey birthday card as a joke, or read her a
hokey poem to make her laugh. There's a hint of insincerity when
something's hokey — people can tell that the sentiments in your hokey
yearbook quote aren't entirely genuine. In the mid-1800s, hokey-pokey
was defined as "false, cheap material," possibly based on hocus-pocus,
and usually referring to artificial flavoring in cheap ice cream.
Today, the hokey-pokey is mainly known as a silly dance.

This is going to sound hokey, but the truth is: I gave birth.
* sincere :Quora:
[2016-11-14 Mon 14:56]

искренний

adjective
 1. искренний (sincere, genuine, candid, heartfelt, honest, earnest)
 2. душевный (soulful, sincere, heartwarming, heartful, internal)
 3. задушевный (sincere, soulful, cordial)
 4. честный (honest, fair, honorable, upright, sincere, straight)
 5. чистосердечный (frank, sincere, candid, free-hearted, open-hearted)
 6. прямой (direct, right, straight, outright, straightforward, sincere)
 7. чистый (clean, pure, net, clear, unadulterated, sincere)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. free from pretense or deceit; proceeding from genuine feelings.
    "they offer their sincere thanks to Paul"

Being sincere is being genuine. If someone compliments you on your
outfit, but you notice them rolling their eyes when they think you’re
not looking, they probably weren't being sincere.

If you've been offered a sincere thanks for something you've done, the
person is probably really grateful. Sometimes when people say "thank
you," they don't always mean it, but when they add the adjective
sincere, the emphasis is usually for a very good reason. You may hear
a charity sending out a sincere thanks to sponsors for their
donations, which help keep the charity running.

Participants in the series of studies were randomly assigned to
    have a conversation that was either sarcastic, sincere, or
    neutral.

* alleviate :Quora:
[2016-11-20 Sun 17:24]

облегчать

verb
 1. облегчать (facilitate, alleviate, ease, relieve, lighten, enable)
 2. смягчать (soften, mitigate, remit, alleviate, moderate, cushion)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. make (suffering, deficiency, or a problem) less severe.
    "he couldn't prevent her pain, only alleviate it"

Do all these words make your head ache? If so, take an aspirin to
alleviate, or relieve, your pain.

The verb, alleviate, stems from the Latin root, levis "light" and is
related to modern English words such as elevator and levitate — both
words implying a lightening of one's load. Alleviate also has this
sense of lightening a burden such as physical pain or emotional
duress. You can take medicine to alleviate symptoms or do exercise to
alleviate stress. Or if you want a bigger challenge: try alleviating
traffic congestion or world hunger.

Algorithms and Design Patterns can help to
alleviate some of that rugged and, sometimes, messy code.
* rugged :Quora:
[2016-11-20 Sun 17:25]

Terrain that is broken and uneven is called rugged. If you want an
easy hike, you should stay away from the rugged coastline. That rocky
shoreline is definitely for the more experienced hikers.

The same sense of unevenness applies to other things that are
described as rugged. If someone tells a man that he has a rugged face,
it's meant to compliment his rough, strong looks. Rugged can also
describe something that is steady, sturdy, and strong. Only your
rugged constitution will keep you alive in that period of famine

* praise :Quora:
[2016-11-20 Sun 17:36]

Praise means "admiration or approval," and when you're on the
receiving end of it, you feel great.

Whether it's used as a verb or a noun, praise means "approval." If you
enthusiastically praise your dog, he's likely to wag his tail and
expect a treat. What you've given him (in addition to the treat) is
praise, the noun. In a religious context, the verb praise is
interchangeable with worship, as when a minister says, "Praise God."

Tell a story about them and praise them.
* presume :Quora:
[2016-11-20 Sun 17:43]

If you presume something, it means you act as though it's true before
all the evidence is in. If you are presumed to be the fastest runner,
don't get too cocky — that word implies that you haven't actually
raced yet.

To presume is to take something for granted. The famous quote “Dr.
Livingstone, I presume?” comes from the explorer Henry Morton Stanley,
who ran into the explorer David Livingstone in the wilds of Africa in
1871. It’s funny because these were the only two white men known to be
in that part of Africa at the time.

Third thing: if you're a civilian with no prior regional experience

warfighting in Iraq than I do.
* privy :Quora:
[2016-11-20 Sun 17:44]

If you're privy to something, you've been let in on a secret or know
about something that most people don't. Not many people are privy to
what those top secret documents are all about, for example.

The adjective privy comes from the Latin privatus, meaning “private,”
and describes someone who has knowledge of secret or confidential
information. But watch out: If you use privy as a noun, it can mean
“outhouse” or “toilet,” which actually might be a good place to hide
your diary if you don't want anyone else to be privy to its contents.

You are entitled to have a different
opinion, but when it comes to facts, I'm privy to more of them than
you are.

пересечение

noun
 1. пересечение (intersection, crossing, traversal, confluence, decussation, conflux)

* sequel :Quora:
[2016-11-21 Mon 16:41]

A sequel is a continuation or part two. The Empire Strikes Back and
Toy Story 2 are sequels. Many successful movies have sequels.

The most common meaning of sequel is for a book or movie that follows
another, but the term can be used for just about anything that comes
second. We might say of an actress who begins her career with a bang,
"What will she do for a sequel?" A football team that wins a
championship may have trouble with the sequel — trying to win another
one next year. All sequels have a tough challenge — living up to the
original.

In the sequel, because there is a one-to-one correspondence between nodes
and the subtrees rooted by them, we sometimes leave it to the context
whether the name of an object stands for the node or the subtree.

DEFINITION

verb
 1. make someone or something free of (a troublesome or unwanted person or thing).
    "we now have the greatest chance ever to rid the world of nuclear weapons"

When you clear out or eliminate something you don't want, you rid
yourself of it. If even one child is allergic to peanuts, a school
will often rid the cafeteria of all food made with peanuts.

For years, activists have worked to rid the world of nuclear weapons,
while a dieter's priority might be to rid himself of ten extra pounds.
Freeing someone from something unwanted is to rid them of it, whether
it's ants in their kitchen or stress about their job. In the
thirteenth century, rid meant "clear a space, set free, or save," from
a Scandinavian root that's related to the Old Norse ryðja, "to clear
land of obstructions."

* brambles :Quora:
[2016-11-24 Thu 20:28]

a prickly scrambling vine or shrub, especially a blackberry or 
other wild shrub of the rose family.

Because they haven't walked up and down the hills and haven't hit the
dead ends and the brambles before, so it feels like a much more
tractable problem or task than it actually is.
* tractable :Quora:
[2016-11-24 Thu 20:28]

If your little brother quietly obeys your instructions and waits for
you at the food court while you and your friends wander around the
mall, he's probably a tractable child, meaning he's obedient,
flexible, and responds well to directions.

Note the similarity between tractable and tractor. Both come from the
Latin word tractare, which originally meant "to drag about." You can
think of a tractable person as someone who can be dragged about
easily, like a plow being dragged by a tractor.

Because they haven't walked up and down the hills and haven't hit the
dead ends and the brambles before, so it feels like a much more
tractable problem or task than it actually is.
* commitment :Quora:
[2016-11-24 Thu 20:32]

Making a commitment involves dedicating yourself to something, like a
person or a cause. Before you make a commitment, think carefully. A
commitment obligates you to do something.

Some commitments are large, like marriage. When you take a job, you're
making a commitment to show up and do the job well, and your employer
makes a commitment to pay you. There are smaller commitments too. If
you said you'd meet a friend at six, that's a commitment — show up or
your friend will be mad. You also can speak of commitment as a
quality. Staying after school for a study group shows your commitment
to good grades.

Meanwhile writing requires creativity, persistence and commitment.
* perseverance :Quora:
[2016-11-24 Thu 20:45]

Perseverance is not giving up. It is persistence and tenacity, the
effort required to do something and keep doing it till the end, even
if it's hard.

Perseverance originally comes from the Latin perseverantia and means
to abide by something strictly. This makes sense, because if you're
doing something in spite of all the difficulty, you're being strict on
yourself. Sailing around the world and climbing Mt. Everest are acts
requiring perseverance. Even things like learning a new language
require perseverance and daily practice.

But ask them how they made it and they will wax poetic about
how it was all just a matter of hard work and perseverance— never mind
the foundation and framework of the public goods that enabled that to
a large degree.
* dismantle :Quora:
[2016-11-24 Thu 20:47]

To take something apart or down is to dismantle it. If you dismantle a
computer to see what it looks like inside, you better know how to put
it back together, or you might be looking at the inside of your room
for awhile.

Dismantle is a verb used for both physical things and ideas. You can
dismantle a campground by taking down the tents and breaking apart the
fire logs, or you can dismantle a government by going against its
leadership and bringing down its rule. Often when you dismantle
something, you take away its ability to work, as with a nuclear
warhead, but you can also take apart decorative or non-working things,
as when you dismantle a science-fair display or a city made of blocks.

Worse still is their attempt to dismantle and undercut that framework
now that they have theirs.
* praise :Quora:
[2016-11-26 Sat 21:06]

Praise means "admiration or approval," and when you're on the
receiving end of it, you feel great.

Whether it's used as a verb or a noun, praise means "approval." If you
enthusiastically praise your dog, he's likely to wag his tail and
expect a treat. What you've given him (in addition to the treat) is
praise, the noun. In a religious context, the verb praise is
interchangeable with worship, as when a minister says, "Praise God."

Too much praise is not good for every child.
* immersed :Quora:
[2016-11-26 Sat 21:20]

погруженный

adjective
 1. погруженный (immersed, submerged, sunk, deep, buried, intent)
 2. поглощенный (absorbed, engrossed, engaged, immersed, rapt, deep)
 3. углубленный (immersed)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. dip or submerge in a liquid.
    "immerse the paper in water for twenty minutes"
 2. involve oneself deeply in a particular activity or interest.
    "she immersed herself in her work"

If you immerse yourself in your work, you completely involve yourself
in it, spending long hours in the office and thinking about work all
the time.

Immerse can also mean to submerge in a liquid. A science experiment
might tell you to immerse a piece of paper completely in water. If you
are a swimmer immersed in a rigorous training regimen, you might be
immersing yourself in the pool several times a day.

My eyes don't get that tired so often and you get fully immersed in 
the experience.

местность

noun
 1. местность (terrain, locality, country, ground, community, situation)
 2. территория (territory, terrain, country, domain, soil, superficies)

adjective
 1. земной (terrestrial, earthly, worldly, earthy, mundane, terrain)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a stretch of land, especially with regard to its physical features.
    "they were delayed by rough terrain"


An ATV, or all-terrain vehicle, is useful for people who drive on lots
of different terrain, hence the name. Terrain is a noun used to talk
about the ground, when you're specifically interested in how it
appears or is shaped.

In times of war, you'll often hear the term "hostile terrain" used to
describe a region with lots of mountains, vast stretches of desert, or
impenetrable jungles. These are all areas of difficult terrain that
are hard to pass. Much of humankind's history can be traced by its
effort to alter the terrain. We've made mountains into meadows, rivers
into lakes, and prairies into roads, all to make the terrain more
livable for us. You could even go so far as to say that a person's
psyche is mysterious terrain.

Terrain that is broken and uneven is called rugged.

* stint :Quora:
[2016-12-07 Wed 17:35]

скупиться

verb
 1. скупиться (stint, skimp, scrimp, scant, begrudge, pinch)
 2. ограничивать (limit, restrict, confine, constrain, restrain, stint)
 3. урезать (cut, cut down, curtail, skimp, truncate, stint)

noun
 1. ограничение (limitation, restriction, restraint, bound, stint, confinement)
 2. урочная работа (task, stint, task-work)
 3. определенная норма (stint)
 4. предел (limit, range, scope, bound, margin, stint)
 5. граница (border, boundary, limit, bound, frontier, stint)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a person's fixed or allotted period of work.
    "his varied career included a stint as a magician"
 2. limitation of supply or effort.
    "a collector with an eye for quality and the means to indulge it without stint"
 3. a small short-legged sandpiper of northern Eurasia and Alaska, with a brownish back and white underparts.
    "More than half a dozen species of birds have come to roost, which include black-winged stilts, cattle and little egrets, little stints , common sandpipers, pond herons and little winged plovers."

verb
 1. supply an ungenerous or inadequate amount of (something).
    "stowage room hasn't been stinted"


The noun stint means a set amount of time in which you do something —
often work of some sort. "She served a stint in the army, followed by
a stint in an office setting, before settling on a career as a lounge
singer."

Unlike a project or vocation, a stint can refer to the stretch of time
spent doing a particular job. You apply for a job, but you refer to
your past stint in the Peace Corps. As a verb, stint means to be
sparing or frugal, or restrict in a stingy manner ("to skimp"). "The
school board chose to make cuts at the administrative level, rather
than stint on the children's education."

It’s not
  like with social media, where a 30-minute browsing session on
  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Snapchat can easily turn into a
  3-hour stint.
* betrayal :Quora:
[2016-12-08 Thu 08:34]

Betrayal means "an act of deliberate disloyalty," like when your
friend told other people all your secrets. What a betrayal!

Betrayal's root is betray, which comes from the Middle English word
bitrayen — meaning "mislead, deceive." Betrayal has to do with
destroying someone's trust, possibly by lying. If you start dating
your best friend's girlfriend behind his back, that's an act of
betrayal. Betrayal can also mean "helping an enemy," such as a person
who gives secret information to a country that is at war with his or
her own.

Title: What has been your most unexpected betrayal and what did you learn from it?

* mandatory :Quora:
[2016-12-25 Sun 17:32]

In the US, attending school through the twelfth grade, driving on the
right side of the road, and obtaining a social security number are all
mandatory. The phrase "mandatory requirement" is redundant.

A mandatory action is something that is required, obligatory, or
compulsory. Like letting your Great Aunt Edna pinch your cheeks or
passing gym to get your diploma. Mandatory is often used in opposition
to optional. If you want to compete with the swim team at school,
weeknight practices are mandatory, meaning you have to go, though the
Saturday dawn swim practice remains optional, meaning it's up to you.

There are countless beautiful
minds who consistently maintain that failure is a mandatory part of
success.
* concussion :Quora:
[2016-12-25 Sun 17:39]

A concussion is a violent blow, especially to the head, that often
injures the brain or causes a loss of consciousness — an
all-too-frequent occurrence, unfortunately, in contact sports like
football or boxing.

First used around 1400, concussion originates from the Latin
concussionem, which means "a shaking." Your brain certainly gets "a
shaking" when you take a heavy blow to the head, which sometimes
causes injury or permanent damage. It's not just people, though, who
get concussions; a building can also suffer from a concussion during
an earthquake.

When I was 20 years old, one of my many failures in judgement resulted
in me getting a rather severe concussion.
* chops :Quora:
[2016-12-25 Sun 17:59]

To chop is to cut something by hacking at it. In many places, there
are farms where you can chop down your own Christmas tree.

When you chop wood, you usually hit it with an axe, splitting each
length into narrow pieces. A chef uses a knife to chop, hacking an
onion into tiny bits, for example. When it's a piece of meat that's
cut so it's attached to a bone, such as part of a rib, it can be
described as a chop — like a lamb chop. And if someone claps his hands
at you and says, "Chop-chop!" he means "Hurry up!"

If he has deep understanding of a dozen languages then damn, that guy
knows his chops.
* withstand :Quora:
[2016-12-29 Thu 17:59]
выдерживать

verb
 1. противостоять (resist, withstand, confront, counter, match, front)
 2. выдерживать (withstand, stand, survive, support, sustain, bear)
 3. выстоять (withstand, stand out, outstay)
 4. сопротивляться (resist, oppose, fight back, withstand, stand against, antagonize)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. remain undamaged or unaffected by; resist.
    "the structure had been designed to withstand winds of more than 100 mph"

In the story of the three little pigs, only the house made of brick
was able to withstand the huffing and puffing of the Big Bad Wolf. To
withstand is to hold up against something strong.

Withstand means to stand your ground against a powerful and negative
force. A lot of toys can withstand rough treatment, but CDs definitely
can't. And hopefully, you can withstand the pressures of school and
work! If you can withstand a lot of criticism, it means you can take
it without giving up.

If
physically you're feeling good and have the requisite energy for productivity, emotionally you're stable and able
to withstand the stress of having a lot to do, and mentally you aren't bogged down by identifying with every
passing thought, then you have set yourself up for maximum productivity.
* feasible :Quora:
[2016-12-29 Thu 18:10]

выполнимый

adjective
 1. осуществимый (feasible, workable, enforceable, realizable, practicable, implementable)
 2. возможный (possible, feasible, eventual, potential, probable, likely)
 3. выполнимый (executable, feasible, doable, workable, implementable, manageable)
 4. вероятный (likely, probable, possible, credible, plausible, feasible)
 5. исполнимый (executable, feasible)
 6. правдоподобный (plausible, probable, colorable, specious, verisimilar, feasible)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. possible to do easily or conveniently.
    "it is not feasible to put most finds from excavations on public display"

If something is feasible, then you can do it without too much
difficulty. When someone asks "Is it feasible?" the person is asking
if you'll be able to get something done.

Feasible things are possible. If you have enough time, money, or
energy to do something, it's feasible. Something might be feasible at
one time and then not feasible at another time. Because of
technological advances and competition with the Russians, going to the
moon was feasible for the United States in the sixties. Often, people
disagree about what's feasible, especially in politics, where how
feasible a project is counts for a lot.

(c) Plan those steps into feasible deadlines, should be flexible enough that you don't have to stress AT ALL about
getting them done.
* astound :Quora:
[2016-12-30 Fri 17:01]

Astound means to amaze. Savants, or those with extreme brain
abnormalities, can astound people by their ability to play Beethoven
sonatas on the piano after having heard them only once.

Astound has its roots in the verb astonish, originally meaning to
stun, and the idea of surprise remains wrapped up in the word. Things
like over-the-top fireworks, believable magicians, and the miracle of
life tend to astound. But if you lick all your favorite cookies to
keep anyone else from taking them––your rudeness could astound as
well.

The design patterns require neither unusual language features nor
amazing programming tricks with which to astound your friends and
managers.
* invariably :Quora:
[2016-12-30 Fri 17:02]

Invariably describes things that don't change and never vary — they're
predictable. Many people invariably start each morning with a hot cup
of coffee.

This adverb is useful when discussing things that happen all the time
or don't change. In football, teams that win the Super Bowl invariably
have a good defense. In schools, many students invariably struggle
with writing. Invariably, the weather is hard to predict. In a lot of
cases, invariably means always or almost always. You can count on
things that are invariable.

But the extra effort invariably pays dividends in increased
flexibility and reusability.
* gestation :Quora:
[2016-12-30 Fri 17:04]

беременность

noun
 1. беременность (pregnancy, gestation, childbearing)
 2. созревание (maturation, aging, gestation, mellowing, ageing)
 3. период беременности (gestation)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. the process of carrying or being carried in the womb between conception and birth.
    "The reproductive cycle in the adult female consists of all processes leading to conception, gestation , and birth of offspring."

Gestation is the period of time when something is conceived and
developed. The gestation period for human babies lasts nine months.

Gestation comes from the Latin gestare, which means to bear, or give
birth to. We can talk about the gestation of fetus before it's born,
but we also use gestation to talk about ideas. If you've been vaguely
thinking about starting a revolution for the last year, then that idea
has been in gestation.

This book has had a long gestation.

* comprehend :Quora:
[2017-01-02 Mon 21:37]

постигать

verb
 1. постигать (comprehend, perceive, grasp, apprehend, conceive, apperceive)
 2. понимать (understand, see, realize, comprehend, appreciate, take)
 3. уразуметь (comprehend)
 4. осмыслять (comprehend, grasp)
 5. объять (comprehend, fill)
 6. охватывать (cover, embrace, span, comprise, grasp, comprehend)
 7. включать (include, turn on, switch on, comprise, involve, comprehend)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. grasp mentally; understand.
    "he couldn't comprehend her reasons for marrying Lovat"
 2. include, comprise, or encompass.
    "a divine order comprehending all men"

To comprehend something is to understand it, like when you have to
read a difficult passage more than once in order to comprehend it.

When you comprehend something, you grasp its meaning. Comprehend is a
verb that originates from the Latin word comprehendere, which means
“catch or seize.” When an idea is clear to you and you understand it
completely, you comprehend it, like doing extra problems to make sure
you comprehend a difficult algebra rule, or finding it hard to
comprehend why someone would paint his house neon yellow.

Then,
suddenly about half way through the book or class, the explanations
switch from easy to comprehend to ‘you have to be a genius to get it!’
It goes from ‘You got this!’ to ‘ What the heck are they talking
about.’ Why that happens is a mystery to me.
* incentive :Quora:
[2017-01-02 Mon 21:39]

стимул

noun
 1. стимул (stimulus, incentive, impetus, inducement, stimulant, drive)
 2. побуждение (motivation, impulse, prompting, urge, motive, incentive)

adjective
 1. побудительный (incentive, impellent, urging)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a thing that motivates or encourages one to do something.
    "there is no incentive for customers to conserve water"

If your mom wants you to mow the lawn but you don't feel like it, she
might offer to treat you to ice cream after as an incentive. An
incentive is something that stimulates you to take action or work
harder.

This noun dates back to Middle English, from Late Latin incentivum,
from incentivus "stimulating." In Latin, incentivus meant "setting the
tune," from incinere "to sing." The related English verb is
incentivize. The less common verb incent was first used in the early
1980s, and has been criticized as business jargon.

Also, it really helps if
you have incentive such as a project or goal to program.

 3. продольная погибь (sheer)

adjective

    "she giggled with sheer delight"
 2. (especially of a cliff or wall) perpendicular or nearly so.
    "the sheer ice walls"
 3. (of a fabric) very thin; diaphanous.
    "sheer white silk chiffon"

adverb
 1. perpendicularly.
    "the ridge fell sheer, in steep crags"
 2. completely; right.
    "she went sheer forward when the door was open"

verb
 1. (typically of a boat or ship) swerve or change course quickly.
    "the boat sheered off to beach further up the coast"

noun
 1. a very fine or diaphanous fabric or article.
    "Quick to sew in less than two hours, you can sew this shrug in a variety of fabrics: sheers - such as georgette and chiffon - shantungs, linen, crepe, even velvet."
 2. a sudden deviation from a course, especially by a boat.
    "The vessel apparently, through something having gone wrong with the steering gear, took a sudden sheer to port, ran out of the channel and grounded on the edge of it."
 3. the upward slope of a ship's lines toward the bow and stern.
    "The sheer of the B40 is slightly flatter, the transom more vertical and broader, and the bow slightly less spoon-shaped."

If people can see through your shirt, it's sheer. This can also mean
something steep, like a cliff, or anything extreme, like sheer nerve.

This word has several meanings, but they're all extreme. A sheer
(see-through) shirt is an extreme way to dress — climbing a sheer
cliff is almost impossible. If your car sheers, it swerves sharply,
and you might crash. Maybe you've met all these meanings in a single
nightmare: When the sheer cloth blew over your face as you drove, you
lost control and the car began to sheer, filling you with sheer terror
as you went over the sheer cliff.

I’m too lazy to use C for everything, and in terms of sheer
productivity, I’ll take Java, but I think C was (and is) the greater
innovation, it completely defines the computing landscape we’re in
today.

уместный

adjective
 1. уместный (relevant, pertinent, opportune, apt, germane, apposite)
 2. подходящий (suitable, appropriate, right, suited, fitting, pertinent)
 3. имеющий отношение (concerned, pertinent)

noun
 1. принадлежности (accessories, materials, belongings, gear, paraphernalia, pertinent)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. relevant or applicable to a particular matter; apposite.
    "she asked me a lot of very pertinent questions"

Something pertinent is relevant and on-point. If you give your best
friend pertinent advice, that means the advice is appropriate for the
situation.

Something pertinent is related to the current topic or situation — and
probably helpful too. If you're in math class and you make a comment
about World War I, that's likely not pertinent. If you're in music
class and you talk about a cello, that probably is pertinent.
Pertinent things are appropriate and logical. In most situations,
people like to get comments and questions that are pertinent —
anything else can just seem like a distraction.

But this approach is pertinent for testing file content and not
   suitable for literate programming itself.

* buoy                                                                :Quora:
  [2017-02-08 Wed 09:06]
  
  A buoy is a floating marker that indicates the presence of underwater
  hazards, channels, or places for tying up boats. When buoy is a verb,
  it can mean to float like a buoy, literally or figuratively. Winning
  an award could buoy your spirits as if you are floating with pride.
  
  The verb buoy can mean "boost or increase." There aren't many things
  that will buoy your confidence as much as repeated compliments on how
  great your new haircut looks. Imagine seeing water buoy up an enormous
  swan, or the wind buoy up a kite. A more figurative meaning of buoy is
  to cheer or lift someone's spirits. One way to remember buoy's unusual
  spelling is the phrase, "Boats usually opt to steer around a buoy."
  
  At the bottom was a little inset which read:
  CAUTION: AS the buoys marking the shoals are often out of position,
  mariners are cautioned to be on their guard when navigating these shores.
* demolishes :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 17:33]

Demolish means “completely destroy,” as a wrecking ball might demolish
a building, or as hanging out with one’s parents might, supposedly,
demolish a teenager’s reputation.

In casual speech, demolish can also mean “devour,” as a group of
hungry teenagers might demolish a pizza. The noun form of demolish is
demolition, which often implies destruction by means of explosives.
Demolish combines the prefix de-, which can mean “undo,” with the
Latin verb moliri, meaning “to build" — which makes sense if you are
thinking of 'undoing a building' with explosives!

The other person will say something that I hadn’t considered, or that
hadn’t occurred to me, that utterly demolishes my point.
* fungible :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 17:35]
заменяемый

adjective
 1. заменяемый (replaceable, commutable, substitutable, fungible)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. (of goods contracted for without an individual specimen being specified) able to replace or be replaced by another identical item; mutually interchangeable.
    "money is fungible—money that is raised for one purpose can easily be used for another"

If something is fungible, you can exchange it for something else. Why
is it that you can trade a twenty dollar bill for a ten and two fives?
Because money's fungible!

The “g” in fungible is pronounced like a “j” or like the “g” in
“fudge,” though fungible things aren't always tasty. Fungible comes
from a Latin phrase meaning “to serve in place of” and that's what
something that's fungible does: serves in place of what it's exchanged
for.

They’re fungible.
* silo :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 17:39]

A silo is a cylindrical tower used for bulk storage, like grain silos
that stand tall near farms. Another kind of silo is harder to see —
military silos are underground.

Farming and war are pretty different, but they both involve silos. You
may have seen a silo if you've ever visited a farm. A silo is a tall
tower with a cylindrical (rounded) shape. The silo holds anything the
farmer needs to store in bulk, especially feed for the animals. Other,
non-farm silos hold material such as cement or coal. The military type
of silo holds something more dangerous: missiles. These silos store
the missiles underground until they’re fired.

Specialists stay in one silo, becoming THE authority in that silo for their company.
* carnations :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 17:48]
гвоздики

noun
 1. гвоздика (carnation, clove, pink, allspice)
 2. разные оттенки красноватых тонов (carnation)
 3. телесный цвет (flesh color, body color, carnation)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a double-flowered cultivated variety of clove pink, with gray-green leaves and showy pink, white, or red flowers.
    "It was a work of art, four feet in diameter comprised of orchids, lilies of the valley, hyacinths, arum lilies and white carnations ."
 2. a rosy pink color.
    "sage and carnation throw pillows"

The annual flower market was going on and the soldiers put carnations in their
rifle barrels as symbols of their sympathy with the protesters.
* extracurricular :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 17:49]

Something extracurricular takes place in addition to your regular
school or work duties. Being involved in extracurricular activities in
high school — like sports or journalism — can help you get accepted to
the college of your choice.

Extracurricular is a combination of the Latin prefix extra- meaning
"on the outside" and the word curriculum, meaning "a running, course,
career." Something that is extracurricular is on the outside of your
course or career. When you get involved in an extracurricular
activity, you are going outside of what's expected. Extracurricular
can also refer to a spouse's adulterous activities, taking place
outside of their marriage commitment.

You have to say yes to extracurricular activities (or you can’t go to college), you have to say yes to going to
college (even if you have to no idea what you want to do with your life), you’re pressured to say “yes, I agree that’s
outrageous!”
* toll :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 17:52]

A toll is a payment made for something. To drive on some highways,
drivers have to pay a toll when they exit.

Toll comes from the Greek word for "tax," telos. When a fee is charged
for the privilege of driving on a road or crossing a bridge, it's
called a toll. Another kind of toll is the charge to make a long
distance telephone call. Occasionally, toll refers to a different kind
of cost — a loss of human life: the human toll of an earthquake or
war. Finally, there's the toll, or deep ringing sound, of a bell.

It took a toll on me.
* lulling :Quora:
[2017-02-08 Wed 20:10]

See lull, think "calm." It could be the noun form (like "the lull
before the storm") or the verb: one can lull someone by calming them
(as in lulling a baby to sleep with a lullaby).

The noun lull is often used in relation to a storm, but the term has a
broader meaning as well. Lull can be used to describe any temporary
period of calm or diminished activity, like the quiet time before the
lunch rush in a restaurant or the brief period of tranquility before
the doors open for a pre-Christmas sale. The word's verb form means
"to soothe or to make someone feel relaxed." When used as a verb lull
can turn deceptive, and it is often used to convey a false sense of
security.

b.frob() can be as
broken as ever, but still line coverage can read 100% thus lulling developer into false sense of security.

* corollary                                                           :Quora:
[2017-02-21 Tue 09:21]

Corollary describes a result that is the natural consequence of
something else. You could say that your weight gain is a corollary of
the recent arrival of a bakery across the street from your house.

The noun corollary describes an action's consequence, such as having
to study more, a corollary to getting a bad grade. The word is often
seen with the prepositions “to” or “of," as in “a corollary to fortune
is fame.” Math enthusiasts may already be familiar with the word
corollary, which can be used more formally to describe a new proof or
proposition that follows naturally from an established one.

Corollary: Stand next to the smartest person in the room.
* abundance                                                           :Quora:
[2017-02-21 Tue 09:23]

To have an abundance of something is to have more than you need. It's
often used to describe positive qualities, such as "an abundance of
love."

Abundance is the opposite of scarcity. An abundance of wealth is a ton
of cash. An abundance of friends sounds like a good thing, but it can
get overwhelming when it comes to scheduling time to hang out or
buying gifts. This noun comes from to us from the mid-14th century
French, via the Latin abundantia, meaning "fullness, plenty."

Persistence + Love = Abundance
* ingenious :Quora:
[2017-02-21 Tue 10:12]

Something ingenious shows creativity and inventiveness. If someone
compares you to Einstein, they're implying that you, too, are
ingenious.

Ingenious comes from the Latin words for inborn talent. It started off
meaning someone who was talented or incredibly smart, but has come to
mean inventive, or clever. If you can solve 146,392 * 27,453 in your
head, people might call you a math genius. But if you come up with a
way to turn water into fuel, you will be praised as ingenious.
Ingenious can also describe thing, like an ingenious device.

Thanks to Derek Sivers for always letting me take TOTAL credit for his ingenious rule.
* dealt :Quora:
[2017-02-21 Tue 10:13]

"Let's make a deal," a friend might say to you. That means he wants to
make an agreement on something. If you pay for the gas, for example,
he'll pay for the food. What a deal!

Ready to deal with all the meanings of the word deal?! You can deal a
deck of cards. You can make a business deal. You can strike a deal.
You can try to deal with an unfortunate situation. You can score a
deal in the bargain basement. Deal comes from the Old English dǣlan,
meaning "divide" and "participate."

A good poker player plays the hand he or she is dealt.
* peculiar :Quora:
[2017-02-22 Wed 17:55]

Something peculiar is notably unusual. If your friend starts saying
strange things you don't understand, ask her why she's suddenly become
peculiar.

Peculiar comes from the Latin peculiaris, meaning one's own, or
personal. In English, it originally meant belonging to one person,
private, like your fondness for your peculiar hairbrush. It also had
the meaning of something unlike others, special, or remarkable.
Eventually we mostly stopped using it for belongings, instead using
peculiar to mean unusual or odd.

Generally speaking, the earlier chapters describe features of Emacs
Lisp that have counterparts in many programming languages, and later
chapters describe features that are peculiar to Emacs Lisp or relate
specifically to editing.
* idiosyncrasies :Quora:
[2017-02-22 Wed 18:04]

If a person has an idiosyncrasy, he or she has a little quirk, or a
funny behavior, that makes him or her different. If you only say
goodbye in French, never in English, that would be an idiosyncrasy.

Idio seems like it means stupid, but really it is Latin for "one's
own," as an idiosyncrasy is one's own particular, usually odd,
behavior. Putting salt in your hot chocolate or needing the light on
to sleep or tapping your head while you think are all idiosyncrasies.
A machine such as a DVD player has an idiosyncrasy if you have to do
something weird to it to make it work like having to bang it on the
back left-hand side to stop it from skipping.

Dozens of Lisp implementations have been built over the years, each
with its own idiosyncrasies.
* irrespective :Quora:
[2017-02-22 Wed 18:15]

The adverb irrespective means regardless or in spite, and it is almost
always followed by the word "of." Irrespective of your desire to stay
inside on a bitterly cold day, the dog still needs to be walked.

Irrespective is a combination of the Latin roots ir, meaning not, and
respectivus, meaning having regard for. The word irrespective is
sometimes confused with its synonym regardless, giving rise in the
early 20th century to the nonstandard word irregardless, which is
considered an error by most grammarians, irrespective of how many
people use irregardless in their everyday speech.

Examples in this manual indicate printed text with ‘⊣’, irrespective
of where that text goes.

    "Cramming occurs when a company places unauthorized, misleading or deceptive charges on your phone bill, and it happens all the time."

verb
 1. completely fill (a place or container) to the point that it appears to be overflowing.
    "the ashtray by the bed was crammed with cigarette butts"
 2. study intensively over a short period of time just before an examination.
    "lectures were called off so students could cram for finals"

To cram is to crowd or stuff people or things into a limited amount of
space. You might be tempted to cram your mouth full of your mom's
chocolate chip cookies, especially if they just came out of the oven
and are still warm and gooey.

You can cram yourself with food, or cram your books onto a shelf
that's not quite big enough to hold them. A writer might cram one book
with dozens of characters, or you could cram homemade pancakes with
blueberries. Another way to cram is to study for a test all in one
session: "I haven't studied at all yet — I'll have to stay up tonight
and cram." The Old English root, crammian, means "stuff something into
something else."

After that you keep learning on the frigging as needed basis instead of
cramming textbooks to pass algorithmic interviews.
* notoriety :Quora:
[2017-02-24 Fri 20:45]

Notoriety is fame you get from doing something bad or being part of a
misfortune or scandal. Just remember: Notoriety's not al-righty.
Charles Manson earned notoriety for his grisly crimes.

In our celebrity culture, it's hard not to think that seizing your 15
minutes of fame is worth the shame of earning it through stupidity,
scandal, or evil. (See: people's motives for going on reality
television.) The rest of us can comfort ourselves with in our
boringness that most people who become notorious fade from the public
mind quickly.

There are a few ways to do this,
 but a copule are 1) working for others first and building a
 clientele, or 2) gaining notoriety on the internet through a blog,

 1. a function, quantity, or property that remains unchanged when a specified transformation is applied.
    "For example, in Euclidean geometry, the relevant invariants are embodied in quantities that are not altered by geometric transformations such as rotations, dilations, and reflections."

A friend of mine observed that people who have a CS background have a

 3. перечислять (list, enumerate, itemize, recount, recite, catalog)

 5. спеваться (rehearse)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. practice (a play, piece of music, or other work) for later public performance.
    "we were rehearsing a play"

When you rehearse, you practice something. You and your cast mates
will need to rehearse for several weeks before you'll be ready to
perform the entire two hours and forty-five minutes of the musical
"Hamilton."

A new teacher might rehearse before his first day teaching math to
ninth graders, and you'll want to rehearse before you sing the
national anthem on the field before a baseball game begins. If you're
nervous about something, like asking someone to the prom, you might
rehearse it in your mind. At the root of rehearse is the Old French
word rehercier, which means both "go over again," and "rake and turn
over the soil."

живость

noun
 1. живость (liveliness, vivacity, vitality, alacrity, agility, life)
 2. оживленность (vivacity, sparkle, glow, ginger)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. (especially in a woman) the quality of being attractively lively and animated.
    "he was struck by her vivacity, humor and charm"

If someone says you're full of vivacity, that means you have high
spirits and are full of life. Your vivacity makes you a great comedic
actor because you attack the stage with endless energy.

Vivacity comes from the Latin vīvācitāt-, meaning "life force," and
shares a root with the word vital. You may know from medical dramas
that if someone's vital signs are not good, that means he's dying. But
if he is full of vivacity, that means the opposite: he's totally
energetically fully alive! If you don't have much vivacity, don't
become a motivational speaker.

 4. заставлять отвернуться (alienate)

    "an urban environment that would alienate its inhabitants"
 2. transfer ownership of (property rights) to another person or group.
    "Consequently, unless the plaintiff alienated his ownership, he has been the owner of the case since it came into being."

When you alienate people, you make them stop liking or caring about
you. Show up at a conference of cat lovers with a sign around your
neck that says, "I hate kittens," and you'll learn firsthand what that
means.

Back in the days of Latin, before the word alien came to mean little
green men from outer space, it described something or someone that was
foreign or different or not known: an alien custom, an alien nation.
When you alienate people, you make them WISH you were an alien, or at
least that they could send you to the moon.

Challenging people when you don’t know what they
know is a surefire way to alienate any potential employer.

 2. слабоумный (idiot, moronic, imbecile, moron, mentally deficient, feeble-minded)

DEFINITION

So you’d be doing this moronic
behavior to the wrong person, the one with the final hire/no-hire
power and finish your chances then and there.
* diatribe :Quora:
[2017-02-27 Mon 18:02]
диатриба

noun
 1. диатриба (diatribe)
 2. обличительная речь (diatribe, invective, philippic)
 3. резкая обличительная речь (diatribe)
 4. уничтожающая критика (destructive criticism, diatribe)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a forceful and bitter verbal attack against someone or something.
    "a diatribe against the Roman Catholic Church"

It's pretty overwhelming when you ask your friend a seemingly
innocuous question, like "Do you like hot dogs?" and she unleashes a
diatribe about the evils of eating meat. A diatribe is an angry,
critical speech.

This noun has its roots in the Greek diatribē, "pastime or lecture,"
from diatrībein, "to waste time or wear away," combining dia-,
"thoroughly," and trībein, "to rub." So the origin of the word
diatribe is connected to both serious study and the spending or
wasting of time. With most diatribes, the speaker thinks he's well
informed and knows something the listener doesn't, while to most
listeners the diatribe is so angry and unhinged that it's just a waste
of time.

* relish :Quora:
/ˈrɛlɪʃ/
[2017-03-01 Wed 17:05]

Relish isn't just a hotdog topping. The verb relish means to enjoy
something immensely. You may relish eating the relish on your hotdog,
or you may relish taking an afternoon nap.

The word relish has been around since the 16th century and comes to us
from the French, who are pretty good at indulging and savoring. When
at a dinner party, win points with your host by sighing happily after
each bite to show just how much you relish the meal. Relish is also a
kind of spicy or savory condiment, the stuff you slather on hotdogs or
hamburgers. So if you're fickle when it comes to pickles, you might
ask them to hold the relish.

 Mary exclaimed as she ate with a relish the appetizing soup.

* modicum :Quora:

Незначительный

noun
 1. чуточка (modicum, touch, ounce, dash, smidgen, taste)
 2. очень маленькое количество (modicum, stiver)
 3. небольшие средства (modicum)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a small quantity of a particular thing, especially something considered desirable or valuable.
    "his statement had more than a modicum of truth"

If you want to describe a small amount of something, try modicum. If
you have a modicum of interest in something, you are a little bit
interested.

Modicum comes from the Latin modicus, for moderate, and modus, for
measure. We often use it to mean "any at all," as if "If you had a
modicum of sense (i.e. any sense at all), you'd be able to see that
the pencil you've spent the last five minutes looking for is tucked
behind your ear."

Hence, our book comes with a modicum of software support: a language
in which to write down programs and a program development environment
with which programs are edited like word documents and run on concrete
inputs.

garbage. The Germanic word loter, "lot" or "share," is at the root of
allotted. A plus loter form the Old French aloter, "to divide into
lots." When you're spelling allotted remember to double up the ls and
the ts.

verb
 1. hinder or impede the movement or progress of.
    "their work is hampered by lack of funds"

Anything that hampers slows progress or makes it difficult to do
something. You might think that the presence of your parents hampers
your ability to look cool.

The verb hamper is for those times when normal progress is slow but
not shut down completely. Hamper often describes travel during bad
weather, like icy conditions that could hamper holiday travel. Hamper
means "slow going." You may have heard of noun form of hamper, a

to do laundry could hamper your plans of going out and having fun.

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. strong, healthy, and full of energy.
    "And the pope, we're told, kept up his full, vigorous schedule this Christmas Eve, despite his frail health."

Anything vigorous is done with force and energy. Vigorous exercise
makes you sweat, and a vigorous denial makes someone else sweat.

Vigorous is a description for something strong or enthusiastic. It
comes from the French word vigour, meaning "liveliness, activity." An
active, physically energetic person is vigorous, and mental activities
can be vigorous too, when they require a lot of mental effort. A
vigorous argument doesn’t have to include physical wrestling; it just
might involve verbal sparring.

He may manage to find out, however, that a mathematics problem may be
as much fun as a crossword puzzle, or that vigorous mental work may be
an exercise as desirable as a fast game of tennis.

  college dormitory.

  Your accommodations while traveling, going away to school, being an
  exchange student, or doing temporary work are all called lodging or
  lodgings. A room in a hotel is one kind of lodging, and a sleeping
  bag on the floor of a tent is another kind. Lodging comes from lodge
  and its earlier form, loggen, "to set up camp," from the Old French
  root loge, "hut or cabin."

  The adverb meekly, along with the related adjective meek, has a

  pliant."

"thoroughly" plus lucidus "clear, bright." This Latin adjective is the
source of English lucid, which describes someone who thinks clearly or
something that is clear enough to understand.

verb
 1. be silent, morose, and bad-tempered out of annoyance or disappointment.
    "he was sulking over the breakup of his band"

When you are displeased by something and you let your gloomy mood
show, you're sulking. Do you want to bake another cake, or are you
going to sulk all day about the one you dropped?

When you say someone sulks, the tone of the word suggests the person
is overdoing it. You wouldn't accuse a widow of sulking at her
husband's funeral, because she has a good reason to be sad and gloomy.
Instead of sulking because you messed up your tuba solo during the
concert, why not put your energy into practice? Or switch to violin.

Annoyed when Tezcatlipoca stole his wife Xochiquetzal, he sulked and
refused to allow any rain to fall, so there was a terrible drought.

    "we give to charity because it appeases our guilt"

Appease means to make or preserve peace with a nation, group, or
person by giving in to their demands, or to relieve a problem, as in
"the cold drink appeased his thirst."

Appease often implies abandoning your moral principles to satisfy the
demands of someone who is greedy for power: think of British Prime
Minister Chamberlain's attempt to appease the Nazis at Munich. The
verb appease comes from the Old French apaisier, "to pacify, make
peace, or be reconciled," from the phrase "a paisier," which combines
a-, or "to," and pais, "peace," from the Latin pax.

The Aztecs believed that they had to sacrifice human victims
to appease the sun god, otherwise he would not rise in the

Ужасный

adjective
 1. ужасный (terrible, horrible, awful, appalling, dreadful, gruesome)
 2. отвратительный (disgusting, hideous, heinous, abominable, revolting, gruesome)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. causing repulsion or horror; grisly.
    "a most gruesome murder"

Gothic novels, horror movies, and crime dramas don't shy away from
showing gruesome scenes of death, pictures that inspire fright and
repulsion. Synonyms include "ghastly," "grisly," "loathsome," and
"macabre."

Once upon a time, English contained a variety of words related to
gruesome. The verb grue meant "to shudder," just as its Middle Dutch
source gruwen did. Grueful and grueing also conveyed the sense of
shivering with horror and disgust. All of these variations have been
lost leaving us only with gruesome. Texting while driving has caused
many gruesome accidents that you might not want to hear the gruesome
details of. Although if you like gruesome movies, you might want to
know.

The sacrifices themselves were famously gruesome.

 2. кровопролитный (sanguinary, slaughterous, sanguineous, gory, internecine)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. involving or showing violence and bloodshed.
    "a gory horror film"

Use the word gory to describe something that features a lot of
bloodshed and violence, like a horror movie in which victims are axed
to death by a madman. Some people love gory movies like that, and
others refuse to watch them.

Something that is gory often involves both violence and bloodshed, but
it can also describe something that is merely blood, like the gory
photographs depicting a root canal procedure in a dental assistant
textbook. Gory can describe unpleasant, embarrassing things, like
saying of your brother’s bad behavior over the holidays, “I’ll spare
you the gory details about his meltdown at the family Christmas
party.”

By the end of the Aztecs’ heyday, when the Spaniards arrived (bringing
their own brand of gruesomeness), the sun cult had escalated to a gory

Владеющий

verb
 1. владеть (own, possess, hold, master, wield, command)
 2. иметь в руках (wield)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. hold and use (a weapon or tool).
    "a masked raider wielding a handgun"

If you wield a tool or a weapon, you handle it effectively. Picture a
gallant knight wielding a sword or a skillful chef wielding a whisk.

You don't just have to wield something physical; you can also wield or
exert influence or authority. Wield is frequently followed by the word
power. If you were a king, you could wield great power in your kingdom
— exerting your influence over everything from food rations to castle
upkeep. As it is, though, you might just wield power over your pet
goldfish. Note: wield follows the i before e, except after c spelling
rule.

* lichens :Quora:
[2017-03-11 Sat 13:10]
Лишайники

noun
 1. лишайник (lichen, moss)
 2. лишай (lichen, herpes, tetter, dartre)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. a simple slow-growing plant that typically forms a low crustlike, leaflike, or branching growth on rocks, walls, and trees.
    "A profusion of mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns cover the woodland floor and festoon tree trunks and branches."
 2. a skin disease in which small pimples or bumps occur close together.
    "The white buccal lesions of oral lichen planus may necessitate biopsy to exclude leukoplakia, candidiasis, and secondary syphilis."

Have you ever walked through the woods and seen a crusty-looking shelf
growing out of a tree? That is actually a lichen, a complex organism
comprised of a fungus and its partner algae, the two parts
interweaving to form one.

The word lichen appeared around 1600, and was drawn from the Greek
leikhēn, meaning "what eats around itself." This is a good meaning for
what the word represents, as lichen is comprised of fungus cells that
literally surround the algae cells to form a mutualistic bond. Because
of the crusty look of a lichen, the name has also been given to a
number of skin diseases that present the same patchy look as the
fungus-algae.

This proverb refers to what is well known about mosses and lichens
- that they are slow-growing organisms that don't thrive on
disturbance.

 7. пышно разрастаться (thrive)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. (of a child, animal, or plant) grow or develop well or vigorously.
    "the new baby thrived"

To thrive is to do well or flourish. If your new cookie delivery
business thrives, you'll be rolling in dough — not literally, of
course.

The verb thrive means to flourish or grow vigorously, and it can be
applied to something like a business or to something or someone's
actual health. Plants can thrive in a greenhouse, and children can
thrive if they eat well and exercise. Thriving can also be used more
figuratively — "The women thrived on gossip; they loved knowing who
was dating or divorcing whom."

Something abiding sticks around, lasting a long time. Abiding is
usually used with feelings and memories — as in your abiding love for
Elmo.

Abiding comes from the Old English abidan, gebidan meaning "remain,
wait, delay, remain behind." It's a word that's typically used to
describe a feeling or memory that remains behind or lingers in your
mind a while. You can have an abiding faith in God, or an abiding
respect for war veterans or an abiding passion. "Law-abiding citizens"
are those people who stick strictly to the law. They always use the
crosswalk and pay their taxes on time.

 3. глубокое возмущение (wrath, strong feelings, strong feeling)

DEFINITION

noun

    "he hid his pipe for fear of incurring his father's wrath"

someone: Noah saw the flood as a sign of the wrath of God.

Wrath is also used figuratively of things that behave in a violent
way: Earthquakes are the wrath of the sea. This noun and the
corresponding adjective wrathful are in literary use but are formal or
old-fashioned words, that crop up in fantasy fiction or movies set in
prehistoric times.

 2. учебный судебный процесс (moot)

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. subject to debate, dispute, or uncertainty, and typically not admitting of a final decision.
    "whether the temperature rise was mainly due to the greenhouse effect was a moot point"

noun
 1. an assembly held for debate, especially in Anglo-Saxon and medieval times.
    "Even if, as some have supposed, the manor court, or hall moot , had Anglo-Saxon forebears, it was an institution that must have changed out of all recognition after 1100."
 2. a mock trial set up to examine a hypothetical case as an academic exercise.
    "The last time I was there, nearly a decade ago, I was a law student competing in the Jessup International Law moot ."

verb
 1. raise (a question or topic) for discussion; suggest (an idea or possibility).
    "Sylvia needed a vacation, and a trip to Ireland had been mooted"

When a point is moot, it's too trivial to think about. If your
basketball team loses by 40 points, the bad call by the official in
the first quarter is moot: it isn't important.

Though moot can mean to debate endlessly without any clear decision or
to think about something carefully, it most often describes ideas and
arguments that don't really matter. If your plane is crashing, whether
or not your socks match is a moot point. When someone accuses you of
making a moot point, he's basically saying, "Come on! Let's talk about
what's important." As with so many things, people don't always agree
on what's moot and what's not.

That's a moot point however, Franklin and Poor Richard being one and
the same.

Невзгоды

noun
 1. несчастья (misery, adversity, ill)
 2. напасти (adversity)
 3. бедствия (adversity)
 4. неблагоприятная обстановка (adversity)
 5. превратности судьбы (vicissitudes of life, vicissitudes of fate, adversity, ups and downs, tricks of fortune, transmutations of fortune)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. difficulties; misfortune.
    "resilience in the face of adversity"

When circumstances or situations work against you, you face adversity.
Refugees from war-torn countries encounter terrible adversity.

Adversity, a noun which has been part of the English language for over
800 years, comes from the Latin adversus, literally "turned against,"
and figuratively "hostile or unfavorable." When things seem against
you — circumstances or a stoke of bad luck — you are facing adversity.
Sometimes people use a form of the phrase "turning adversity into
opportunity." This refers to the ability some people or companies have
to take a bad situation and make it into a successful one.

изобилие

noun
 1. изобилие (abundance, plenty, galore, fertility, wealth, exuberance)
 2. богатство (wealth, riches, richness, rich, fortune, exuberance)
 3. избыток (excess, surplus, abundance, glut, overflow, exuberance)

DEFINITION

noun
 1. the quality of being full of energy, excitement, and cheerfulness; ebullience.
    "a sense of youthful exuberance"

Use exuberance to describe joyful enthusiasm and liveliness. You
appreciate the natural exuberance of small children, but you prefer to
enjoy it from a distance.

The noun exuberance comes from the adjective exuberant, which itself
came from a Latin word that originally described an overflowing supply
of milk from the udder of a cow or goat! The word still means
"overflowing," not with milk but with joy and enthusiasm. After your
winning home run, the fans ran onto the field and, in their
exuberance, carried you off on their shoulders . . . before you
touched home plate.

Richard Dawkins elucidates the wonders of the natural world
to all ages with his inimitable clarity and exuberance in a
text that will enlighten and inform for generations to come.

* appraise :Quora:
[2017-03-20 Mon 18:03]
Оценивать

verb
 1. оценивать (evaluate, appreciate, estimate, assess, rate, appraise)
 2. расценивать (appraise, rate, cost)

DEFINITION

verb
 1. assess the value or quality of.
    "she stealthily appraised him in a pocket mirror"

When you buy a house someone will need to appraise its value before
you can get a mortgage. To appraise something is to figure out its
worth in the marketplace, on the field, or in the world of ideas.

To appraise the value of a friendship is difficult, but to appraise
the value of your grandfather’s pocket watch — just go to the pawn
shop. The verb appraise comes from the Late Latin word appretiare,
which means “value” or “estimate.” You can appraise your chances of
marrying royalty, which are probably slim. You can also appraise the
value of a quarterback on your fantasy football team by looking at the
statistics for his completed passes.

The word comes from its use in everyday language, “to ascertain the
value or amount of; to appraise”, according to ‘Webster’s New
Collegiate Dictionary’.

 4. выполнять приказание (obey)

DEFINITION

verb

    "I always obey my father"

When you obey, you follow someone's rules or instructions. In the old
days, all of a monarchy's citizens were expected to obey the commands
of their king or queen.

You might be expected to obey the rules your strict parents lay down,
or to obey the guidelines of a group or club you belong to. Religious
Christians obey God, and soldiers obey the direct orders their
commanding officers give them. To obey is to be obedient, and both
words come from the Latin obedire, which literally means "listen to,"
but is used to mean "pay attention to."

The function definition is a set of instructions that a computer will
obey.

    "he embarked for India in 1817"

When you embark on something, you are starting it — and it's exciting.
You might embark on a new career or embark on a trip to the Galapagos
Islands. You wouldn't embark on a trip to the grocery store.

The verb embark can be used specifically to refer to boarding a ship
for a journey. When used for general travel, the verb embark often
implies a longer journey: "She embarked on a trip around the world."
Besides, physical journeys, embark can be used to mean to start other
kinds of journeys as well. You might embark on a spiritual journey or
embark on the path to enlightenment. Pack well.

good thing to decide before embarking.

DEFINITION

adjective
 1. more than is necessary, normal, or desirable; immoderate.
    "he was drinking excessive amounts of brandy"

Excessive means beyond what is typical or normal. When something is
excessive, there's way too much.

Excessive refers to something that is extra — usually in a negative
way. A 90-second drum solo in a two-minute song is excessive. Getting
down on your knees and kissing someone's feet to thank them for a
favor is excessive, unless they gave you their firstborn. Often this
means something that exceeds the bounds of good taste, or is
extravagant and inappropriately expensive. You should dress up for
dinner, but wearing a ball gown to a diner is excessive.

  The noun hatred means to feel a strong emotional dislike toward
  something or someone. You feel hatred of people who have done terrible
  things to you, or books about too-perfect teens.

  Hatred comes from Old English hete, which means "hate," plus the
  suffix red (ræden), which means "the condition of." If you find after
  twenty years of marriage you no longer like your husband, you may be
  able to work it out. If you feel hatred towards him, your differences
  may be irreconcilable.

* thicket :Quora:
  [2017-03-25 Sat 21:42]

  A thicket refers to a dense growth of bushes or trees — what you try
  to avoid by tending to the plants in your backyard.

  The word thicket comes from the word thick, which means close together
  or dense. If you are "thick as thieves," then you are close friends. A
  thicket is a growth of trees, bushes, or shrubbery that is very close
  together, often making it difficult for people to walk through or for
  Red Riding Hood to find her way out of to Grandmother's.

  Duncan gathered wood and built a fire in the lee of a
  thorn-bush thicket.
* apex :Quora:
  [2017-04-04 Tue 14:20]

  When there's no mountain left to climb and nothing but blue sky
  above, you know you've reached the highest peak — the apex.

  Apex can mean the highest point in a literal sense, like climbing to
  the apex of the Eiffel Tower for a fabulous view of Paris. It also
  can be used to mean the highest point in a figurative sense. An
  actor who wins an Oscar can say she's reached the apex of her
  career. If you're describing more than one high point, you could add
  an -es to form the plural apexes, but apices would also be correct.
  And if you're a botanist, you'd probably use apex to describe the
  tip of a flower or leaf.

  If there are any weight vectors that get the right answer for all
  cases, they lie in a hyper-cone with its apex at the origin.

* nascent :Quora:
  [2017-04-04 Tue 14:54]

  Nascent describes the birth or beginning of something, for example a
  civilization, a trend, an idea, or an action. It can also imply a
  future promise, like the nascent government of a new country.

  You’re in the future looking back at the first time you learned the
  definition of the word nascent. Your nascent efforts to use the word
  felt awkward, but you quickly felt comfortable with it, especially
  after you learned how to pronounce it: “NAY-sent.” Now you use the
  word all the time: "the nascent hopes of your little sister;" your
  "nascent hula hooping gang;" and "a nascent confidence in your
  vocabulary."

* setback :Quora:
  [2017-04-04 Tue 14:57]

  A setback is an event that makes you lose progress or keeps you from
  gaining ground. If you're knitting a sweater, dropping a bunch of
  stitches would be a big setback.

  If warring countries are negotiating a treaty, a sudden resurgence
  of fighting would be a huge setback for their peace plan. And if
  you're trying to finish baking in time for you friend's birthday
  party, knocking the frosted cake onto the floor would also be a
  setback. Setbacks are always frustrating — unless you're talking
  about the kind of setback that's defined as "a building's distance
  from the street."

  even such simple functions as XOR was a significant setback to the
  nascent neural network

* boasts :Quora:
  [2017-04-09 Sun 18:11]

  When you boast you are bragging about yourself and your
  accomplishments (or maybe those of your family), often to the
  boredom and annoyance of your audience.

  Used as either a noun or a verb, boast usually suggests
  exaggeration, vanity, or pride. Along those lines, English poet Sir
  Thomas Overbury, who died in 1613, once said, "The man who has
  nothing to boast of but his illustrious ancestry is like the potato
  — the best part underground." However, the word can also be used in
  a positive way: a town can boast a new library, or a school can
  boast a high graduation rate.

  In comparison, MATLAB boasts a large number of additional toolboxes,
  notably Simulink, whereas NumPy is intrinsically integrated with
  Python, a more modern and complete programming language.

* contiguous :Quora:
  [2017-04-09 Sun 18:27]

  Use the adjective contiguous when you want to describe one thing
  touching another thing, or next to it but not actually touching.

  Things that are contiguous are near or next to but not actually
  touching and yet they are also defined as "touching, sharing a
  border." You can use this adjective to describe people or things
  related to and nearby others. It comes from the Latin word
  contiguus, which means pretty much the same thing, "bordering upon."
  Because the word has two meanings that are very similar but not
  always the same it can be a bit confusing. This is an example of
  what's called "semantic ambiguity," when something can mean more
  than one thing or a word or phrase is not precise.

  These circumstances originate from the fact that NumPy's arrays must
  be views on contiguous memory buffers.

* revenue                                                             :Quora:
[2017-04-24 Mon 17:19]

Revenue is money earned by a business, or income received by the
government from taxes. The government is always interested in dreaming
up new sources of revenue, and so is the average head of a company
unless she doesn't want to be the head anymore.

Revenue is from a French word meaning "to return or come back," and
dollar returns are always a welcome thing. Declining advertising
revenue will doom your website, no matter how great it is. If your
lemonade stand is not making a profit, you might consider lowering
costs. Maybe you could get cheaper lemonade mix? Or you might look for
more creative and exciting ways to increase revenue––like raiding the
pantry for cookies you can sell as well.

Since I started the business in early 2015, two years ago,
we’ve had $26 million in revenues and $3.6 million in
profits.
* excess :Quora:
[2017-04-24 Mon 17:22]

Excess is too much of something, like big-time overindulgence. Eating
to excess makes your stomach hurt, and spending to excess means you
can't pay your credit card bills.

Excess comes from the Latin word excessus meaning, "go out, going
beyond the bounds of reason," like eating and spending in excess. (Not
so reasonable.) Although it spends most of its time as a noun, it can
also be an adjective to describe "more than is required or needed,"
like when excess water spills over the top of the bathtub, or those
excess pounds spill over the top of your jeans.

A) Some people have a huge excess of “Something”: empty car
seats (Uber), empty rooms (Airbnb), excess knowledge (a
newsletter or course you can start), etc.
* cusp :Quora:
[2017-04-25 Tue 20:51]

A cusp in geometry is the point where two curves meet. It's a kind of
transition. If you're on the cusp of manhood, you’re not quite grown
up, but you’re definitely not a little boy anymore either.

The word comes from Latin cuspis, "point." You'll see lots of cusps in
Gothic churches — a point where two arches meet, or where decorative
curves meet to form a point. The little points that stick out on the
surface of your teeth that are flat on top — the ones you use for
grinding — are also called cusps. Those teeth right behind your canine
teeth but before your molars have two cusps, and they're called
bicuspids.

Ooh, I’m on this cusp.
* cocky :Quora:
[2017-04-25 Tue 20:53]

Cocky means "overly self-confident," like a cocky announcement at the
beginning of the season that your soccer team will win the
championship without even trying.

Cocky originally meant "lecherous," or lustful, but evolved to mean
"arrogantly pert" in the 1700s. Cocky people don't usually stop at
bragging about themselves — they'll cut you in line at the grocery
store, because they think they are too important to wait. Synonyms for
cocky are conceited, egotistical, and the phrase "full of
himself/herself."

I’m not as confident and cocky as I was in my 20’s.
* coarse :Quora:
[2017-04-25 Tue 20:55]

Coarse can mean rough to the touch or vulgar. It's good to have coarse
sand paper, but not good to have coarse manners.

Do you lick your dinner plate, wipe your nose on your sleeve, and
generally behave like an oaf? No, of course not. You're the kind of
person who reads online dictionaries. But if you did do any of things,
you'd be coarse — that is, unrefined, boorish, and downright vulgar.
Coarse can apply to a wide variety of things other than behavior. If
something is of poor quality, cheap and inferior, it's considered
coarse.

Work wise, I get a lot less
recruitment calls or approaches than I used to, but I think
that is in no small part to being coarse with recruiters and
not being on LinkedIn (not staying around for post-Brexit
racism thank you very much - so I left) rather than being
definitively due to age.
* judicious :Quora:
[2017-04-29 Sat 17:14]

If you're judicious, you've got a good head on your shoulders and make
good decisions. Humpty Dumpty's decision to sit on a wall? NOT
judicious.

As its sound implies, judicious comes from the same Latin word from
which we get judge and judiciary, and not surprisingly a judicious
decision is one that only comes after all sides have been weighed up
and opposing points of view taken into consideration. Judicious
decisions are never split-second decisions.

* herrings :Quora:
[2017-04-29 Sat 17:14]

A herring is a small, silver fish. Most herring that's caught for food
is prepared by being smoked, salted, or pickled.

The majority of herring is caught in the Atlantic, though the fish is
found in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. Because
it's very high in the famously healthy Omega-3 fats, herring is
considered a healthful fish for people to eat. Herrings is also used
as bait for catching larger fish. Although the source of the word
herring is uncertain, many experts see a link to the Old English har,
or "gray."

as sea gulls. Gulls are found in every continent, including
Antarctica.

The noun gull has two very distinct definitions. Gulls are shore
birds, of course, but lesser-used meaning of the word is "a person who
is easy to fool." Your little brother might be a gull if you can trick
him into doing your chores along with his own. You may know the
related word gullible, which describes a willingness to believe
anything, without questioning whether it is true.

* shear :Quora:

A shear is a cutting implement that looks like a long pair of
scissors. Also like scissors, this form of the noun is usually plural.
You can cut metal, prune a tree, or cut up a chicken with shears.

In farming, when you remove wool from a sheep, goat, or even a llama,
you shear the animal. Most farmers shear their sheep once a year, but
the timing varies from farm to farm. The verb shear also means to
cause to break off or come apart with a cutting force. The wind during
a storm can blow hard enough to shear the tiles off a roof.

* occlusion :Quora:
[2017-04-29 Sat 17:18]

Occlusion is either the act of blocking something or a specific
blockage. There can be occlusions blocking the street or your
arteries. When dentists say occlusion, they’re talking about what your
teeth look like when your mouth is closed.

An occlusion blocks anything that flows, like cars, people, water, or
blood. You can say there's occlusion if a pipe is clogged. If you find
out a golf ball was in the pipe, the ball was an occlusion. This word
applies to things that block and the act of blocking. People have
heart attacks when there's occlusion in their arteries. An overturned
truck would be an occlusion on the highway. Occlusions are in the way.

* horrendously :Quora:

  Bad luck, an injury, a mistake, an unfortunate outfit, or a crime —
  anything can be called horrendous if it causes such dread or fear that
  you can barely even think about it.

  If you’ve ever encountered something horrendous, you won’t be
  surprised to learn that the word traces back to the Latin word
  horrere, meaning "to bristle with fear, shudder." That’s a good way to
  think about horrendous things — they cause you to shudder. You can use
  the word to describe any type of thing — people, ideas, actions, and
  so on — but save it for those things that are not merely bad but
  instead are truly horrifying.

  And even if we did know what program to write, it might be
  that it was a horrendously complicated program.
* stark :Quora:
  [2017-05-02 Tue 16:26]

  Stark means "complete or extreme," like the stark contrast between
  your music taste — punk and weird metal — and your mom's, with all her
  1950's doo-wop favorites.

  In describing a place, stark means "providing no shelter or
  sustenance." A barren desert or a room with no furniture or curtains
  is stark. It can also mean "severe, stern, or austere," like the
  stark beauty of the rocky cliffs in the west of Ireland. Stark can
  also be used to mean "totally." If you are called stark, raving mad,
  there's no question about it: you are acting completely crazy.

  And now massive amounts for computation are cheaper that paying
  someone to write a program for a specific task, so we can afford big
  complicated machine learning programs to produce these stark task
  specific systems for us.
* plausible :Quora:
  [2017-05-02 Tue 16:38]

  If something is plausible, it's reasonable or believable. Things that
  are plausible could easily happen. A woman becoming President is very
  plausible. A giraffe becoming President is not.

  Plausible things are not far-fetched at all. Things in fantasy
  stories — such as wizards, dragons, and unicorns — are not
  plausible. On the other hand, some things in science fiction stories
  might be plausible: who knows where spaceships will eventually go?
  If something really seems like it could happen, then it's plausible.
  One of the many tricky parts of life is figuring out what's
  plausible and what's not.

  So its, its errors tell you a lot about how it's doing it and
  they're very plausible errors.

  2. посещение (visit, attendance)
  3. присутствие (presence, attendance)
  4. обслуживание (service, maintenance, handling, attendance)
  5. аудитория (audience, classroom, auditorium, auditory, lecture hall, attendance)
  6. услуги (attendance)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. the action or state of going regularly to or being present at a place or event.
     "my attendance at church was very irregular"


  Attendance has to do with being present at something, like work or
  school. If you never miss a day, you have perfect attendance.

  The concept of attendance has to do with showing up: if you show up
  for school, then your attendance is not in question. When people
  miss school or work, they usually need a note from a doctor,
  explaining why they weren't in attendance. We can also say "The
  attendance was 100" if 100 people showed up to a meeting. If only
  three people out of 100 showed up though, you'd say, "Wow.
  Attendance was terrible."

  His attendance was poor at best and he dropped out after his junior
  year.

  1. делать лучше, чем другой (outperform)

  DEFINITION

  verb
  1. perform better than.
     "an experienced employee will outperform the novice"


  To outperform is to accomplish something in a better or more
  impressive way that someone else. In a marathon, the younger runners
  usually outperform the very oldest ones.

  Whenever you surpass or beat the record of another person, you can
  say you outperform them. Experienced workers frequently outperform
  newer employees, and pundits like to worry aloud about students in
  other countries who outperform American kids on standardized tests.
  You can also say that an investment that makes more money

  adjective
  1. бестелесный (incorporeal, bodiless, immaterial, unsubstantial, unbodied)
  2. бесплотный (incorporeal, ethereal, discarnate, aethereal, unbodied)
  3. невещественный (immaterial, incorporeal, unsubstantial)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. not composed of matter; having no material existence.
     "ghostly presences and incorporeal beings"


  Something that has no material form or physical substance can be
  described as incorporeal. If you believe in spirits or ghosts that
  can't be touched or seen but only felt, then you believe in the
  incorporeal.

  Incorporeal comes from a combination of the Latin root words in-
  meaning "not" and corpus meaning "body." Combined they form
  incorporeus, meaning "without body," which is precisely what
  something incorporeal is. A haunted house is plagued by incorporeal,
  or immaterial spirits. You don't see them, but they are there,
  rattling windows, slamming doors, scaring the living daylights out
  of you.

  /ˌɛm pəˈθɛt ɪk/

  An empathetic person is someone who can share another person's
  feelings. If you tell an empathetic person that your heart is
  broken, she might touch her own heart and gaze at you sadly through
  moist eyes.

  Empathetic is a recent term; it comes from empathy, which was coined
  by the German philosopher Rudolf Lotze in 1858. Lotze believed that
  when you look at a work of art, you project your own sensibilities
  onto it. So if you feel sad when you see a painting of a woman
  weeping over a dying lover, that's because you can imagine what it's
  like to lose someone you love. To make the word, Lotze turned to the
  ancient Greek empatheia, which means "passion."

  3. легко поддающийся обработке (tractable)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. (of a person or animal) easy to control or influence.
     "tractable dogs that have had some obedience training"


  If your little brother quietly obeys your instructions and waits for
  you at the food court while you and your friends wander around the
  mall, he's probably a tractable child, meaning he's obedient,
  flexible, and responds well to directions.

  Note the similarity between tractable and tractor. Both come from
  the Latin word tractare, which originally meant "to drag about." You
  can think of a tractable person as someone who can be dragged about
  easily, like a plow being dragged by a tractor.

  So with a generative model like this, if you get to observe what it
  produces, and you now try to infer what the hidden state was, in
  general that's very hard, but there's two types of hidden state

  You should probably postpone dinner if your date's cold is
  contagious — that means it's easily spread and likely to get you
  sick.

  Contagious actually evolved from contagio, the Latin phrase for
  “contact." Those smart ancient Romans — they figured out that the
  sick and contagious can pass on their plague to those they touch or
  get close to. So the word contagious usually sends people running.
  But let’s not forget that a smile or good deed can be just as

  3. неразумный (irrational, unwise, silly, subhuman, inadvisable, insensate)
  4. бессмысленный (nonsensical, senseless, meaningless, pointless, mindless, insensate)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. lacking physical sensation.
     "a patient who was permanently unconscious and insensate"


  Insensate is a word to describe something without feelings or
  consciousness. Cars, computers, and stuffed animals are all
  insensate (though some of us occasionally project thoughts and
  personalities onto them).

  Insensate can also describe individuals who seem to lack the
  characteristically human emotions of kindness and generosity. A
  person who tears a stuffed animal out of the hands of a young child
  might be described as insensate. Another meaning of insensate is
  “lacking intelligence.” In short, insensate, in any sense of the
  word, is usually something that you don’t want to be.

  DEFINITION

  1. a spoken word, statement, or vocal sound.
     "His bizarre word rhythm and gleeful disregard for punctuation makes even his most banal utterances sound dramatic."


  An utterance is a bit of spoken language. It could be anything from
  "Ugh!" to a full sentence.

  To utter means "to say." So when you're saying something, you're
  making utterances. Saying "24" in math class is an utterance. A
  police officer yelling "Stop!" is an utterance. Saying "Good boy!"
  to your dog is an utterance. Even a long speech by the President is
  an utterance. If you can't hear it, it's not an utterance.

  So now let's consider how much information a hidden Markov model can
  convey to the second half of an utterance it produces from the first
  half.

* intrinsic :Quora:
  [2017-05-08 Mon 10:15]

  The intrinsic qualities of something have to do with its nature. An
  intrinsic quality of dogs is that they're loyal.

  Anything intrinsic comes from within. Doing a job for only money is
  not intrinsic. Doing a job because you love it is intrinsic; the
  motivation comes from within. It's good to treat people as having
  intrinsic value. If you like someone for intrinsic reasons, then you
  have no other motivation. The opposite of intrinsic is extrinsic,
  for things that come from the outside instead of from the inside.

  That is the dynamics and the production of observations from the
  underlying state both involve intrinsic noise.

  4. неприятель (enemy, adversary)
  5. оппонент (opponent, adversary, enemy, opposer, contradictor)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. one's opponent in a contest, conflict, or dispute.
     "Davis beat his old adversary in the quarterfinals"


  An adversary is someone who fights against or opposes another. In
  tennis, you stand across the net from your adversary.

  Adversary as in "enemy" or "opponent" is related to the words
  adversarial, or hostile, or adverse, meaning against or contrary.
  The Adversary is a specific reference to Satan, or the Devil. The
  word adversary is from Middle English adversarie, from Latin
  adversarius, from adversus "against."

  If you're up against a much smarter adversary, you probably can't

  2. провести (outwit, catch, hoodwink, best, entrap)

  DEFINITION

  verb
  1. deceive or defeat by greater ingenuity.
     "Ray had outwitted many an opponent"


  Use the verb outwit to describe using your brain to beat an
  opponent, like outwitting someone by figuring out the answer to a
  difficult riddle.

  Wit comes from the Old English word witan, which means "to know." So
  someone who outwits another person knows more — or at least knows
  more than the person thought. You can outwit someone with clever
  words, or with craftiness on the playing field. An unexpected
  strategy can help one side outwit the other on the battlefield.

  If you're up against a much smarter adversary, you probably can't
  outwit them, so it might be a good idea just to behave randomly.

     "thousands of antiques hoarded by a compulsive collector"


  To hoard is to save something (or lots of things) for future use.
  Squirrels hoard nuts for the winter. Old ladies tend to hoard canned
  food and used plastic bags.

  People have been using the word hoard for both "to hide" and
  "treasure" for centuries; as both a verb and as a noun. Some hoard
  valuables, such as money, jewelry, and family antiques. Others build
  up a hoard, or cache, of things that aren't worth money but are
  important to them — like comic books or match books.

* plausibility :Quora:
  [2017-05-08 Mon 21:30]

  Something's plausibility is how likely it is to be true. You might,
  for example, question the plausibility of your brother's story about
  seeing a UFO land in the back yard.

  The noun plausibility means "likelihood" or "believability." You're
  most likely to come across the word in a negative or questioning
  context, as when someone doubts the plausibility of an action
  movie's plot or questions the plausibility of a debater's claims and
  arguments. If you aren't sure you believe something, you'll question
  its plausibility. The Latin root is plausibilis, "deserving applause
  or acceptable."

  1. a bowl for washing, typically attached to a wall and having faucets connected to a water supply; a washbasin.
     "‘I liked the traditional idea of washing with a basin and ewer,’ he reflects."
  2. a wide, round open container, especially one used for holding liquid.
     "People saw them turn over her basins of food and all the tofu products, eggs and all, splashed on the ground."
  3. a natural depression on the earth's surface, typically containing water.
     "the Indian Ocean basin"


  A basin is a container that holds water and is used for washing, but
  you probably just call it your bathroom sink.

  You can think of basinas something shaped like a bowl. If you're
  going for an old-fashioned ring, say "wash basin." If you’re in
  England, you might use a basin for cooking. The word basin also has
  various geological senses, particularly a depression in the ground
  or ocean floor. A basin is also the spot where a river drains — like
  the famed Mississippi River Basin. That’s one big bowl!

  So we're going a learn blue basin of attraction and a pink basin of

  [2017-05-09 Tue 10:05]

  To bound is to jump or hop — usually as you run. Bound can also mean
  to go or to plan to go, especially to a certain destination, as in
  being bound for New York or homeward-bound.

  Superman can "leap tall buildings in a single bound," but the word
  bound is usually about boundaries. When you're playing soccer or
  football, the ball goes "out of bounds." Someone can also be bound
  with rope — tied up. Commitments are another kind of tie. When you
  get married, you're bound to your partner. If you make a promise,
  you're bound to your word. On a less pleasant note, if you're
  constipated, you're bound up.

  And so whenever your trying to use a recurrent neural network to
  learn attractors like this, you're bound to get vanishing or
  exploding gradients.

  verb
  1. escape or avoid, especially by cleverness or trickery.
     "friends helped him to evade capture for a time"

  When you evade something, you escape it. You could evade a police
  chase by slipping into a secret alley, or you could evade your
  mother's questions about the missing cookies by slipping into
  another topic.

  Other things people like to evade? Death. Taxes. Creepy
  ex-boyfriends. The verb evade comes from Latin roots ex ("away) and
  vadere ("to walk"), meaning literally "to walk away or to escape."
  Definitely what you want to do with creepy ex-boyfriends.

  The third method really kind of evades the problem.

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. (in gambling) an independent party with whom each of those who
     make a wager deposits the money or counters wagered.

     "The statute permits a gambling ‘loser’ or other permitted
     plaintiff to recover from ‘a winner, depositary or stakeholder ’
     money lost by a ‘wager, bet or stake.’"
     
  2. a person with an interest or concern in something, especially a
     business.

     "The body should also have regional networks in order to
     accommodate greater interests among stakeholders ."


  A stakeholder is a person interested in a company. If you become CEO
  of a big company, you'll have to keep the interests of every
  stakeholder in mind, from the employees to the customers to the
  investors, whenever you make decisions.

  Supposedly people used to gamble by putting their money on a wooden
  stake, and a person called a stakeholder who wasn't involved in the
  betting would supervise to make sure everything was fair. No one
  uses wooden stakes anymore, but we still call the person who holds
  the money and monitors the betting the stakeholder, and people often
  use stake to mean "risk," or "investment." That's why someone who is
  invested in a business is also called a stakeholder.

  Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide
  stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or
  service under test.[1] Software testing can also provide an
  objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to
  appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation.

  1. вежливость (courtesy, politeness, civility, comity, urbanity, decency)
  2. учтивость (courtesy, politeness, urbanity, affability, delicacy, suavity)
  3. обходительность (courtesy, complaisance, suavity)
  4. этикет (etiquette, decorum, courtesy, form)
  5. правила вежливости (courtesy)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. the showing of politeness in one's attitude and behavior toward others.
     "he had been treated with a degree of courtesy not far short of deference"

  A courtesy is a polite remark or respectful act. Complain about a
  bad meal, and you might get kicked out. But the common courtesy is
  usually an apology from the manager and, if you're lucky, a free
  dinner.

  Courtesy is all about using your good manners, which is why it
  shares roots with the word courteous. Holding the door open for
  someone, writing a thank-you note for a gift, and letting the
  pregnant lady have the last seat on the bus are all courtesies that
  would make your parents proud. And if something is kindly presented
  to you free of charge, the gift-giver may say it's "courtesy of"
  someone special.

  The proper use of a cover letter can be a gesture of personal
  courtesy which lends dignity and weight to the related transaction.

  When you tread on the earth, you walk on it. The next time your pal
  thinks you have it too easy, you might ask him, “Why don’t you tread
  in my shoes for a day?”

  Tread usually implies stepping with force, but it can also simply
  mean placing your feet, one after the other, on the ground. You
  might try to tread lightly on the moss in the backyard so you don't
  damage it. Tread is also a noun that means the mark that a tire
  leaves on the ground, or the actual grooves on the tire. You might
  be relieved that the tread marks at the crime scene didn't match
  your brother's truck after all.

  [2017-05-24 Wed 14:42]

  To hustle something means to hurriedly push it along. If you
  overslept, you'll have to hustle out of the house to get to work on
  time.

  Hustle comes from the Dutch word for "shake" or "toss." As a noun, a
  hustle is a busy, hurried scene, like the hustle of the subway at
  rush hour. We also call the act of swindling a hustle, because it
  happens so fast. As a verb, hustle can either mean to swindle
  someone or to hurry them, or to work hard. You can hustle someone
  out the door. If you hustle, you can earn good tips as a waiter.

  'When we came out of the cinema I thought we were going to get a
  car, but no, he hustled us into a cab, and a very smelly one at
  that.

    "she longed for a little more excitement"

  A longing is a strong feeling of need or desire for someone or
  something. If you're stuck in detention and all of your friends are
  outside enjoying a sunny day, you might be looking out the window
  with longing.

  A longing describes an unfulfilled desire. The days might feel long
  as long as you are longing to see someone you love, if that person
  is far away. You might be longing for your mother's home-made
  chicken soup, if you are sick and far from home. Or perhaps you are
  a pregnant woman, wide awake and longing for pickles and ice-cream
  at four in the morning. Let's hope there's a twenty-four hour deli
  open somewhere to help satisfy your longing.

  Anyway, it took us hours and hours, because the poor horse was

  myself, and longing for a drink.

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. the action of detaining someone or the state of being detained in official custody, especially as a political prisoner.
     "one of the effects of police detention is isolation from friends
     and family"

  Detention is a word for confinement or imprisonment, usually for a
  short time. It's also a punishment where children must stay after
  school.

  If you're in detention, you probably did something wrong: you're
  being confined against your will. The police hold people in
  detention, and so do military forces. Usually, detention is a short
  period of confinement, like if someone is arrested and then
  released. Also, the word is commonly used for an after-school
  punishment for children who have to stay in detention instead of
  going home. One thing is true of both kinds of detention: no one
  wants to be there.

  If you're stuck in detention and all of your friends are outside
  enjoying a sunny day, you might be looking out the window with
  longing.

     Captain Langsdorff, who scuttles his own ship rather than face
     defeat, strongly appealed to Powell and Pressburger."

  When you scuttle, you move with quick anxious steps, like a bug
  running for cover when a light is turned on.

  Use the word scuttle when you want to describe running or fast
  walking that’s characterized by short, hasty steps, like someone or
  something that tries to hurry — a person who is late for work
  scuttling through a crowd of slow-moving pedestrians — but can't. It
  is also found in these well-known lines from T.S. Eliot's poem "The
  Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock": "I should have been a pair of
  ragged claws / Scuttling across the floors of silent seas."

  For Leslie the coming of spring meant the soft pipe of wings as the
  turtle-doves and wood-pigeons arrived, and the sudden flash and
  scuttle of a hare among the myrtles.

   croon to the ladies.

   The verb croon is originally a Scottish word, from the Middle Dutch
   root kronen, "to lament or mourn." When you croon, you hum or sing
   in a soft, low voice, like your heart is breaking. You might croon
   to your child or sweetheart, or maybe you croon in the shower. In
   the 1930s and 40s, a "crooner" was a singer who was known for

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. having or making a high-pitched sound or cry.
     "a high, squeaky voice"

  If your voice is squeaky, it's high and a little shrill, like a
  cartoon character. If your shoes sound squeaky when you walk, you'll
  never be able to sneak up on someone.

  It's hard for people to take you seriously if you always sound a
  little squeaky when you talk. Squishy, noise-making dog toys are
  squeaky, and so is Mickey Mouse's voice, as well as the rusty hinge
  on an old treasure chest. If something's squeaky clean, it's so
  immaculate that it squeaks a little — this phrase probably started
  in the 1970s in advertisements for dishwashing soap.

  abbreviation
  1. distant early warning.

  Dew is moisture caused by condensation of water vapor in the air.
  Dew is what gets your feet wet when you walk across the grass on a
  summer morning.

  Think about a summer night — the sun goes down and the air begins to
  cool, along with everything that is outside, like grass. Then the
  sun comes up. The air heats up again, more quickly that the objects.
  This causes condensation — dew — on grass, plants, car windshields,
  and so on. Dew quickly evaporates in the sun. That's why you really
  only see and feel it early in the morning during summer.

  So at dawn he and I hurried through the hunched and misty
  olive-groves, up the valley where the myrtles were wet and squeaky
  with dew, and on to the top of the little hill.

  вкраплениями

  verb
  1. покрывать пятнами (maculate, spot, fleck, dapple, blotch, splotch)
  2. покрывать крапинками (fleck, mottle)

  DEFINITION

  verb
  1. mark or dot with small patches of color or particles of something.
     "the minarets are flecked with gold leaf"

  Flecked means "dotted" or "speckled." Your favorite of all your
  backyard chickens might be the white and gray flecked hen.

  You could say that a chocolate cake sprinkled with glitter is
  flecked, or describe a snow flecked field in late November. Your
  favorite curtains in your grandmother's house might be the pink
  flecked ones that hang in the kitchen. The verb fleck means to dot
  or scatter, and it comes from an Old Norse root word, flekka, "to
  spot."

  Suddenly the pale morning sky was flecked with dark specks, moving
  as swiftly as arrows, and we could hear the quick wheep of wings.

* languid

  /ˈlæŋ gwɪd/
  
  томный

  adjective
  1. томный (languid, languorous, languishing, lackadaisical, die-away)

     tan evenly"
  2. weak or faint from illness or fatigue.
     "she was pale, languid, and weak, as if she had delivered a
     child"

* languidly :Durrell:
  [2017-05-24 Wed 14:59]

  If you do something languidly, you do it slowly, without haste, as
  if you're a Southern belle without a care in the world lazily
  sitting around on the veranda on a hot day.

  The adverb languidly comes from the Latin word languere, meaning "be
  weak or faint." When you do something such as run or climb stairs
  languidly, you probably do appear weak or sluggish. The word has a
  peaceful and relaxed connotation, however — if you do something
  languidly you aren't trying very hard and you aren't worrying much
  about it. You may chat languidly with your friends on a summer day
  while sipping tea on the patio.

  The turtle-dove, one minute so swift and intent in its flight, now
  fell languidly to earth, followed by a swirl of soft,
  cinnamon-coloured feathers.

** Cuddle might come from the Middle English couth,
   "known" — after all, you only cuddle with those you know. Or,
   cuddle may have started as baby talk that caught on. When you
   cuddle, you give a snuggly hug to make yourself or another person
   feel loved or comforted. As a noun, cuddle describes the time of
   the embrace, like having one last cuddle before leaving for a long
   trip.

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. a large group of animals, especially hoofed mammals, that live, feed, or migrate together or are kept together as livestock.
     "a herd of elephants"

  verb
  1. (with reference to a group of people or animals) move in a particular direction.
     "Nick herded me through the baggage claim and into his Jaguar"
  2. keep or look after (livestock).
     "Hunter and Tripp herded sheep"

  A herd is a bunch of animals — or people who act like a bunch of
  animals. It's also a verb — when people herd animals, they try to
  keep them moving in the same direction.

  A herd usually refers to a group of animals with hooves, like cows
  or sheep (meat-eating animals like wolves cruise around in packs).
  On a farm, sheepdogs are in charge of herding the herd of sheep.
  Herds of buffalo roam the plains. It's rarely a good thing when
  people act like a herd, which is to do what everyone else is doing.
  You might want "to break away from the herd" if everyone is wearing
  pinwheel hats, for example. If you're having trouble getting people
  together, you might say it's like "herding cats." Cats never follow
  directions.

  8. упрямый (stubborn, obstinate, opinionated, headstrong, dogged, gnarled)
  9. сварливый (quarrelsome, grumpy, contentious, cantankerous, crusty, gnarled)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. knobbly, rough, and twisted, especially with age.
     "the gnarled old oak tree"

  You’ve probably heard the word "gnarly" used to describe
  something really awesome. But gnarled means rugged, roughened and
  knotty, like the hands of an old wood carver, as well as the wood
  he carves.

  We owe the adjective gnarled and other forms of the word to our
  friend Shakespeare, who created it in 1603. In “Measure for
  Measure,” he writes, “Thy sharpe and sulpherous bolt splits the
  un-wedgable and gnarled oak.” But gnarled didn't come into use
  again until the 19th century. In any case, word experts believe
  it's related to the Middle English word knar which means “knot in
  wood.”

  His brown face, with its great sweep of nicotine-stained
  moustache, wrinkled into a smile; a gnarled hand appeared from
  the heavy folds of his sheepskin cloak and was raised in salute.

  2. великодушие (generosity, magnanimity, goodness, nobility, liberality, largeness)
  3. благородство (nobility, nobleness, generosity, dignity, honor, splendor)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. the quality of being kind and generous.
     "I was overwhelmed by the generosity of friends and neighbors"


  Generosity is a quality that's a lot like unselfishness. Someone
  showing generosity is happy to give time, money, food, or kindness
  to people in need.

  Generosity is a quality — like honesty and patience — that we all
  probably wish we had more of. When you show generosity, you might
  give away things or money or put others before yourself. But
  generosity is about more than cash and stuff. When you're forgiving
  and gentle to people, you show generosity of spirit. If you give
  others help or credit, that shows generosity. The world would
  certainly be a better place if more people showed generosity to
  others.

  As soon as we had settled down and started to enjoy the island,
  Larry, with characteristic generosity, wrote to all his friends and

* plaintively :Durrell:
  [2017-05-20 Fri 10:12]

  слезно


  If you do something plaintively, you’re doing it in a way that
  expresses sadness or melancholy. When you get tired of playing
  fetch, dogs will look up at you plaintively. Just try to resist
  those big sad eyes, just try!

  The root of the word plaintively is the French word plainte, meaning
  “lamentation.” It’s also the origin of the word plaintiff, meaning a
  person who brings a lawsuit against someone else. The person has a
  complaint, something to lament or be sad about. If she argues her
  case plaintively enough, however, the judge might be convinced by
  her sorrow and rule in her favor.

  'I don't like the highbrow ones,' said Mother plaintively.

* testily :Durrell:

  раздражительно

  adverb
  1. раздражительно (testily, fretfully, rambunctiously)
  2. вспыльчиво (testily)


  The adverb testily means angrily, or in an irritated way. When you
  speak testily, you talk in an impatient, sharp voice.

  When you do something testily, you're not just mad — you're easily
  irritated or frustrated. If you respond testily to your little
  sister's request for more ice cream, you're probably fed up with
  hearing her voice. When people are tired or overworked, they're more
  likely to speak or act testily. The origin is Middle English,
  testif, "headstrong," from the Old French testu, which means
  "stubborn," or literally, "heady," with its Latin root testa, or
  "skull."

  'I don't ask you to discuss art with them,' said Larry testily, 'but
  I think you might try and conceal your revolting taste in

  3. утаить (conceal)
  4. прятать (hide, conceal, bury, secrete, stow away, stash)
  5. утаивать (conceal, withhold, keep, hold back, lock up, keep quiet)

  7. умалчивать (keep silent, conceal, keep quiet, be silent, dissemble, withhold)
  8. укрывать (harbor, cover, shelter, conceal, shield, secrete)
  9. скрадывать (conceal)
  10. запрятать (tuck, conceal, hide away)
  11. хорониться (hide, conceal)

  DEFINITION

  verb
  1. keep from sight; hide.
     "a line of sand dunes concealed the distant sea"


  When you conceal something, you are keeping it from being
  discovered: “To avoid another argument with his cousins, Jonathan
  worked hard to conceal his disappointment at the outcome of the
  race.”

  The verb conceal can be used to describe the hiding of feelings (as
  in “to conceal anger”) or facts (as in “to conceal identity”).
  Conceal also can be used to describe the act of hiding or covering
  an item to prevent discovery. If you eat the last piece of chocolate
  cake, for example, you may want to conceal the evidence by removing
  the icing-stained plate from your room.

  'I don't ask you to discuss art with them,' said Larry testily, 'but

  отвратительный

  adjective
  1. отвратительный (disgusting, hideous, heinous, abominable, revolting, abhorrent)
  2. отталкивающий (repulsive, repellent, unsavory, revolting, appalling, forbidding)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. causing intense disgust; disgusting.
     "there was a revolting smell that lingered in the air"

  verb
  1. rise in rebellion.
     "the insurgents revolted and had to be suppressed"
  2. cause to feel disgust.
     "he was revolted by the stench that greeted him"


  Something revolting is disgusting or distasteful; it turns your
  stomach and can offend your senses.

  Things that are revolting are physically upsetting, like finding
  hair in your soup or stepping in dog poop. Eating spoiled food is
  revolting. Also, revolting things can be less physical. Learning
  that a friend lied to you is revolting. Corruption in government is
  revolting. Injustice is revolting. Many people find obscenity
  revolting. If it offends, disgusts, or upsets you, it's revolting.

* groaning :Durrell:

  стонущий

  noun
  1. стенание (groaning, plaint)
  2. стон (moan, groan, groaning, howl)

  adjective
  1. стонущий (groaning)

  DEFINITION

  verb
  1. make a deep inarticulate sound in response to pain or despair.
     "Marty groaned and pulled the blanket over his head"
  2. (of a thing) make a low creaking or moaning sound when pressure or weight is applied.
     "James slumped back into his chair, making it groan and bulge"


  A groan is a sound of pain or disapproval that doesn't consist of
  words, usually heard after homework is assigned or bad jokes are
  told.

  People groan for lots of reasons: headaches, stomachaches, traffic
  jams, and bad news are just a few groan-worthy things that can
  provoke that moaning, "uuugghhhhh" sound. If someone is complaining
  about something, you could say she's "moaning and groaning." People
  like to moan and groan about the weather, politics, and just about
  everything else.

* lurid :Durrell:

  2. страшный (terrible, fearful, horrible, frightful, frightening, lurid)
  3. бледный (pale, light, pallid, faint, wan, lurid)
  4. бурый (brown, fulvous, lurid, greyish-brown)
  5. огненный (fiery, igneous, flamy, lurid)
  6. пылающий (glowing, flaming, aflame, aglow, fervent, lurid)
  7. трагический (tragic, tragical, Thespian, lurid)
  8. мертвенно-бледный (ashen, ghastly, pallid, livid, lurid, lunary)
  9. грязновато-коричневый (lurid)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. very vivid in color, especially so as to create an unpleasantly harsh or unnatural effect.
     "lurid food colorings"


  When people are lured into looking at something, they may be drawn
  to it because it's a shocking, graphic, or horrible scene, something
  lurid and very vivid that pulls them in. Your mother might complain
  that she hates lurid TV shows — ones that are overly sensationalized
  and meant to shock.

  An expression used to avoid hearing or seeing disturbing things is
  "spare me the lurid details" or "spare me the gory details," and
  people say that so they won't have shocking or ugly images put into
  their imaginations. The word lurid, which entered English in the
  17th century, comes from Latin lūridis, "ghastly, pale yellow." All
  of the synonyms for the adjective lurid describe qualities that can
  turn a person pale: dreadful, nightmarish, and horrific, among
  others. Lurid is just a uniquely dark and gruesome word.

* exasperated :Durrell:
  [2017-05-21 Tue 10:17]

  раздраженный

  verb
  1. раздражать (provoke, irritate, displease, annoy, exasperate, rile)
  2. сердить (incense, anger, disgruntle, irritate, displease, exasperate)
  3. изводить (harass, torment, badger, nag, harry, exasperate)
  4. усиливать (strengthen, increase, enhance, reinforce, intensify, amplify)
  5. выводить из себя (put out, huff, rouse, mad, exasperate, tick off)
  6. доводить до белого каления (exasperate)
  7. возбуждать (excite, stir, stir up, arouse, bring, stimulate)

  DEFINITION

  verb
  1. irritate intensely; infuriate.
     "this futile process exasperates prison officials"


  It’s understandable if you get exasperated, or really frustrated, if
  you’re standing in the supermarket's express lane and everyone in
  front of you has way more than the 10-item maximum.

  Over the centuries, nothing much has happened to the definition of
  this word — the Latin original means "irritated to anger." Speaking
  of which, let's get back to the supermarket, a veritable hotbed of
  exasperated people pushing wobbly-wheeled shopping carts their
  children try to fill with cartoon-branded junk food, brushing past
  unstable store displays that come tumbling down, enduring
  inoffensive but flavorless supermarket music, and emerging into the
  cold light of day unable to remember where they parked the car.

  Larry gave a short, exasperated sigh and picked up his book again.

* distraught :Durrell:
  [2017-05-21 Tue 10:19]

  обезумевший

  adjective
  1. обезумевший (distraught, mad, distracted)
  2. потерявший рассудок (distraught)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. deeply upset and agitated.
     "a distraught woman sobbed and screamed for help"


  If you are upset, you are distraught. If you don't want to explain
  why you are pulling your hair out, just utter "Leave me alone; I'm
  distraught." It'll work.

  While distraught may sound like an old Germanic past participle, it
  is actually an alteration of distract from the Latin distrahere "to
  draw in different directions." If you are distraught, you are so
  upset that it's hard to think straight, hence your mind is "drawn in
  different directions."

  said Mother, distraught.

* hermit                                                            :Durrell:
  [2017-05-21 Tue 10:23]

  отшельник

  noun
  1. отшельник (hermit, recluse, anchorite, ascetic, eremite, solitary)
  2. пустынник (hermit, eremite)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. a person living in solitude as a religious discipline.
     "Secular idleness would have little meaning in solitude, and the
     religious contemplation of the hermit or monk is not in question
     here."
  2. a hummingbird found in the shady lower layers of tropical forests, foraging along a regular route.
     "A local guide took us out the first morning for a half-day of
     birding, including a visit to a lek of performing green hermit
     hummingbirds, and then got us on our way to the Canopy Tower, a
     short distance north of the city."


  You hear about hermits more often than you meet one, and that’s
  because a hermit is someone who likes to be alone, far from people,
  sometimes because of their religious beliefs or maybe because they
  simply want some privacy.

  Hermits like living solo, alone in the woods, up in a mountain, or
  sometimes they live in a city without hardly ever leaving their
  apartment. The root of the word is the Greek erēmos, meaning
  “solitary.” A life of solitude isn’t for everyone, but a hermit
  chooses it for any number of reasons. For example, being able to
  honor their religious beliefs more fully or hating all of humanity
  are two possible motivations to become a hermit.

  'I don't think it's good for us to live like hermits,' said Larry.

* askew :Durrell:

  /əˈskyu/ 
  косо

  adverb
  1. криво (askew, askance, askant)
  2. косо (obliquely, askance, askew, slantwise, aslant, bias)
  3. искоса (askance, askew, askant, all squeegee)

  adjective
  1. косой (oblique, skew, slanting, bias, sidelong, askew)
  2. искаженный (distorted, perverted, misrepresented, warped, mutilated, askew)
  3. кривой (crooked, wry, awry, askew, bent, hooked)

  DEFINITION

  adverb
  1. not in a straight or level position.
     "the door was hanging askew on one twisted hinge"


  Although it sounds like a sneeze, the word askew means lopsided or
  turned and tilted to the side. Like your glasses might be after,
  well, a sneeze.

  The movie “Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events” tells
  the story of three orphans and their struggle to escape their wicked
  guardian, Count Olaf. In the story, the orphans are sent to stay
  with their Aunt Josephine, whose house sits perilously on the edge
  of cliff over a leech-infested lake. The floor of Josephine’s house
  is at an angle, pictures hang off-center, and in fact everything
  appears to be tilted and wildly askew, including their aunt’s mental
  condition.

  Mother glared at him, her spectacles askew.

  [2017-05-21 Tue 10:28]

  безмятежно


  Something done placidly happens in a calm manner. You floated
  placidly, blissfully unaware of the rapids just downstream. I hope
  you brought your life jacket!

  The word placidly is the adverb form of placid, which means "quiet
  and serene." Some words don't change much through their evolution.
  So it is with placidly, which finds its origin in the Latin placidus
  which means — what else? — calm and gentle. We can see the word’s
  meaning in the opening of the poem “Desiderata,” by Max Ehrmann: "Go
  placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there
  may be in silence."

  There was a long silence, during which Larry placidly read his book
  and Mother piled bunches of roses into vases and placed them
  haphazardly round the room, muttering to herself.

     "I cannot believe that it is sensible to spend so much"
  2. readily perceived; appreciable.
     "it will effect a sensible reduction in these figures"


  Sensible means practical and reasonable. If you're wearing sensible
  shoes, they're sturdy, comfortable, good for walking, and your feet
  don't hurt. If you're a sensible person, you're level-headed and
  calm, and you make wise decisions.

  Sensible may not sound exciting — who wants to be like a pair of
  galoshes, when you can be stilettos? But sensible is the voice of
  reason, and when you're tooling along in your convertible, you'll be
  grateful for the sensible 15-mile-per-hour speed limit posted at
  that sharp turn where the road drops off into the canyon. Sensible
  comes from the Latin sensibilis, meaning "perceptible by the
  senses," a meaning that eventually evolved into "having good sense,
  reasonable."

  'If you made sensible suggestions I wouldn't disagree.'

* ludicrous :Durrell:
  [2017-05-21 Tue 10:30]

  /ˈlu dɪ krəs/
  смехотворный

  adjective
  1. смешной (funny, ridiculous, ludicrous, comical, laughable, amusing)
  2. нелепый (absurd, ridiculous, ludicrous, preposterous, grotesque, incongruous)
  3. смехотворный (ridiculous, ludicrous, laughable, derisory, farcical, cockamamie)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. so foolish, unreasonable, or out of place as to be amusing; ridiculous.
     "it's ludicrous that I have been fined"


  Ludicrous things are funny, absurd, or nonsensical. If someone says
  something silly or far-fetched, you could say "That's ludicrous!"

  Ludicrous originally meant something that was funny, playful, or
  joking: a ludicrous comment was just a really funny comment. Over
  time, ludicrous took on a more negative flavor. Now a ludicrous
  statement might be funny, but it's also ridiculous, hard to believe,
  off the wall, or even stupid. When people say "That idea is
  ludicrous!" it usually means the idea could never happen: the notion
  is laughable. Saying Neil Armstrong was the third President would be
  a ludicrous statement.

  'I don't see anything ludicrous in anything I suggested.'

  прибыльный

  adjective
  1. прибыльный (profitable, lucrative, moneymaking, gainful, commercial, juicy)

  твердо

  adverb
  1. твердо (firmly, hard, firm, solidly, crisply, surely)
  2. крепко (firmly, hard, tightly, tight, fast, strongly)
  3. неизменно (invariably, permanently, firmly, eternally, inalterably, abidingly)


  When you do something firmly, you do it with strength or in a secure
  way, like when you shut a door firmly behind you so your cat can't
  get out.

  You might grab a tennis racket firmly in your hands, gripping it
  hard, and then firmly smack the ball across the net. You can also
  act in a firm, or determined way: "I told her firmly that she
  couldn't borrow my clothes without asking next time." The Latin root
  of both firmly and firm is firmus, "strong, steadfast, trusty, or
  stable."

  'We are not moving to another villa,' said Mother firmly; 'I've made
  up my mind about that.'

  3. открыто неповинующийся (defiant)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. showing defiance.
     "she was in a defiant mood"


  Have you ever seen a picture of a protester who is about to be
  carried off by police but is still shouting or resisting, fighting
  to the bitter end? That person is defiant.

  Someone who is defiant is bold, even in the face of defeat. A
  defiant person is usually fighting a powerful enemy. People who
  protest in countries controlled by dictators are defiant. Rosa Parks
  was defiant when she refused to give up her seat on the bus, even
  though the law at that time dictated that black people had to stand
  when whites needed a seat. Small children are defiant too, sometimes
  over nothing more than a request to share their toys.

  She straightened her spectacles, gave Larry a defiant glare, and
  strutted off towards the kitchen, registering determination in every
  inch.

     "peacocks strut through the grounds"
  2. brace (something) with a strut or struts.
     "the holes were close-boarded and strutted"


  When you strut, you walk with a proud swagger that has a little
  arrogance thrown in, like the prance of a running back who has just
  flown past the 250-pound linebackers and planted the ball in the end
  zone.

  You can't strut and be shy about it — when you strut, you know
  people are watching you. The big boss in a gangster film, a model on
  the runway, and the rap artist whose album has just gone platinum
  all know how to strut. The noun form of strut has a little less
  flash and refers to a vertical or horizontal support that holds
  something up, like the long steel bars holding up a building.

  She straightened her spectacles, gave Larry a defiant glare, and
  strutted off towards the kitchen, registering determination in every
  inch.

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. (especially of a person) having an untidy or disheveled appearance.
     "they were unwashed and unkempt"


  Unkempt literally means “not combed,” but use it to describe
  anything with a sloppy appearance. Your hair probably looks unkempt
  when you roll out of bed in the morning. Keep it that way if you're
  going for the rock star look.

  From the fusing of un- “not” with kempt “neat” comes the adjective
  unkempt. Kempt has fallen out of use, but unkempt persists as a
  popular word to describe anything unpolished, rough, or disorderly.
  Pig sties, the corrals where pigs live, are usually quite unkempt.
  That's why your mom keeps calling your messy, unkempt train wreck of
  a room a pig sty.

  фруктовый сад

  noun
  1. фруктовый сад (orchard)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. a piece of land planted with fruit trees.
     "Apple and pear orchards were planted, as were plum thickets
     between some holes."


  An orchard is a tree garden. If you visit New England in autumn,
  make sure to stop by a local apple orchard and pick a few baskets to
  take home.

  From the Old English orceard blossomed our modern-day spelling of
  orchard, a noun meaning “fruit farm.” But you can also use the word
  figuratively to refer to something filled with treats or precious
  content. The US Congregational minister, Henry Ward Beecher, was
  famous for having proclaimed, “A book is a garden, an orchard, a
  storehouse, a party, a company by the way, a counselor, a multitude
  of counselors.”

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. (of metals) beaten out or shaped by hammering.
     "The family later moved to Wheldrake, where they bought The Forge
     and specialised in wrought ironwork."


  Wrought is an adjective that means "molded," "shaped," or
  "manufactured." A wrought-iron fence has been shaped to fit a
  particular ornamental style.

  Wrought is most often used to describe the shaping, altering,
  molding, and manufacture of various metals, like iron, steel,
  aluminum. However, the word is actually related to wreak, which
  means "to cause damage." So we'll sometimes refer to the destruction
  wrought by a storm or some mad scientist like Dr. Frankenstein might
  lament the monster he has wrought with his hands.

  поганка

  noun
  1. поганка (toadstool, grebe, fungus, amanita, dabchick, fairy-mushroom)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. the spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically in the form of a rounded cap on a stalk, especially one that is believed to be inedible or poisonous.
     "The fly agaric or fairy toadstool grows here too, especially
     under birch along with other woodland fungi."


  A toadstool might sound like something you'd find a fairy living
  under, but it's really just a poisonous mushroom.

  If you're walking in the woods and see especially colorful,
  mushrooms, they're probably toadstools. In other words, it's not a
  good idea to eat them. You can use the terms mushroom and toadstool
  interchangeably — although most people save toadstool for fairy
  tales and poisonous fungi; it's not a scientific term. The root is
  probably just the creative combination of the Middle English tadde,
  "toad," and stole, "stool."

  That building falling down on the corner of your block? It's
  decrepit. So is the old man who lives there, if he is weak from age.
  Decrepit means broken down by hard use.

  Decrepit implies that something or someone is a weak, and run down —
  practically falling apart. It's really not a nice word to use about
  a person. If you are trying to say the same thing about a person,
  but more nicely, you might use the word, feeble, which means weak,
  but not disastrously falling apart.

  /simmer down/ 

  1 to reduce in volume by simmering. 
  2 Slang. to become calm or quiet, as from a state of anger or turmoil: 
  - We waited for the audience to simmer down.

  Usually when you're making a soup, you want to bring it to a boil
  and then let it simmer, cooking it just below the boiling point to
  get all the flavors to release.

  The word simmer is usually used to describe the temperature just
  below boiling or the process of cooking something at that
  temperature. But it can also be used to describe a feeling that's
  been simmering or slowly developing over time. It's also a word used
  to describe suppressed anger — that feeling just before you boil
  over. Just in case you do boil over, you might need to take a moment
  to simmer down, a casual expression that means, "Chill out, my
  friend."

  Lugubrious comes from the Latin verb lūgēre, "to mourn." You can
  also listen to the sound of the word: lugubrious sounds slow, heavy,
  and sad. Sometimes, just the "feel" of a word is enough to clue you
  in to its meaning, and lugubrious is one of those words. I was
  feeling great when I got to the concert, but the lugubrious music
  left me in a terrible mood.

  Her name was Lugaretzia, and she was a thin, lugubrious individual,
  whose hair was forever coming adrift from the ramparts of pins and
  combs with which she kept it attached to her skull.

  - She is likely to shoehorn her pain into lugubrious scenarios that
    are perfect for country-music videos
  - Death is not a lugubrious occasion here, but more often a
    celebration of a life

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. a person's face or facial expression.
     "his impenetrable eyes and inscrutable countenance give little
     away"
  2. support.
     "she was giving her specific countenance to the occasion"

  verb
  1. admit as acceptable or possible.
     "he was reluctant to countenance the use of force"


  The noun countenance means the face or its expression. If you're a
  great poker player, you probably have a calm countenance.

  Countenance comes from a French word for "behavior," but it has
  become a fancy term for either the expression of a face or the face
  itself: "He had a puzzled countenance," or "what a charming
  countenance!" Countenance can also be a verb meaning to tolerate or
  approve. If someone does something offensive, tell them, "I'm afraid
  I can't countenance that."

  There was only one thing in life that could bring a smile to
  Lugaretzia's gloomy countenance, a glint to her spaniel eyes, and
  that was a discussion of her ailments.

  недуг

  noun
  1. недуг (disease, ailment, affliction, complaint)
  2. болезнь (disease, illness, sickness, ailment, malady, sick)
  3. недомогание (malaise, indisposition, ailment, distress, complaint, ail)
  4. заболевание (disease, illness, sickness, ailment, case)
  5. нездоровье (illness, indisposition, ailment, ail)
  6. страдание (suffering, misery, pain, distress, anguish, heartache)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. an illness, typically a minor one.
     "Along the way, minor ailments were treated and hypochondria
     dispelled, with adept matter of factness."


  If you've got a rash or a persistent cough, you can call that an
  ailment. Some other common ailments are allergies or chronic
  headaches. They can be a real pain. Literally.

  The word ailment comes from the Old English eglan meaning "to
  trouble, plague, afflict," and the suffix -ment from the Latin
  mentum, which when added to the end of word describing an action
  turns that word into the result of that action. So the result of
  something that troubles, plagues or afflicts you is an ailment — a
  pain or discomfort that just doesn't seem to go away.

  noun
  1. штык (bayonet, spit, bar)

  adjective
  1. штыковой (bayonet)

  verb
  1. колоть штыком (bayonet)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. a swordlike stabbing blade that may be fixed to the muzzle of a rifle for use in hand-to-hand fighting.
     "They include a crossbow, rifles, swords, bayonets , handguns and
     pistols, 340 rounds of ammunition and an Oriental-style throwing
     star."
  2. denoting a fitting for a light bulb, camera lens, or other appliance that is engaged by being pushed into a socket and then twisted to lock it in place.
     "What also makes this Leica look-alike even more of a clone is
     the fact that Konica have made the Hexar RF to accept the special
     Leica-M bayonet mount lenses, as well as their own Konica
     lenses."

  verb
  1. stab (someone) with a bayonet.
     "In the fierce charge Capt. Millett bayoneted two enemy soldiers
     and boldly continued on, throwing grenades, clubbing and
     bayoneting the enemy, while urging his men forward by shouting
     encouragement."


  A bayonet is a knife attached to the end of a rifle. This makes the
  rifle capable of even more violence than before.

  This handy extension to the business end of a rifle gets its name
  from the French city of Bayonne. It's thought to have developed when
  French peasantry ran out of ammo and stuffed their knives into the
  muzzles of their muskets. A bayonet makes the rife more versatile:
  besides shooting people at a distance, it's now more deadly in hand
  to hand combat. With a bayonet, you've got a gun and knife in one
  package.

  noun
  1. кишка (intestine, gut, bowel, hose)

  adjective
  1. внутренний (interior, internal, inner, domestic, inside, intestine)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. (in vertebrates) the lower part of the alimentary canal from the end of the stomach to the anus.
     "the contents of the intestine"


  When you eat food, it first passes into your stomach, and then into
  your intestine. Fun fact: your large intestine is about five feet
  long. Makes you wonder why they don't call it your "long intestine"
  instead.

  The human intestine is split into two sections: the small intestine
  and the large intestine. Your intestine's job is to continue
  breaking down the food you've eaten and absorb nutrients into your
  bloodstream. Intestine comes from the Latin word intestinum, "gut"
  or "bowels," which is the neuter form of the adjective intestinus,
  "inward" or "internal."

  during the last week I have become distressingly familiar with every
  tiny convolution of her larger intestine.'

  1. an awkward way of walking, typically due to pain from an injury.
     "he finished the game almost reduced to a hobble"
  2. a rope or strap used for hobbling a horse or other animal.
     "Soon thereafter ride participants saw her with the short lead rope and hobbles in place, learning a lesson in discipline!"

  verb
  1. walk in an awkward way, typically because of pain from an injury.
     "he was hobbling around on crutches"
  2. tie or strap together (the legs of a horse or other animal) to prevent it from straying.
     "He untacked and unloaded the horses, then hobbled them and set them loose to graze."


  When you hobble, you walk awkwardly or unsteadily because you're in
  pain. You might wipe out on your bike and then hobble back home,
  pushing it in front of you.

  People who hobble, walking with a limp or a shuffle, have most often
  been injured in some way, though a disabled or elderly person might
  hobble as well. You can call the walk itself a hobble as well: "I
  knew that football tackle hurt when I saw your hobble as you left
  the field." The root of hobble is Old English — it's related to the
  Dutch hobbelen, "rock from side to side."

  Shortly afterwards, to our relief, Lugaret2ia's stomach got better,
  but almost immediately her feet gave out, and she would hobble
  pitifully round the house, groaning loudly and frequently.

  2. вурдалак (ghoul, vampire)
  3. вампир (vampire, vampire bat, ghoul)
  4. кладбищенский вор (ghoul)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. an evil spirit or phantom, especially one supposed to rob graves and feed on dead bodies.
     "Ghosts, ghouls , and spirits floated about and chatted with old friends, vampires lurked frighteningly close, and werewolves paced from along the walls."


  A ghoul is an evil demon, ghost, or fiend. On Halloween, the kids
  dressed as fairies and pumpkins look cute. The kids dressed as ghouls,
  with fake blood dripping down their faces and hair matted in knots?
  Not so cute.

  The word ghoul originates in the Arabic word “ghul,” which refers to
  an evil spirit that digs up graves and eats the dead. Some confuse
  ghoul with the word “gremlin,” but the two are not interchangeable. A
  gremlin does not gorge on the flesh of the dead; it is more a
  mischievous imp and troublemaker, famous for causing mechanical
  difficulties in World War II aircraft.

  Larry said that Mother hadn't hired a maid, but a ghoul, and suggested buying her a ball and
  chain.

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. an unexpected or hidden obstacle or drawback.
     "the picture's US release hit a snag"
  2. a sharp, angular, or jagged projection.
     "keep an emery board handy in case of nail snags"
  3. a dead tree.
     "Weak cavity excavators, chickadees nest in hardwood snags , dead limbs, or knot-holes of live trees."

  verb
  1. catch or tear (something) on a projection.
     "thorns snagged his sweater"


  A snag is something sharp that sticks out, like a splinter or a dead
  tree branch. It’s also a hitch in a plan. If you develop a terrible
  cat allergy, your lifelong dream of being a cat trainer has hit a
  snag.

  A snag is something that you get stuck on, either literally or
  figuratively. If you catch your tights on a snag and change into
  different ones, it might put a snag in your plans to dress all in pink
  for the day. When something's caught this way, it snags. Snag, a U.S.
  coinage, was first used when steamboats got stuck on a log or branch
  in the river: "Captain, we've hit a snag!"

  But, apart from Lugaretzia's ailments, there were other snags in the
  house.

* acrid :Durrell:

  4. язвительный (caustic, biting, acrimonious, waspish, incisive, acrid)
  5. раздражающий (annoying, irritating, exasperating, irritative, vexing, acrid)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. having an irritatingly strong and unpleasant taste or smell.
     "acrid fumes"


Acrid is almost always used to describe a smell, and it ain't a pretty
one. Acrid is the nasty sting that you feel in your nose when you walk
by a building that just burned down––it's sulfur mixed with smoke.

You can also use acrid to describe someone's tone or general demeanor
when they are being nasty. Someone about to do something evil might
first give an acrid sneer, or speak in a chillingly acrid tone of
voice, or even shudder as if they'd just bit into something with an
acrid taste.

Some days later Larry sat down on an immense and solid-looking chair,
only to have the back disappear in a cloud of acrid dust.

  2. бурный (stormy, turbulent, rough, rugged, tempestuous, boisterous)
  3. шумливый (noisy, boisterous, riotous, loud, romping, blustery)

  DEFINITION

  adjective
  1. (of a person, event, or behavior) noisy, energetic, and cheerful; rowdy.
     "the boisterous conviviality associated with taverns of that period"


  Boisterous is a word used to describe someone spirited, loud, and
  slightly out of control — like someone with a spring in their step and
  a song in their heart singing to strangers on the street.

  Boisterous means "loud, clamorous, and unrestrained." Think of
  children on a playground or a popular restaurant or a litter of
  puppies as boisterous. This word, which comes from Middle English, can
  also refer to very intense storms. You could call a hurricane
  boisterous, but you will most likely hear this word used to describe
  people.

  We noticed that the town was more crowded, more boisterous, than
  usual, but it never occurred to us that anything special was
  happening until we had finished bargaining with the dealer and made
  our way out of his shop into the narrow, twisted streets.

  2. толкотня (crush, hustle, crowd, crowding, cram, jostle)
  3. столкновение (collision, clash, encounter, conflict, impact, jostle)
  4. давка (crush, crowding, crowd, jam, cram, jostle)

  DEFINITION

  noun
  1. the action of jostling.
     "The resulting jostle of competing versions marks him more than any other poet, even Auden."

  verb
  1. push, elbow, or bump against (someone) roughly, typically in a crowd.
     "passengers arriving and departing, jostling one another"


  The verb jostle describes being bumped and pushed in a horde of people
  — or doing the bumping, like those at a concert who jostle their way
  to the front, and the people jostled out of their spots when the
  newcomers arrive.

  Jostle describes both what someone does, like an impatient person who
  jostles other people out of his way on a crowded bus or subway car,
  and what happens to those victims: They may have their bags and cups
  of hot coffee jostled out of their hands by the impatient one's
  pushing and shoving. When you say the word jostle remember to shove
  the t out of the way because it's silent: "JOSS-ul."

  We were jostled and pushed as we struggled to get back to the place
  where we had left the car.

  лелеять [Listen]

  verb
  1. хранить (store, keep, guard, preserve, retain, enshrine)
  2. помещать в раку (enshrine)
  3. лелеять воспоминание (enshrine)

  DEFINITION

  verb
  1. place (a revered or precious object) in an appropriate receptacle.
     "relics are enshrined under altars"


  If your mother enshrines your first drawing, she might frame it and
  hang it in a special place, as if it were a holy relic. To enshrine is
  to put something special, often religious, into a protective place.

  A shrine is a place considered holy because something special happened
  there or a case that holds sacred items. Places where people have
  claimed to see Jesus sometimes become shines. When you enshrine
  something, it means you are creating a shrine around it, or you are
  giving it its own protected revered space. This can be literal or
  figurative. At a funeral, the minister might say that the deceased

  verb
  1. cause (someone) to become unable to move or walk properly.
     "a crippling disease"


  When something is crippled, it's not working properly. Your bike might
  be crippled by the broken front brake that won't let the wheel turn
  freely.

  You can used the adjective crippled to talk about a broken machine or
  a process that's not working the way it should. It was once commonly
  used to describe a physically disabled person, but this has become an
  offensive term and should be avoided. The word crippled comes from the
  Old English crypel, which is related to cryppan, "to crook or to
  bend."

  tortilla chips. In some parts of the country, a sandwich on a long
  roll is called a wedge, or a wedgie, while in other places, it's a
  hoagie or sub. Just about everywhere, the wedge you get in the
  schoolyard means your underwear are pulled up between your butt
  cheeks, which is consistent with the verb form of wedge: to squeeze
  into a tight space.

  This dark multi-coloured wedge of humanity moved slowly towards the
  dark door of the church, and we were swept along with it, wedged
  like pebbles in a larva-flow.

  through small openings, such as pores. Think of how you exude sweat
  after a workout.

  The word exude is often used to describe sweating — the original Latin
  root, sudāre means "to sweat." Still, we frequently use the word exude
  to refer to anything that seems to ooze or pour forth from an object
  or person. John F. Kennedy was said to exude confidence, while his
  wife, Jackie, exuded class. But the verb can also have a negative
  sense, as when we say a skunk exudes a foul smell.

  I was caught firmly between five fat peasant women, who pressed on
  me like cushions and exuded sweat and garlic, while Mother was
  hopelessly entangled between two of the enormous Albanian shepherds.
