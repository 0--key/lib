     but not any simpler
     #+END_CENTER

** Tables formatting
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The default setting makes tables without cell borders and frame. If
   you would like to change this for individual tables, place something
   like the following before the table:
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+CAPTION: This is a table with lines around and between cells
      #+ATTR_HTML: :border 2 :rules all :frame border  
   #+END_EXAMPLE

      #+CAPTION: This is a table with lines around and between cells
      #+ATTR_HTML: :border 2 :rules all :frame border

      | Firts row | Second row | Third row |
      |-----------+------------+-----------|
      | this      | is         | a test    |

** The images inset
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+CAPTION: An image with color samples
      #+ATTR_HTML: :alt four figures image :title Color test :align right  
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   Some arbitrary text to unveil ~align~ property in *html5* attribute.
   Seems like it might look nice and pretty with no any unnecessary
   complications.
      #+CAPTION: An image with color samples
      #+ATTR_HTML: :alt four figures image :title Color test :align right
