* Jargon

** Munge/Munging/Wrangling
   Describes the overall process of manipulating unstructured and/or messy data
   into a structured or clean form. The word has snuck its way into the jargon
   of many modern day data hackers. Munge rhymes with “lunge”.

** Interacting with the outside world
   Reading and writing with a variety of file formats and databases.

** Preparation
   Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing, and
   transforming data for analysis.

** Transformation
   Applying mathematical and statistical operations to groups of data sets to
   derive new data sets. For example, aggregating a large table by group variables.

** Modeling and computation
   Connecting your data to statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other
   computational tools

** Presentation
   Creating interactive or static graphical visualizations or textual summaries

   

** Cracking Interview
*** A hiring committee typically wants to see one interviewer
    who is an "enthusiastic endorser"
*** Be ready to code on a whiteboard and make sure all of your
    thoughts are clearly communicated
*** Well, I may be embellishing a little, but hear me out.
*** I am not exaggerating to say that I did not understand
    a single answer she gave during the interview p.16
