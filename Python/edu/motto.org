*** If you’ve already studied Python in any sort of depth,
    you probably already know that this is where its OOP support begins
    to become attractive:

    Structure
    With OOP,  can naturally associate processing logic with record data—classes
    provide both a program unit that combines logic and data in a single package and
    a hierarchy that allows code to be easily factored to avoid redundancy.

    Encapsulation
    With OOP,  can also wrap up details such as name processing and pay increases
    behind method functions—i.e.,  are free to change method implementations
    without breaking their users.

    Customization
    And with OOP,  have a natural growth path. Classes can be extended and cus-
    tomized by coding n subclasses, without changing or breaking already working
    code.

*** Munge/Munging/Wrangling
    Describes the overall process of manipulating unstructured and/or messy data
    into a structured or clean form. The word has snuck its way into the jargon
    of many modern day data hackers. Munge rhymes with “lunge”.

*** Interacting with the outside world
    Reading and writing with a variety of file formats and databases.

*** Preparation
    Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing, and
    transforming data for analysis.

*** Transformation
    Applying mathematical and statistical operations to groups of data sets to
    derive new data sets. For example, aggregating a large table by group variables.

*** Modeling and computation
    Connecting your data to statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other
    computational tools

*** Presentation
    Creating interactive or static graphical visualizations or textual summaries

    

** Cracking Interview
*** A hiring committee typically wants to see one interviewer
    who is an "enthusiastic endorser"
*** Be ready to code on a whiteboard and make sure all of your
    thoughts are clearly communicated
*** Well, I may be embellishing a little, but hear me out.
*** I am not exaggerating to say that I did not understand
    a single answer she gave during the interview p.16
