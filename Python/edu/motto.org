**** DONE Determiners and quantifiers [100%]
     - Determiners
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       D are words wich come at the beginning of the noun phrase.
       They tell use whether the noun is specific or general.

       + Specific D:
	 - the definite article: the
	 - possesives: my, your, his, her, its, our, their, whose
	 - demonstratives: this, that, these, those
	 - interrogatives: which
       + General D:
	 - a, an, any, another, other, what

	     we are talking about all of those people or things
	   + we use another to talk about an additional person or thing
	   + other is the plural form of another
       + With no D:
	 - uncount nouns
	 - plural nouns
     - Quantifiers
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       We use quantifiers when we want to give someone information about
       the number of something: how much or how many.
       #+END_QUOTE
***** DONE interrogative determiners: which and what
      - We use 'which' as a determiner to ask a question about a specific
	group of people or things:
	+ Which restaurant did you go to?
	+ Which countries in South America have you visited?
      - When we are asking a general question we use 'what' as a determiner:
	+ What films do you like?
	+ What university did you go to?
***** DONE indefinite article: a and an
      1. We use the indefinite article, a/an, with count nouns when the 
	 hearer/reader does not know exactly which one we are referring to:
	 - Police are searching for a 14 year-old girl.
      2. We also use it to show the person or thing is one of a group:
	 - She is a pupil at London Road School.
      3. We do not use an indefinite article with plural nouns and uncount
	 nouns:
	 - She was wearing blue shoes. (=plural noun)
	 - She has short blonde hair. (=uncount noun)
      4. We use a/an to say what someone is or what job they do:

      - I was talking to a guy about that the other day. (1)
      - He seems to know a lot about wine. (3)

***** DONE definite article: the
      We use the definite article in front of a noun when we believe the
      hearer/reader knows exactly what we are referring to.
      - because there is only one:
	+ The Pope is visiting Russia.
	+ The Moon is very bright tonight.
	+ The Shah of Iran was deposed in 1979.
	+ This is why we use the definite article with a superlative
	  adjective:
	  = He is the tallest boy in the class.
	  = It is the oldes building in the town.
      - because there is only one in that place or in those surroundings:
        | We live in a small vilage next to the church  | The church in our village |
        |-----------------------------------------------+---------------------------|
        | Dad, can I borrow the car?                    | The car that belongs to   |
        |                                               | our family                |
        | When we stayed at my grandmother's house we   |                           |
        | went to the beach every day.                  | The beach near my         |
        |                                               | grandmother's house       |
        | Look at the boy in the blue shirt over there. | The boy I am pointing at  |
      - because we have already mentioned it;
	+ A woman who fell 10 meters from High Peak was lifted to safety by
	  helicopter. The woman fell while climbing.
	+ The rescue is the latest in a series of incidents on High Peak.
	  In January last year two men walking the peak were killed in a fall.
	  
	  We also use the definite article:
	  
      - to say something about all the things referred by a noun:
	+ The wolf is not really a dangerous animal (= Wolves are not 
	  really dangerous animals)
	+ The kangaroo is found only in Australia (= Kangaroos are found
	  only in Australia)
	+ The heart pumps blood around the body. (= Hearts pump blood 
	  around bodies)

      - to refer to a system or service:
	+ How long does it take on the train?

	groups of people:
	+ Life can be very hard for the poor.
	+ I think the rich should pay more taxes.
	+ She works for a group to help the disabled.

	  The definite article with names:
	  
      - We do not normally use the definite article with names:
	+ William Shakespeare wrote Hamlet.
	+ Paris is the capital of France.
	+ Iran is in Asia.
      - But we do use the definite article with:
	+ countries whose names include words like kingdom, states or republic:
	  + the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Nepal, the United States
	+ countries which have pluran nouns in their names:
	  - the Netherlands, the Philippines.
	+ geographical features, like as mountain ranges, groups of islands
	  rivers, seas, oceans and canals:

	    Canal
	+ newspapers;

	+ hotels, pubs and restaurants (we do not use the definite article 
	  in the name of the hotel or restaurant is the name of the owner)
	+ families: the Obamas, the Jacksons
	  
***** DONE quantifiers
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      We use quantifiers when we want to give someone information about
      the number of something: how much or how many.
      #+END_QUOTE

      Sometimes we use a quantifier in the  place of a determiner:
      - Most children start school at the age of five.
      - We ate some bread and butter.
      - We saw lots of birds.
	
      We use these quantifiers with both count and uncount nouns:
      | all  | any  | enough | less    | a lot of | lots of |
      | more | most | no     | none of | some     |         |

      and some more colloquial forms:
      | plenty of | heaps of | a load of | loads of | tons of | etc |

      some quantifiers can be used only with count nouns:
      | both | each | either | (a) few | fewer | neither | several |

      and some more colloquial forms:
      | a couple of | hundreds of | thousands of | etc |

      some quantifiers can be used only with uncount nouns:
      | a little | (not) much | a bit of | 

      and, particularly with abstract nouns such as time, money, trouble,
      etc:, we often use:
      | a great deal of | a good deal of | 

      Members of groups
      
      You can put a noun after a quantifier when you are talking about
      members of a group in general:
      - Few snakes are dangerous.
      - Both brothers work with their father.
      - I never have enough money.

      ...but if you are talking about a specific group of people or things,
      use of the... as well:
      - Few of the snakes are dangerous.
      - All of the children live at home.
      - He has spent all of his money.

      Note that, if we are talking about two people or things we use
      quantifiers both, either and neither.
      | One supermarket | Two supermarkets     | More than two supermarkets |
      |-----------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
      | The supermarket | Both supermarkets    | All the supermarkets were  |
      | was closed      | were closed.         | closed.                    |
      |-----------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
      | The supermarket | Neither of the       | None of the supermarkets   |
      | wasn't open.    | supermarkets was     | were open.                 |
      |                 | open.                |                            |
      |-----------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
      | I don't think   | I don't think either | I don't think any of the   |
      | the supermarket | of the supermarkets  | supermarkets were open.    |
      | was open.       | was open.            |                            | 

      & Nouns with either and neither have a singular verb.

      Singular quantifiers:

      We use every or each with a singular noun to mean all:
      | There was a party in every street      | = | There were parties in all the streets      |
      |----------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------|
      | Every shop was decorated with          |   | All the shops were decorated with          |
      | flowers                                | = | flowers.                                   |
      |----------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------|
      | Each child was given a prize.          | = | All the children were given a prize.       |
      |----------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------|
      | There was a prize in each competition. | = | There were prizes in all the competitions. |

      We often use every to talk about times like days, weeks and years:
      - When we were children we had holidays at our grandmother's every year.
      - When we stayed at my grandmother's house we went to the beach every day.
      - We visit our daughter every Christmas.

      BUT: We do not use a determiner with every and each. We DO NOT say:
      -- The every shop was decorated with flowers.
      -- The each child was given a prize.

      Activities:

      - Could you dive me some advice?
      - There are only a few players in the world with his skill.
      - Every year I promise myself I will lose some weight.
      - When I got there both the banks had closed.
      - Can you give me a couple of pounds for the bus fare?
      - I went to a great deal of trouble to get those tickets.
      - Either that dog goes or I do!

     One easy way to create a unique skill is to combine two
     seemingly unrelated skills into one skill.  Being the best
     computer scientist in the world is really hard.  Being the
     person who knows the most about dolphins is really hard.
     But being the person who best knows about the intersection
     of software and dolphins is accomplishable.

     Decorators are convenient for factoring out common prologue,
     epilogue, and/or exception-handling code in similar functions
     (much like context managers and the "with" statement), such
     as:
     - Acquiring and releasing locks (e.g. a "@with_lock(x)" decorator);
     - Entering a database transaction (and committing if successful, 
       or rolling back upon encountering an unhandled exception);
     - Asserting pre- or post-conditions (e.g. "@returns(int)");
     - Parsing arguments or enforcing authentication (especially in web 
       application servers like Pylons where there's a global request 
       and/or cookies object that might accompany formal parameters 
       to a function);
     - Instrumentation, timing or logging, e.g. tracing every time a

*** Let’s step back for a moment and consider how far ’ve come.

**** 

*** If you’ve already studied Python in any sort of depth,
    you probably already know that this is where its OOP support begins
    to become attractive:

    Structure
    With OOP,  can naturally associate processing logic with record data—classes
    provide both a program unit that combines logic and data in a single package and
    a hierarchy that allows code to be easily factored to avoid redundancy.

    Encapsulation
    With OOP,  can also wrap up details such as name processing and pay increases
    behind method functions—i.e.,  are free to change method implementations
    without breaking their users.

    Customization
    And with OOP,  have a natural growth path. Classes can be extended and cus-
    tomized by coding n subclasses, without changing or breaking already working
    code.

*** Munge/Munging/Wrangling
    Describes the overall process of manipulating unstructured and/or messy data
    into a structured or clean form. The word has snuck its way into the jargon
    of many modern day data hackers. Munge rhymes with “lunge”.

*** Interacting with the outside world
    Reading and writing with a variety of file formats and databases.

*** Preparation
    Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing, and
    transforming data for analysis.

*** Transformation
    Applying mathematical and statistical operations to groups of data sets to
    derive new data sets. For example, aggregating a large table by group variables.

*** Modeling and computation
    Connecting your data to statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other
    computational tools

        Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of
	programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct
	a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining
	to human beings what we want a computer to do.

	The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an
	essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of
	style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names
	of variables carefully and explains what each variable means.
	He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because
	its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for
	human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal
	methods that reinforce each other.

*** Getting Things Done is a time-management method, described in a book of the same title
    by productivity consultant David Allen. It is often referred to as GTD. The GTD method
    rests on the idea of moving planned tasks and projects out of the mind by recording
    them externally and then breaking them into actionable work items. This allows one to
    focus attention on taking action on tasks, instead of on recalling them.

******* Intermezzo: Coding Style
	Making it easy for others to read your code
	is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps
	tremendously for that.
	+ Suggestions:
	  - When possible, put comments on a line of their own;
	  - Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to
	use "CamelCase" for classes and "lower_case_with_underscores" for
	functions and methods.

******* Dictionaries
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	Unlike

	contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any
	mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a
	key. You can't use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place
	using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like "append()"
	and "extend()".

******* Looping Techniques
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session
          knights = {'gallahad': 'the pure', 'robin': 'the brave'}
          for k, v in knights.items():
              print(k, v)

          for i, v in enumerate(['tic', 'tac', 'toe']):
              print(i, v)

          # To loop over two or more sequences at the same time, the entries can
          # be paired with the "zip()" function.

          questions = ['name', 'quest', 'favorite color']
          answers = ['lancelot', 'the holy grail', 'blue']
          for q, a in zip(questions, answers):
              print('What is your {0}?  It is {1}.'.format(q, a))

	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: ... ... robin the brave
	: gallahad the pure
	: ... ... 0 tic

	: 2 toe
	: ... ... >>> >>> >>> ... ... What is your name?  It is lancelot.
	: What is your quest?  It is the holy grail.
	: What is your favorite color?  It is blue.

	Sometimes it is tempting to iterate some sequences in their reverse
	order:
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session

          for i in reversed(range(1, 10, 2)):
              print(i)

          # To loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the "sorted()" function
          # which returns a new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered.

          basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana']
          for f in sorted(set(basket)):
              print(f)

	#+END_SRC

******* More on Modules
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	Note: For efficiency reasons, each module is only imported once per
	interpreter session.  Therefore, if you change your modules, you
	must restart the interpreter -- or, if it's just one module you want
	to test interactively, use "importlib.reload()", e.g. "import
	importlib; importlib.reload(modulename)".

******* The "dir()" Function
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	The built-in function "dir()" is used to find out which names a module
	defines.  It returns a sorted list of strings.

	Without arguments, "dir()" lists the names you have defined currently.

	Packages are a way of structuring Python's module namespace by using
	"dotted module names".

******** Importing * From a Package
	 For example, the file "sound/effects/__init__.py" could contain the
	 following code:
	 
	 __all__ = ["echo", "surround", "reverse"]
	 
	 This would mean that "from sound.effects import *" would import the
	 three named submodules of the "sound" package.

******** Methods of File Objects
	 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
	 It is good practice to use the "with" keyword when dealing with file
	 objects.  This has the advantage that the file is properly closed
	 after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised on the way.
	 It is also much shorter than writing equivalent "try"-"finally"
	 blocks:

       #+END_SRC
****** 2.1.2 Use the * operator to represent the “rest” of a list
****** 2.2 Dictionaries
       2.2.1 Use the default parameter of dict.get to provide default
       values
       2.2.2 Use a dict comprehension to build a dict clearly and
       efficiently
****** 2.3 Strings
       2.3.1 Prefer the format function for formatting strings
       2.3.2 Use ''.join when creating a single string for list elements
       2.3.3 Chain string functions to make a simple series of transfor-
       mations more clear
****** 2.4 Classes
       2.4.1 Use underscores in function and variable names to help mark
       “private” data
       2.4.2 Define __str__ in a class to show a human-readable repre-
       sentation
****** 2.5 Sets
       2.5.1 Use sets to eliminate duplicate entries from Iterable con-
       tainers
       2.5.2 Use a set comprehension to generate sets concisely
       2.5.3 Understand and use the mathematical set operations
****** 2.6 Generators
       2.6.1 Use a generator to lazily load infinite sequences
       2.6.2 Prefer a generator expression to a list comprehension
       for simple iteration
****** 2.7. Context Managers
       2.7.1 Use a context manager to ensure resources are properly
       managed
****** 2.8. Tuples
       2.8.1 Use tuples to unpack data
       2.8.2 Use _ as a placeholder for data in a tuple that should be
       ignored
****** 2.9 Variables
       2.9.1 Avoid using a temporary variable when performing a swap
       of two values
***** 3 Organizing Your Code
****** 3.1 Modules and Packages
       3.1.1 Use modules for encapsulation where other languages would
       use Objects
****** 3.2 Formatting
       3.2.1 Use all capital letters when declaring global constant values
       3.2.2 Avoid placing multiple statements on a single line
       3.2.3 Format your code according to PEP8
****** 3.3. Executable Scripts
       3.3.1 Use sys.exit in your script to return proper error codes
       3.3.2 Use the if __name__ == '__main__' pattern to allow a
       file to be both imported and run directly
****** 3.4 Imports
       3.4.1 Prefer absolute imports to relative imports
       3.4.2 Do not use from foo import * to import the contents of a
       module.
       3.4.3 Arrange your import statements in a standard order
***** 4 General Advice
****** 4.1 Avoid Reinventing the Wheel
       4.1.1 Learn the Contents of the Python Standard Library
       4.1.2 Get to know PyPI (the Python Package Index)
****** 4.2 Modules of Note
       4.2.1 Learn the contents of the itertools module
       4.2.2 Use functions in the os.path module when working with
       directory paths
