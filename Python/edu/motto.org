       the number of something: how much or how many.
       #+END_QUOTE
***** DONE interrogative determiners: which and what
      - We use 'which' as a determiner to ask a question about a specific
	group of people or things:
	+ Which restaurant did you go to?

      - When we are asking a general question we use 'what' as a determiner:
	+ What films do you like?

      1. We use the indefinite article, a/an, with count nouns when the 
	 hearer/reader does not know exactly which one we are referring to:
	 - Police are searching for a 14 year-old girl.
      2. We also use it to show the person or thing is one of a group:

***** DONE definite article: the
      We use the definite article in front of a noun when we believe the
      hearer/reader knows exactly what we are referring to.
      - because there is only one:
	+ The Pope is visiting Russia.
	+ The Moon is very bright tonight.
	+ The Shah of Iran was deposed in 1979.
	+ This is why we use the definite article with a superlative
	  adjective:
	  = He is the tallest boy in the class.
	  = It is the oldes building in the town.
      - because there is only one in that place or in those surroundings:
        | We live in a small vilage next to the church  | The church in our village |
        |-----------------------------------------------+---------------------------|
        | Dad, can I borrow the car?                    | The car that belongs to   |

        | Look at the boy in the blue shirt over there. | The boy I am pointing at  |
      - because we have already mentioned it;
	+ A woman who fell 10 meters from High Peak was lifted to safety by
	  helicopter. The woman fell while climbing.
	+ The rescue is the latest in a series of incidents on High Peak.
	  In January last year two men walking the peak were killed in a fall.
	  
	  We also use the definite article:
	  
      - to say something about all the things referred by a noun:
	+ The wolf is not really a dangerous animal (= Wolves are not 
	  really dangerous animals)
	+ The kangaroo is found only in Australia (= Kangaroos are found

      - We do not normally use the definite article with names:
	+ William Shakespeare wrote Hamlet.

***** DONE quantifiers
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      We use quantifiers when we want to give someone information about
      the number of something: how much or how many.
      #+END_QUOTE

      Sometimes we use a quantifier in the  place of a determiner:
      - Most children start school at the age of five.
      - We ate some bread and butter.
      - We saw lots of birds.
	
      We use these quantifiers with both count and uncount nouns:
      | all  | any  | enough | less    | a lot of | lots of |
      | more | most | no     | none of | some     |         |

      and some more colloquial forms:
      | plenty of | heaps of | a load of | loads of | tons of | etc |

      some quantifiers can be used only with count nouns:
      | both | each | either | (a) few | fewer | neither | several |

      and some more colloquial forms:
      | a couple of | hundreds of | thousands of | etc |

      some quantifiers can be used only with uncount nouns:
      | a little | (not) much | a bit of | 

      and, particularly with abstract nouns such as time, money, trouble,
      etc:, we often use:
      | a great deal of | a good deal of | 

      Members of groups
      
      You can put a noun after a quantifier when you are talking about
      members of a group in general:
      - Few snakes are dangerous.
      - Both brothers work with their father.
      - I never have enough money.

      ...but if you are talking about a specific group of people or things,
      use of the... as well:
      - Few of the snakes are dangerous.
      - All of the children live at home.
      - He has spent all of his money.

      Note that, if we are talking about two people or things we use
      quantifiers both, either and neither.
      | One supermarket | Two supermarkets     | More than two supermarkets |
      |-----------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
      | The supermarket | Both supermarkets    | All the supermarkets were  |
      | was closed      | were closed.         | closed.                    |
      |-----------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
      | The supermarket | Neither of the       | None of the supermarkets   |
      | wasn't open.    | supermarkets was     | were open.                 |
      |                 | open.                |                            |
      |-----------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
      | I don't think   | I don't think either | I don't think any of the   |
      | the supermarket | of the supermarkets  | supermarkets were open.    |
      | was open.       | was open.            |                            | 

      & Nouns with either and neither have a singular verb.

      Singular quantifiers:

      We use every or each with a singular noun to mean all:
      | There was a party in every street      | = | There were parties in all the streets      |
      |----------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------|
      | Every shop was decorated with          |   | All the shops were decorated with          |
      | flowers                                | = | flowers.                                   |
      |----------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------|
      | Each child was given a prize.          | = | All the children were given a prize.       |
      |----------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------|
      | There was a prize in each competition. | = | There were prizes in all the competitions. |

      We often use every to talk about times like days, weeks and years:
      - When we were children we had holidays at our grandmother's every year.
      - When we stayed at my grandmother's house we went to the beach every day.
      - We visit our daughter every Christmas.

      BUT: We do not use a determiner with every and each. We DO NOT say:
      -- The every shop was decorated with flowers.
      -- The each child was given a prize.

      Activities:

      - Could you dive me some advice?
      - There are only a few players in the world with his skill.
      - Every year I promise myself I will lose some weight.
      - When I got there both the banks had closed.
      - Can you give me a couple of pounds for the bus fare?
      - I went to a great deal of trouble to get those tickets.
      - Either that dog goes or I do!

**** DONE Possessives [100%]
***** DONE nouns
      We use a noun with 's with a singular noun show possession:
      - We are having a party at John's house.
      - Michael drove his friend's car.
	
      We use s' with plural noun ending in -s:
      - This is my parents' house.
      - Those are ladies' shoes.

      But we use 's with other plural nouns:
      - These are men's shoes.
      - Children's clothes are very expensive.

      We can use a possessive instead of a noun phrase to avoid repeating
      words:
      | Is that John's car? | No, it's Mary's [car]. |
      |---------------------+------------------------|
      | Whose coat is this? | It's my wife's [coat]. |   

***** DONE adjectives

      | We      | us     | our       |

	+ That's our house.
	+ My car is very old.
      - for relations and friends:
	+ My mother is a doctor.
	+ How old is your sister?
      - for parts of the body:

      - Did you know cyclists shave their legs?
      - Do you open your eyes under water?
      - I can't touch my toes any more. Time to go to the gym.

      | They    | them   | their           | theirs              |

      We can use a possessive pronoun instead of a noun phrase:

      | [my coat] is brown  |   |                   |   |                | 

      We can use possessive pronouns after of.

      - Susan is one of my friends.
      - Susan is a friend of mine.

      - I am one of Susan's friends.
      - I am a friend of Susan's.

     One easy way to create a unique skill is to combine two
     seemingly unrelated skills into one skill.  Being the best
     computer scientist in the world is really hard.  Being the
     person who knows the most about dolphins is really hard.
     But being the person who best knows about the intersection
     of software and dolphins is accomplishable.

     But if you and I have a debate and we argue two sides, and
     you are proven wrong, that doesn't make me right.  I could

     Decorators are convenient for factoring out common prologue,
     epilogue, and/or exception-handling code in similar functions
     (much like context managers and the "with" statement), such
     as:
     - Acquiring and releasing locks (e.g. a "@with_lock(x)" decorator);
     - Entering a database transaction (and committing if successful, 
       or rolling back upon encountering an unhandled exception);
     - Asserting pre- or post-conditions (e.g. "@returns(int)");
     - Parsing arguments or enforcing authentication (especially in web 
       application servers like Pylons where there's a global request 
       and/or cookies object that might accompany formal parameters 
       to a function);
     - Instrumentation, timing or logging, e.g. tracing every time a

      |-----------------------+-----------------------|
      | Whoswe coat is this?  | Whose is this coat?   |

***** DONE reciprocal pronouns (обоюдный)
      - They helped to look after each other's children.
      - We often stayed in one another's houses.
      One another refers to group larger than two members.
**** DONE Adjectives [66%]
     We use adjectives to describe nouns.
     Most adjectives can be used in front of a noun:
     - They have a beautiful house.
     - We saw a very exciting film last night.

     or after a link verb like be, look and feel:
     - Their house is beautiful.
     - That film looks interesting.

     Examples:
     - I saw a really good program me on TV last night.
     - My sister's got two young children.
     - I didn't know your mother was French.
     - Are you OK? You look terrible!
     - I've just bought a new printer.
     - This chicken doesn't smell very good. How old is it?
     - They're building a big factory next to our home.
     - Poland can be a very cold country in the winter.
     - Sorry, can you stop the car? I feel sick.
     - I'd like to see than new Michael Moore film. It sounds
       interesting.
***** DONE adjectives: -ed and -ing
      A lot of adjectives are made from verbs by adding -ing or -ed:
      - ing adjectives:
	the commonest -ing adjectives are:
	+ amusing
	+ shocking
	+ surprising
	+ frightening
	+ interesting
	+ disappointing
	  
      If you call something interesting you mean it interests you.
      If you call something frightening you mean it frightening you.

      Examples:
      - I read very interesting article in the newspaper today.
      - That Dracula film was absolutely terrifying.
	
      -ed adjectives:

      The commonest -ed adjectives are:
      + annoyed
      + bored
      + frightened
      + worried
      + tried

	If something annoys you, you can say you feel annoyed. If something
	interests you, you can say you are interested.

	Example:
	- The children had nothing to do. They are bored.

***** DONE order of adjectives
      Sometimes we use more than one adjective in front of a noun:
      - He was a nice intelligent young man.
      - She had a small round black wooden box.

      Opinion adjectives:

      Some adjectives give a general opinion. we can use these adjectives to
      describe almost any noun:

      | good      | bad       | lovely | strange   | beautiful | nice  |
      |-----------+-----------+--------+-----------+-----------+-------|
      | brilliant | excellent | awful  | important | wonderful | nasty | 

      Some adjectives give a specific opinion. We only use these adjectives
      to describe particular kinds of noun:
      - Food:
	+ tasty
	+ delicious
      - Furniture, buildings:
	+ comfortable
	+ uncomfortable
      - People, animals:
	+ clever
	+ friendly
	+ intelligent

      We usually put a general opinion in front of a specific opinion:
      - Nice tasty soup.
      - A nasty uncomfortable armchair.
      - A lovely intelligent animal.

      Usually we put an adjective that gives an opinion in front of an adjective
      that is descriptive:
      - a nice red dress;
      - a silly old man;
      - those horrible yellow curtains

      We often have two adjectives in front of a noun:
      - a handsome young man;
      - a big black car;
      - that horrible big dog

      Sometimes we have three adjectives, but it is unusual:
      - a nice handsome young man;
      - a big black American car;
      - that horrible big fierce dog

      It is very unusual to have more than three adjectives.

      Adjectives usually come in this order:

      | 1       | 2        |    3 |     4 |   5 |      6 |           7 |        8 |
      |---------+----------+------+-------+-----+--------+-------------+----------|
      | General | Specific | Size | Shape | Age | Colour | Nationality | Material |
      | opinion | opinion  |      |       |     |        |             |          |

      We use some adjectives only after a link verb:

      | afraid | alive | alone | asleep | content | glad |
      |--------+-------+-------+--------+---------+------|
      | ill    | ready | sorry | sure   | unable  | well |

      Some of the commonest -ed adjectives are normally used only after a
      link verb:
      - annoyed;
      - finished;
      - bored;
      - pleased;
      - thrilled

      We say:
      - Our teacher was ill.
      - My uncle was very glad when he heard the news.
      - The policeman seemed to be very annoyed.

      A few adjectives are used only in front of a noun:
      | north | northern | countless  | eventful |
      | south | southern | occasional | indoor   |
      | east  | eastern  | lone       | outdoor  |
      | west  | western  |            |          |

      We say:
      - He lives in the eastern district.
      - There were countless problems with the new machinery.

***** DONE comparative and superlative adjectives
      We use comparative adjectives to describe people and things:
      - This car is certainly better but it's much more expensive.
      - I'm feeling happier now.
      - We need a bigger garden.

      We use than when we want to compare one thing with another:
      - She us two years older than me.
      - New York is much bigger than Boston.
      - He is a better player than Ronaldo.
      - France is a bigger country than Britain.

      When we want to describe how something or someone changes we can
      use two comparatives with and:
      - The balloon got bigger and bigger.
      - Everything is getting more and more expensive.
      - Grandfather is looking older and older.

      We often use the with comparative adjectives to show that one
      thing depends on another:
      - When you drive faster it is more dangerous.
	+ The faster you drive, the more dangerous it is.
      - When they climbed higher it got colder.
	+ The higher they climbed, the colder it got.

      Superlative adjectives:

      We use the with a superlative:
      - It was the happiest day of my life.
      - Everest is the highest mountain in the world.
      - That's the best film I've seen this year.
      - I have three sisters, Jan is the oldest and Angela is the youngest.

***** DONE intensifiers

      We use words like very, really and extremely to make adjectives
      stronger:
      - It's a very interesting story.
      - Everyone was very excited.
      - It's a really interesting story.
      - Everyone was extremely excited.

      We call these words intensifiers. Other intensifiers are:

      | amazingly  | exceptionally | incredibly |
      |------------+---------------+------------|
      | remarkably | particularly  | unusually  |

      We also use enough to say more about an adjective, but enough comes
      after its adjective:
      - If you are seventeen you are old enough to drive a car.
      - I can't wear those shoes. They're not big enough.

      Intensifiers with strong adjectives:

      Strong adjectives are words like:

      | enormous, huge             | very big    |
      |----------------------------+-------------|
      | tiny                       | very small  |
      |----------------------------+-------------|
      | brilliant                  | very clever |
      |----------------------------+-------------|
      | awful, terrible,           |             |
      | disgusting, dreadful       | very bad    |
      |----------------------------+-------------|
      | certain                    | very sure   |
      |----------------------------+-------------|
      | excellent, perfect, ideal, |             |
      | wonderful, splendid        | very good   |
      |----------------------------+-------------|
      | delicious                  | very tasty  |

      We do not use very with these adjectives.
      With strong adjectives, we normally use intensifiers like:

      | absolutely | completely    | totally      | utterly |
      |------------+---------------+--------------+---------|
      | really     | exceptionally | particularly | quite   | 

      - The film was absolutely awful.
      - He was an exceptionally brilliant child.
      - The food smelled really disgusting.

      Advanced:

      Some intensifiers go with particular adjectives depending on
      the meaning of the adjective:

      - I’m afraid your wife is dangerously ill.
      - He was driving dangerously fast.
      - The car was seriously damaged.
      - Fortunately none of the passengers was seriously hurt.

      Some intensifiers go with particular adjectives. For example we
      use the intensifier highly with the adjectives successful,
      intelligent, likely and unlikely:

      - He was highly intelligent.
      - She’s a highly successful businesswoman

      but we do not say:

      - We had a highly tasty meal.
      - That is a highly good idea.

      We use the intensifier bitterly with the adjectives disappointed,
      unhappy and cold:

      - I was bitterly unhappy at school.
      - We were bitterly disappointed to lose the match.
      - It can get bitterly cold in winter.

      Activities:

      - My mother was a highly successful tennis player in her time. She
	won loads of tournaments.
      - The car was so seriously damaged in the  accident that it had to be
	scrapped.
      - Tom was deliriously happy when he heard he'd become a grandfather.
	He can't stop smiling.
      - I was deeply disappointed by my team's performance last night.
	It was terrible.
      - The restaurant was shut down when three people fell gravely ill
	after eating there.
      - Esther's desperately unhappy working at the bank so she's looking
	for a new job.
      - In order to be a successful detective, you need to be keenly
	observant.
      - Have I met Maria's new boyfriend? No, but I've seen him and he's
	drop-dead gorgeous!
      - Professor Jones was a universally popular head of department.
	Everyone was truly sorry to see him retire.
      - The government is firmly committed to reducing public debt, and
	is therefore bitterly opposed to any increases.

      intensifiers go with.

*** If you’ve already studied Python in any sort of depth,
    you probably already know that this is where its OOP support begins
    to become attractive:

    Structure
    With OOP,  can naturally associate processing logic with record data—classes
    provide both a program unit that combines logic and data in a single package and
    a hierarchy that allows code to be easily factored to avoid redundancy.

    Encapsulation
    With OOP,  can also wrap up details such as name processing and pay increases
    behind method functions—i.e.,  are free to change method implementations
    without breaking their users.

    Customization
    And with OOP,  have a natural growth path. Classes can be extended and cus-
    tomized by coding n subclasses, without changing or breaking already working
    code.

*** Munge/Munging/Wrangling
    Describes the overall process of manipulating unstructured and/or messy data
    into a structured or clean form. The word has snuck its way into the jargon
    of many modern day data hackers. Munge rhymes with “lunge”.

*** Interacting with the outside world
    Reading and writing with a variety of file formats and databases.

*** Preparation
    Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing, and
    transforming data for analysis.

*** Transformation
    Applying mathematical and statistical operations to groups of data sets to
    derive new data sets. For example, aggregating a large table by group variables.

*** Modeling and computation
    Connecting your data to statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other
    computational tools

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
        Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of
	programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct
	a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining
	to human beings what we want a computer to do.

	The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an
	essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of
	style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names
	of variables carefully and explains what each variable means.
	He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because
	its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for
	human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal
	methods that reinforce each other.

    – Donald Knuth

*** Getting Things Done is a time-management method, described in a book of the same title
    by productivity consultant David Allen. It is often referred to as GTD. The GTD method
    rests on the idea of moving planned tasks and projects out of the mind by recording
    them externally and then breaking them into actionable work items. This allows one to
    focus attention on taking action on tasks, instead of on recalling them.

*** Well, I may be embellishing a little, but hear me out.
*** I am not exaggerating to say that I did not understand
    a single answer she gave during the interview p.16
*** One of the most important messages that you, as a candidate,
    can convey in your intervi is hiring me will make your lives easier
*** It was a real mess; we'd inherited a nasty ball of spaghetti,
    and we needed people who could jump in, figure things out,
    and be part of the solution.
*** Sometimes, I don’t have a very good attention to detail.
    While that’s good because it lets me execute quickly, it also means
    that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make
    sure to always have someone else double check my work.

*** Core features
    In Magit staging a hunk or even just part of a hunk is as trivial as
    staging all changes made to a file.
    That being said, many users
    have reported that using Magit was what finally taught them what Git
    is capable of and how to use it to its fullest.
    Magit wraps and in many cases improves upon at least the following Git
    porcelain commands:
**** add
     Add file contents to the index
**** am
     Apply a series of patches from a mailbox
**** bisect
     Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
**** blame
     Show what revision and author last modified each line of a file
**** branch
     List, create, or delete branches
**** checkout
     Switch branches or restore working tree files
**** cherry
     Find commits not merged upstream
**** cherry-pick
     Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits
**** clean
     Remove untracked files from the working tree
**** clone
     Clone a repository into a new directory
**** commit
     Record changes to the repository
**** config
**** describe
     Describe a commit using the most recent tag reachable from it
**** diff
     Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
**** fetch
     Download objects and refs from another repository
**** format-patch
     Prepare patches for e-mail submission
**** init
**** log
     Show commit logs
**** remote
     Manage set of tracked repositories
**** request-pull
     Generates a summary of pending changes
**** reset
     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
**** revert
     Revert some existing commits
**** rm
     Remove files from the working tree and from the index
**** show
     Show various types of objects
**** stash
     Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away
**** submodule
     Initialize, update or inspect submodules
**** tag
     Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

******* Intermezzo: Coding Style
	Making it easy for others to read your code
	is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps
	tremendously for that.
	+ Suggestions:
	  - When possible, put comments on a line of their own;
	  - Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to
	use "CamelCase" for classes and "lower_case_with_underscores" for
	functions and methods.

******* Dictionaries
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	Unlike
	sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are
	indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and
	numbers can always be keys.  Tuples can be used as keys if they
	contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any
	mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a
	key. You can't use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place
	using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like "append()"
	and "extend()".

	The built-in function "dir()" is used to find out which names a module
	defines.  It returns a sorted list of strings.

	Without arguments, "dir()" lists the names you have defined currently.
	#+END_QUOTE

******* Packages
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	Packages are a way of structuring Python's module namespace by using
	"dotted module names".
	#+END_QUOTE
******** Importing * From a Package
	 For example, the file "sound/effects/__init__.py" could contain the
	 following code:
	 
	 __all__ = ["echo", "surround", "reverse"]
	 
	 This would mean that "from sound.effects import *" would import the
	 three named submodules of the "sound" package.

******** Intra-package References

          # "'!a'" (apply "ascii()"), "'!s'" (apply "str()") and "'!r'" (apply

          print('The value of PI is approximately {!r}.'.format(math.pi))
          print('=============')

          # An optional "':'" and format specifier can follow the field name. This

******* Reading and Writing Files
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	"open()" returns a *file object*, and is most commonly
	used with two arguments: "open(filename, mode)".

	>>> f = open('workfile', 'w')
	
	#+END_QUOTE

******** Methods of File Objects
	 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
	 It is good practice to use the "with" keyword when dealing with file
	 objects.  This has the advantage that the file is properly closed
	 after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised on the way.
	 It is also much shorter than writing equivalent "try"-"finally"
	 blocks:
	 #+END_QUOTE
	 #+BEGIN_SRC python
           with open('workfile', 'r') as f:
               read_data = f.read()
           f.closed
	 #+END_SRC
******** Saving structured data with "json"
	 #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session json
	 import json
	 json.dumps([1, 'simple', 'list'])
	 #+END_SRC

	 #+RESULTS:
	 : 
	 : >>> >>> >>> >>> '[1, "simple", "list"]'

****** DONE Errors and Exceptions
******* Syntax Errors
	Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most
	common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python
******* Exceptions
	Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may
	cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected
	during execution are called exceptions

******* Handling Exceptions
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session exeptions
          import sys

          try:
              f = open('myfile.txt')
              s = f.readline()
              i = int(s.strip())
          except OSError as err:
              print("OS error: {0}".format(err))
          except ValueError:
              print("Could not convert data to an integer.")
          except:
              print("Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0])
              raise

	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: >>> ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... OS error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'myfile.txt'

	The "try" ... "except" statement has an optional *else clause*, which,
	when present, must follow all except clauses.  It is useful for code
	that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception.
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session exeptions
          for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
              try:
                  f = open(arg, 'r')
              except IOError:
                  print('cannot open', arg)
              else:
                  print(arg, 'has', len(f.readlines()), 'lines')
                  f.close()

	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:

******* Raising Exceptions
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	The "raise" statement allows the programmer to force a specified
	exception to occur. For example:
	#+END_QUOTE
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session exeptions
	raise NameError('HiThere')
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: Traceback (most recent call last):
	:   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
	: NameError: HiThere
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	If you need to determine whether an exception was raised but don't
	intend to handle it, a simpler form of the "raise" statement allows
	you to re-raise the exception:
	#+END_QUOTE
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session exeptions
          try:
              raise NameError('HiThere')
          except NameError:
              print('An exception flew by!')
              raise
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: ... ... ... ... An exception flew by!
	: Traceback (most recent call last):
	:   File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
	: NameError: HiThere

******* User-defined Exceptions
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception
	class (see *Classes* for more about Python classes).  Exceptions
	should typically be derived from the "Exception" class, either
	directly or indirectly.  For example:
	#+END_QUOTE
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session exeptions
          class MyError(Exception):
              def __init__(self, value):
                  self.value = value
              def __str__(self):
                  return repr(self.value)

          try:
              raise MyError(2*2)
          except MyError as e:
              print('My exception occurred, value:', e.value)

          raise MyError('oops!')
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 
	: ... ... ... ... >>> ... ... ... ... My exception occurred, value: 4
	: Traceback (most recent call last):
	:   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
	: __main__.MyError: 'oops!'

******* Defining Clean-up Actions
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	A ~finally~ clause is always executed before leaving the "try"
	statement, whether an exception has occurred or not. When an exception
	has occurred in the "try" clause and has not been handled by an
	"except" clause (or it has occurred in an "except" or "else" clause),
	it is re-raised after the "finally" clause has been executed.  The
	"finally" clause is also executed "on the way out" when any other
	clause of the "try" statement is left via a "break", "continue" or
	"return" statement.
	#+END_QUOTE
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session exeptions
          def divide(x, y):
              try:
                  result = x / y
              except ZeroDivisionError:
                  print("division by zero!")
              else:
                  print("result is", result)
              finally:
                  print("executing finally clause")

          divide(2, 1)
          print('=============')
          divide(2, 0)
          print('=============')
          divide("2", "1")
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	#+begin_example

	... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... >>> result is 2.0
	executing finally clause
	=============
	division by zero!
	executing finally clause
	=============
	executing finally clause
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
	  File "<stdin>", line 3, in divide
	TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'
#+end_example

	In real world applications, the "finally" clause is useful for
	releasing external resources (such as files or network connections),
	regardless of whether the use of the resource was successful.

******* Predefined Clean-up Actions
	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	The "with" statement allows objects
	like files to be used in a way that ensures they are always cleaned up
	promptly and correctly.	
	#+END_QUOTE
	#+BEGIN_SRC python
          with open("myfile.txt") as f:
              for line in f:
                  print(line, end="!")
	#+END_SRC

	After the statement is executed, the file ~f~ is always closed, even
	if a problem was encountered while processing the lines.

******* A First Look at Classes
******** Class Definition Syntax
******** Class Objects
	 Support two kinds of operations:
	 - attribute references
	   #+BEGIN_SRC python
             class MyClass:
                 """A simple example class"""

	   #+END_SRC
	 - instantiation
	   #+BEGIN_SRC python
	   x = MyClass()
	   #+END_SRC

******** Instance Objects
	 - Data attributes
	 - Methods

******** Method Objects

******** Class and Instance Variables
	 #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session classes

       Much terse and dense solution:

         seq = sequence_class(immutable=False)

**** Writing Idiomatic Python					     :idioma:
***** 1 Control Structures and Functions
****** 1.1 If Statements
******* 1.1.1 Avoid comparing directly to True , False , or None
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output

	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:

******* 1.1.2 Avoid repeating variable name in compound if statement
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
         is_generic_name = False
         name = 'Tom'
         if name == 'Tom' or name == 'Dick' or name == 'Harry':

         print(is_generic_name)
       #+END_SRC

       #+RESULTS:

******* 1.1.3 Avoid placing conditional branch code on the same line as
       the colon
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
         name = 'Jeff'
         address = 'New York, NY'

       : New York, NY
       : Jeff
       : New York, NY

****** 1.2 For loops       
******* 1.2.1 Use the enumerate function in loops instead of creating an “index” variable
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
          my_container = ['Larry', 'Moe', 'Curly']
          for index, element in enumerate(my_container):

	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: 0 Larry
	: 1 Moe
	: 2 Curly

******* 1.2.2 Use the in keyword to iterate over an iterable
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
          my_list = ['Larry', 'Moe', 'Curly']
          for element in my_list:
              print (element)
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:
	: Larry
	: Moe
	: Curly

******* 1.2.3 Use else to execute code after a for loop concludes
	#+BEGIN_SRC python
          for user in get_all_users():
              print ('Checking {}'.format(user))
              for email_address in user.get_all_email_addresses():

                      print ('Has a malformed email address!')
                      break
              else:  # for loop successfully iterated all items
                  print ('All email addresses are valid!')
	#+END_SRC

	#+RESULTS:

****** 1.3 Functions
******* 1.3.1 Avoid using '' , [] , and {} as default parameters to functions
	#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
          # The default value [of a function] is evaluated only once.
          # This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object
          # such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. For
          # example, the following function accumulates the arguments
          # passed to it on subsequent calls.
          def f(a, L=[]):

	#+BEGIN_SRC python
          def make_api_call(foo, bar, baz, *args, **kwargs):
              # Now I can accept any type and number of arguments

              return baz_coefficient in new_function(args)
	#+END_SRC
***** 2 Working with Data
****** 2.1 Lists
****** 2.1.1 Use a list comprehension to create a transformed version
       of an existing list
       #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
         # Harmful

         some_other_list = range(10)
         some_list = list()
         for element in some_other_list:
             if is_prime(element):
                 some_list.append(element + 5)

         # Idiomatic               

         some_other_list = range(10)
         some_list = [element + 5 for
                      element in some_other_list if
                      is_prime(element)]
       #+END_SRC
****** 2.1.2 Use the * operator to represent the “rest” of a list
****** 2.2 Dictionaries
       2.2.1 Use the default parameter of dict.get to provide default
       values
       2.2.2 Use a dict comprehension to build a dict clearly and
       efficiently
****** 2.3 Strings
       2.3.1 Prefer the format function for formatting strings
       2.3.2 Use ''.join when creating a single string for list elements
       2.3.3 Chain string functions to make a simple series of transfor-
       mations more clear
****** 2.4 Classes
       2.4.1 Use underscores in function and variable names to help mark
       “private” data
       2.4.2 Define __str__ in a class to show a human-readable repre-
       sentation
****** 2.5 Sets
       2.5.1 Use sets to eliminate duplicate entries from Iterable con-
       tainers
       2.5.2 Use a set comprehension to generate sets concisely
       2.5.3 Understand and use the mathematical set operations
****** 2.6 Generators
       2.6.1 Use a generator to lazily load infinite sequences
       2.6.2 Prefer a generator expression to a list comprehension
       for simple iteration
****** 2.7. Context Managers
       2.7.1 Use a context manager to ensure resources are properly
       managed
****** 2.8. Tuples
       2.8.1 Use tuples to unpack data
       2.8.2 Use _ as a placeholder for data in a tuple that should be
       ignored
****** 2.9 Variables
       2.9.1 Avoid using a temporary variable when performing a swap
       of two values
***** 3 Organizing Your Code
****** 3.1 Modules and Packages
       3.1.1 Use modules for encapsulation where other languages would
       use Objects
****** 3.2 Formatting
       3.2.1 Use all capital letters when declaring global constant values
       3.2.2 Avoid placing multiple statements on a single line
       3.2.3 Format your code according to PEP8
****** 3.3. Executable Scripts
       3.3.1 Use sys.exit in your script to return proper error codes
       3.3.2 Use the if __name__ == '__main__' pattern to allow a
       file to be both imported and run directly
****** 3.4 Imports
       3.4.1 Prefer absolute imports to relative imports
       3.4.2 Do not use from foo import * to import the contents of a
       module.
       3.4.3 Arrange your import statements in a standard order
***** 4 General Advice
****** 4.1 Avoid Reinventing the Wheel
       4.1.1 Learn the Contents of the Python Standard Library
       4.1.2 Get to know PyPI (the Python Package Index)
****** 4.2 Modules of Note
       4.2.1 Learn the contents of the itertools module
       4.2.2 Use functions in the os.path module when working with
       directory paths
